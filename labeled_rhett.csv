Most of whom are, (as far as I know because they havent shared their medical history), in pretty good general health. But all i see in the kitchen is laxative icecream and brain bait-and-switch sweetener and that cooking spray that you have to spray 2000 times to cook anything. And one knows I've struggled with DE and yet she feels the need to soapbox about doing le clean diet anyway.

I hate diet culture. That said, I don't hate the people who get sucked into it. My flatmates are just trying to live their lives without getting shamed or food-policed. But I hate it when people foist it on everyone else or deny that it's a thing or pass it off as something mundane like a ""lifestyle"".

I also hate Covid. That said, I don't hate the people who catch it and struggle with it. They lose their jobs and can't get furloughed and face domestic violence and need their neighbours' help to buy a pint of milk. But I hate it when people intentionally spread it around or claim it's a government conspiracy or something mundane like the flu. 

And as much as I hate the misuse of the concepts of an epidemic or pandemic, and don't want to sound like I'm mocking people who died or lost loved ones to Covid, I feel like, well, like there are more diet culture cases than Covid cases."

I've decided to take it seriously, lose the weight and change the lifestyle before I am older and regret my choices.

I will not be very restrictive but rather monitor how much I eat (my problem is snacking + the size of my portions), using an app to track amount of calories and healthy levels of protein, fat and carbs. The amount of calories will be my basal metabolic rate which currently is around the 1,600 cal. 

I already exercise a few times a week, so I guess I should be good on that end.

Of course I know intuitive eating is about what makes you feel good and energised but it's just a bit discouraging when you're not there at all after almost a year of IE (and I never had an ED, I just got sick of trying to diet and restrict every few months which inevitably led to binges), like I look at them and I'm like I'm never going to be those people who eat greens every day because they want to and work out because they truly enjoy it... sometimes it feels like I'm just watching a random fitness/weight loss channel haha the transition just seems so out of reach for me.."

Blocked. This is a bummer because it was very civil, and gave perspective to the discussion. Everyone else was being cool, too.

My cues for hunger and fullness are totally messed up and I‚Äôm only seventeen. I have a bad habit of overeating. almost daily or just eating to eat and often times this leaves me feeling miserable and I know most people say that if you‚Äôre overeating than you‚Äôre restricting in some way but I don‚Äôt know how? I mean sure I have thoughts about food but it‚Äôs unrealistic for me to go out and get everything I think about I just start eating and I get the cue that I‚Äôm full but it‚Äôs like leaving something on my plate is taboo even though my parents never forced that on me and I have food in my house so nothing is limited which makes it even harder for me to understand why I keep putting myself through this same cycle. I know the food is there I see it so why do I keep eating when I‚Äôm full? As far as my hunger I don‚Äôt know if I would have such a problem recognizing it as much as I gave waiting for it if that makes sense? I know a lot of people say that thinking if food is a sign of hunger but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs reliable for me because I do get full quickly and easily even if my stomach is growling I guess I just want to rush the feeling so I can eat. I recently brought it up to my therapist and she recommended a food journal but I‚Äôm not sure what to write for it to be helpful some people says on a previous post of mine this could be harmful but I‚Äôm not really restrictive with my food intake. I read some of the book but it didn‚Äôt seem helpful to me maybe because of my age I just felt like it was more so chronic dieters which for me isn‚Äôt really the case I had one summer of calorie counting and a chronic dieter step mom.

Hi everyone,

I hope this is allowed here.

I‚Äôve been reading a lot about intuitive eating for a few weeks now and after talking to my therapist, yesterday I did a full day of eating intuitively. For me, this meant throwing out all my ‚Äúrules‚Äù around food and as a result I ate breakfast at work for the first time, well, ever, and ate lunch an hour earlier than I usually do. Then, around midnight for some reason I was starving in bed so I got up and ate a snack‚Äîalso something I would never have allowed myself in the past!

I have a history with EDs, however, and I just read a post on r/fatlogic about intuitive eating that seriously scared me. The person said that in 6 months of IE, they gained 22lbs. 

I feel myself backing out of this journey and could really just use some extra encouragement. I know weight gain isn‚Äôt supposed to matter, but if I gained 22lbs I feel I would have a major problem on my hands and would spiral even more. Have a lot of people gained weight after starting IE?"

I still have a long way to go, but it‚Äôs a bit surreal, as I haven‚Äôt been at a weight this low in 11 years. I also bought some new clothes and have gone down a shirt size and down two sizes in my jeans. My next goal is 100 lbs lost, so I probably won‚Äôt make a post next month, but when I hit that.

I used to be a good student throughout my high schools, and now I am preparing for an entrance exam. Now I whenever I goto study, my brain kept asking me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? It asks me really terrible questions, Why I have to Study ? What is my motivation ? And the anxiety created by not studying at all is haunting me. I literally wakes up multiple times in night. And felt really bad about it, that my exam is near and haven't studied but when I goto study my brain again bombard with me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? I really cannot describe the problem. It just doesn't let me focus on my study. When I search for my purpose ? I got blank answer which really demotivates me just pushing me back in this cycle. How can I help myself out of this problem ? What my purpose can be ? Or knowing that purpose really important enough ? Or it is just my brain trying to circumvent the hardships of preparation. 

I am so deeply entrenched in this never ending depression, that now I cannot even decide what is good or bad ? 

Please take some time , as It can help someone like me. I also tries hard to remember from my past, how I used to perform so good earlier but I never get the answer. 


My questions are 
1. What is my purpose can be ?
2. Or knowing that purpose that the self help books and other claims is just a stupid concept and knowing it will not create any difference ?
3. Should I just keep myself busy ? How can I stop my brain or ignore it questions ?

It's been going well, I'm gaining weight, I'm getting the body I want, my mental health was good up until this week and I'm generally just getting better.

And I still am at peace with food, but also having a bit of a concern. Since last Monday, I feel like I could eat all day. I am never really satiated, even though I eat quite a lot of food.

9734,1,"During lockdown and this whole pandemic obviously I‚Äôve spent a lot of time at home... making me become consciously aware of what I‚Äôm eating everyday and disgusted in myself for it too..

Over the past 6 months it has been a battle, let me tell you. So I‚Äôve always struggled with my eating habits anyway, but I‚Äôve always just subconsciously eaten whatever right? At the start of lockdown like everyone else I was like ‚Äòokay it‚Äôs time to sort my weight out and hit those goals‚Äô 6 months later and I am the embodiment of a couch potato and I‚Äôve put on weight. How?

Well, I was trying to loose weight which in turn made me very conscious of what I was eating, trying diets, trying to eat healthy, I had fallen into the vicious cycle of binge eating.. so in my head if I had failed my diet one day I thought ‚Äòfuck it might aswell eat bad for the rest of the day‚Äô (btw ‚Äòfailing‚Äô my diet was because I had a piece of bread and wasn‚Äôt carb free...!!!) so because I ‚Äòfailed‚Äô I‚Äôd order takeaway.. lots of takeaways.. and go to the store buy so much shit and just eat it. Now. After the first day of this it would last for about 2 weeks. Everyday. Takeaway, junk food, fizzy pop. I don‚Äôt even want to think about what I consumed because ew. But THEN I‚Äôve become addicted... like I genuinely can‚Äôt stop ordering food and I‚Äôve fallen into a vicious cycle that I don‚Äôt know how to get out of..

I can honestly say it is the biggest challenge to go one day without a takeaway and junk food.. I don‚Äôt cook anymore, in my head if I‚Äôm going to eat toast which in the diet world is considered bad I might aswell just have an XXL pizza right? 

Honestly the diet community has fucked my eating habits up so bad, so many rules and different things to follow it‚Äôs driven me crazy and I‚Äôve picked up the worst eating habits.

Before I could eat toast with butter without feeling guilty and feel like I‚Äôve failed so I may aswell have a takeout..

I‚Äôve been trying to get out of this cycle but now that I see every food that isn‚Äôt a salad as ‚Äòbad‚Äô it‚Äôs difficult. Honestly, reading into weight loss was the worst thing I ever did because there are SO many ideas and theories out there and SO many different diets to follow that it‚Äôs just sent me into a spiral and I‚Äôve ended up putting on weight.

I miss the mindset I used to have, I used to just eat when I was hungry, not eat late at night and not have this guilt placed into my brain about certain foods because of diet culture..."

A few people recommended to me to focus less on the scale and more my measurements, how clothes fit, etc. But I feel like it's been the opposite for me because my scales are showing me steady progress but my measurements have barely budged!

I've lost a bit off my hips so I'm most perplexed about my waist measurement since it hasn't changed at all. And I don't mean it's every so slowly going down on the tape measure, I mean it's been somehow stuck solidly at 32' and it's admittedly super frustrating.

As time passed, I became to only get validation from other people, and the asian beauty standards began to make me feel awful about myself.

I downloaded a dating app and met a guy I was really interested in, and spent a lot of time with him, and we ended up dating. The problem is though, whenever he wouldn‚Äôt message me all day, or say he‚Äôd come to see me and end up not doing that, i‚Äôd feel so insecure about our relationship. I relied on him too much to be happy and be company for me, so recently for myself, I talked to him about it and we both mutually agreed to put a break on things while I figure out how to accept myself and feel OK with being alone. 
I want to become more reliant on myself and less about other people. I want to learn to love myself and not wait for other people to love me. I want to enjoy spending time by myself. does anyone have any tips, or any advice that might help?"

We have Jack and we have Frank

Jack and frank are both asked to play a game. However, they are being investigated and the rules for the both of them are a bit different.

Jack whenever he loses a level, he loses 5 points out of a total 200 points

Frank doesn‚Äôt even know points exist and just plays.

Now who do we think would complete more levels and be more successful at the game

I thought Jack would, since seeing his points go down after every turn, he‚Äôs going to force himself to get better so he won‚Äôt lose more points.

But actually, I was wrong

The guy who didn‚Äôt lose any points actually did better.

This example comes from Mark Rober‚Äôs Ted talk ‚ÄúThe Super Mario Effect‚Äù

If we put ourselves in the place of each guy during the game, we could picture Jack getting anxious and frustrated after every failure. He‚Äôs seeing his score go down and every time he looks towards it, he remembers all his past failures. And when they happen again or he fails multiple times on the same level, he beats himself up more for it.

Then we look at Frank. He doesn‚Äôt have this big bright red score making the same annoying sound effects after he loses, in fact he doesn‚Äôt even see it as a failure.

Maybe Frank fell off a cliff but all he‚Äôs doing is saying ok, I got to remember not to do that next time. He doesn‚Äôt recognise it as a failure but a piece of info that he has gathered that could help him.

I watched this video and I was thinking to myself but what if I could just not fail. Won‚Äôt that be better. I beat the system that way no matter what world I‚Äôm in, right?

Mark Rober was like ‚ÄúHmmm idk about that‚Äù

Video games are very similar to life, we complete a few tasks it could be putting a ball at the back of a goal or defeating an evil dinosaur.

In Mario if there were no obstacles, and the pathway was clear and straight, who would play that? it would be boring.

But add in some monsters, a few things to climb and some puzzles and you got yourself a game that ppl are willing to pay money to play.

Without failures and a challenge, a goal doesn‚Äôt feel exciting and worthwhile to pursue.

So basically, we have to accept failure but not let it overwhelm us, once we look at it as a learning experience and an obstacle that we will overcome, things will work out in your favour."

It stems from my job - 50 to 100 emails a day, always on the clock, company-wide group chat, phone calls at any hour, deadlines, social media dings, questions and chatter from colleagues, on and on.

From there it's my social network - my friends, and my family. These are people that I love and want in my life, but my dad is retired and I am his world so he texts me all throughout the day. Certain higher maintenance friends guilt me into feeling I have wronged them by being so busy. To take much-needed time for me feels simultaneously like a step in the wrong direction from those who want more of my presence.

The list continues but I won't bore you.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I get overwhelmed by the sheer level of demand put on me by external forces, and then that overwhelm turns into resentment.

I resent every time my boss emails me, I resent every time my dad texts me, I resent every time my beloved dog fights for my attention. Considering these are all things I'm very grateful for, that initial pang of resentment is pretty fucked up.

10092,0,"Edit: I thought I typed ""underestimates"" in the title. 

Yesterday, I was reading a world atlas from 2007. There were statistics in the back, and I noticed that Eritreans consumed on average 1,590 kcal a day and Ethiopians consumed 1,950 kcal a day. I just looked up data right now, and even the hungriest countries consume ""too many"" calories according to diet culture (I'm fully aware that they don't live their lives the same way Americans do but that isn't the point). 

I was looking at Chocolate Covered Katie's blog (I like her recipes even though her blog comes across as diet-y sometimes), and she made some posts about what she eats in a day. She consumes around 2,900-3,000 calories in a day (she includes calorie counts at the bottom).¬† Some of the comments were like, ""If you consume that many calories, how are you not obese?"" I think that people don't understand that some women actually need that in order to function properly. 

During the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, they cut the caloric intake of these men down to 1,560, and yet you see grown men on 1,500 calorie diets. I really don't think that that's enough for them. I follow my body's natural hunger and fullness cues, and I think I consume more than 1,500 kcal on most days and I'm a five foot tall woman (I don't count calories and so I wouldn't know for sure). 

Some people might say things like ""yeah well maybe some people can consume that many calories because they have quicker metabolisms."" The thing is that caloric restriction slows down your metabolism, and people are supposed to be at different body weights. 

And pro-diet people always talk about how in Japan they're all super healthy because they ""eat so little,"" but the average daily caloric intake of a Japanese person over one year old was 1,930 in 2002. And that mean average includes toddlers who are supposed to eat around 1,200 a day. And people talk about how Americans ""eat too much,"" but  European countries don't consume much less than we do. Both the healthiest and hungriest countries consume excess calories according to diet culture. 

I have a co-worker who is trying to lose weight,  and yet she started off with a BMI of 21.9. She was likely at her body's natural set point, and yet she was brainwashed by the media into believing that she needs to be super thin and is now ruining her metabolism. The average woman even in the hungriest countries is ""fat"" by modeling standards and probably doesn't have flat abs. I once had some idiot tell me that a woman who is my height should be weighing 90 pounds and that I'm fat, but most women here on planet Earth are ""fat"" if you think that a woman's BMI should be 17.6 (which is actually officially considered ""underweight""). 

Sorry if this was too long, but it is truly upsetting that starvation is the norm in diet culture. And all it's doing is ruining people's mental health, causing deaths and contributing even more to the so called ""obesity epidemic."" Starvation doesn't help one lose weight long term. 

(Please please don't make comments like ""I eat 900 calories a day and I'm perfectly fine"" and ""some people have slower metabolisms."")"

9851,0,"Hi all,

I have had some negative feelings about my weight and body so I wanted to reach out for support. 

I am not sure how much of my background is relevant, but I will try to sum it up. I am a middle aged mom now. I intentionally lost a significant amount of weight in my 20s due to dieting and exercising in an obsessive way. Nothing ""diagnostic"" for ED but like fully bought into diet culture and a lot of anxiety about weight and body. I slowly came back to a more natural way of eating as I entered my 30s and was able to enjoy food more and not see exercise compulsively. I was in a good place with my self image and my relaxed attitude with food until I got pregnant. My pregnancy was great, but afterwards I had severe PPD requiring hospitalization and serious psych meds. The meds saved my life, but also caused a lot of weight gain. It's been hard for me to sort out how much of the weight gain was hormonal, postpartum, stress, medication but anyhow they all added up to significant weight gain. I will not use any numbers, but I am far above my previous highest weight before I started dieting in my 20s.

I think because I am older now, I have been able to be more kind to myself and not worry so much about my weight and appearance. But of course, the thoughts are still there. A lot. I had made peace (for the most part) with never losing any of the weight and I am trying to instill a healthy relationship and attitude with weight with my child. My weight has been pretty stable for a few years, ever since I weaned off one of my medications. 

But then came quarantine. 

At first, I was kind of smug about the fact that I wasn't worried about gaining weight when I saw other people panicking about it. But then a few pounds came on and I was not so smug anymore. I am kind of freaking out. My clothes don't fit quite the same. I feel physically heavier going up and down stairs. I am getting heartburn. My eating habits haven't really changed, and I exercise daily (not in a punishing way, just a workout that makes me feel physically and mentally great), but of course I am mostly homebound, so I am sure I am getting deconditioned. Today I plan to wear a swimsuit and yeah . . . I'm not feeling great about that. But I also don't want to have my kid seeing me feel ashamed of my body. But like . . . it's not just appearance at this point. I don't like heartburn. I don't like feeling like I can't walk as fast and as hard as I want to. I want to keep up with my kid. I just can't bear the thought of gaining any more weight. 

I don't even know what I am looking for here. Maybe just some empathy. Thanks all!"

I have read the IE book. I have a history of different eating disorders since 2013, and currently struggling with bulimic tendencies. So I have a lot of subconscious food rules that I've developed over the course of 8 years.

This might be a really obvious realisation; in fact, I think it is a very trivial realisation for most people. 

Whenever I have a pack of things, or bake a batch of things that can be counted in numbers (like cookies, pieces of brownies, or candies in a bag with different colours) I always feel the need to eat a complete group of them (eg: if I was eating Haribos, I would them in sets - one set including a piece of gummy in each colour). This applies to leaving foods uneaten as well: I would need to leave cookies in pairs, or have an even number or one of each variety (of flavours/colours) so that I can also eat it correctly the next time. It sounds a bit crazy, but it was just a compulsion that I would always feel. As far as I know I don't have ADHD or OCD, or any diagnosed mental disorder/illness... so I think I'm just very particular about having the ""perfect set"" to eat if I leave any leftovers.

Yesterday, I fried some sesame balls filled with red bean filling (delicious), and there were 10 of them. I ate 2 - an even number - and wanted a third, but didn't want to leave behind seven balls. So, I decided not to eat a third. A few hours later, I really wanted another ball, so convinced myself that I could eat another one, and would not indulge my compulsion to eat a fourth so that I could leave behind an even number. So, I ate a third ball and resisted the fourth. 

It sounds so trivial but it was such a huge thing for me. I woke up this morning and had one sesame ball with my coffee, and didn't feel a compulsion to check to see if there were still an even number of sesame balls left for later. I guess I am starting to realise that my own satiation and cravings are justification enough to eat, and that I don't have to follow these strange rules I have set for myself."

12664,0,"Affirmations have a very positive reputation in this community which is baffling to me because yes they do make a superficial improvements but the price for this is just too much.

What affirmations basically do is that you enforce something which is not inherently real through repetition and it's basically hypnotizing yourself or brainwashing yourself. I believe if you have issues with self worth you need to understand why those issues are there and observe how your mind works, what triggeres those patterns etc. The mind is a very sensitive thing and just raw dogging your way into feeling worthy is never gonna work and is dysfunctional and abnormal it's like when you see the victims of a cult that believe in some very irrational things because they were being told what to believe everyday from the moment they wake up until they sleep. A mind that is being constantly forced to think a certain way would lose it's sensitivity to life, joy and creativity. Point is if your mental foundations are shaky and are the result of deep burried psychological issues from childhood to whatever age you're in rightnow the wisest decision would be to adresse those issue at their roots not deluding yourself into believing otherwise. As this is a self improvement community it goes against everything this stands for because you've limited yourself into a psychological box in which you think and believe you're worthy but in reality what dictates almost of 95% of the way we think, feel and act is unconscious and it just screams worthlessness so what you believe and what you feel/do  are in opposition so you've just created for yourself another source of inward resistance which breeds conflict, rigidity and lack of creativity. If you want to to really dive deep in this journey of improving one's self, understanding your problems and basically go through the biggest life transformation possible then being direct and not lying to yourself is crucial. To conclude instead of affirmations learn how to observe the workings of your mind throughout the day and the more you understand about yourself the deeper you'll reach.

Mindfulness is key."

I have been doing 10,000 step walks (about 4.5-5 miles) 5 days a week for the past 2 years or so. I started originally when I was approaching 200 pounds because I was stressing out about where I was and was not happy. I got a fitbit which I've been using daily since and in about 5 months or so I went from around 199 to 160. I have always been the type of person to enjoy eating food and it helps my mood but at the same time that means I've also struggled with always being able to have perfect self control. Since reaching the original goal of 160 my weight has slowly gone up to 172.6 and I have been eating more than I feel like I should (I have not been keeping track but it's probably close to about 3000-3200 calories a day on average). I just wanted some advice on if it would be the right idea to try to go back down to around 160-165 again and just what the best weight range and calorie count I should be aiming for. I just want to know if it would make sense to change anything/lose more weight or if I'm fine with what I'm currently doing and the average calorie count I currently have. If it is important the main thing that is causing me concern is mainly that for the most part I'm pretty thin and have thin arms and such but most of my extra weight goes to my stomach area (a family thing) and so if there is something specific for that that I should be doing instead that would be greatly appreciated.

9667,0,"EDITS ****
I wrote ""fresh"" originally when I should have added the word ""prepared"" in reference to Food stamps, not meaning to exclude produce or meats. Sorry for the error. 

EDIT 2 ***
This post is a critique of our flawed food, health and social services system, and how diet culture plays a large part in classism. Not all of these points will apply to everyone, nor does pointing out purely systemic issues mean I'm ignorant of personal responsibility and factors we are able to control. Please be kind to one another and don't make character assumptions.

EDIT 3 *** 
I'm seeing the most backlash around the comment that cheap foods are often low in nutritional value. Just eat beans, rice, frozen veg or grow your own, etc. And it bums me out a bit that this is the biggest point of contention.

 I didn't say it's impossible to get nutritious food for cheap, just that much of the wellness industry pushes for expensive ingredients, and that having a low income certainly affects our options and often food choices. There are a billion threads you could comment on to provide advice/hacks on thrifty eating, stress management, surviving poverty, self motivation and personal responsibility. I'm sure this is coming from a place of wanting to help but this doesn't address how inequality affects health outcomes which is kind of the whole point of this post. It kind of proves my point that we would much rather blame a person's health on laziness and assume they make bad choices than consider the bigger picture of what other factors may be at play.

Alright incoming rant.

One of the biggest things about diet culture and toxic nutrition and fitness gurus that boils my blood is the fact that everyone pushes the blame of health issues and ""obesity"" on individual choice.

""It's just calories in calories out!""

""You need to avoid processed foods, eat organic and read all labels""

""You're fat because you don't care about your health""

""We're sick because of all the junk food we eat""

""If you binge or eat when you aren't hungry you just lack discipline""

So we get a new diet every year. We're told to cut out GMOS, buy organic, and carefully consider where our food comes from. Expensive organic grocery stores pop up in gentrified areas like mushrooms.  Documentaries are dedicated to demonizing processed food and telling us we're killing ourselves. But no one seems to want to address the fact that stressful jobs, barely making a living wage, lack of healthcare access, and socioeconomics play massively on our health outcomes.


You can't buy fresh prepared food on foodstamps.

You can't see a dietitian or personal trainer if you can't afford healthcare.

If you grew up poor, or with parents that grew up poor, you were likely born into the mentality of food insecurity, always finishing your plate and eating as much as you could because you didn't know when food would be around again. 

If money is tight, you will buy the most food you can get for your dollar to feed your family, and I can guarantee that's not going to be organic quinoa and grass fed meats.

Diet culture is so fucking steeped in classism that we'd rather blame the most marginalized bodies and groups of people than consider fixing our health care, education, food production and wages to actually give people a fighting chance at taking care of themselves physically and mentally. 

Instead we build more Whole foods in rich neighborhoods, shame others for their food choices and size, and turn ""health"" into a virtue contest to brag about to our friends and family.

I don't even know how to direct this anger into something productive because it's such an ingrained, systemic problem. At the moment I'm just working on reading, researching, and trying to see if I can realistically help make change, but it feels like such a titanic machine of an industry to fight against."
13356,0,"I've been working on intuitive eating for about a year. And I've never been so free and happy.

I'm in the UK and I've been staying at home with my 2 kids whilst we have to stay at home. I'm eating exactly the same I did before the virus. I have no idea how I would be coping if I was on restriction. Sitting home with 2 small children all day thinking about food. 

I did think more in the begining because of the panic buying and I didn't want to run out of food for the family. I'm finding now that I'm still eating when hungry but not always going to my first choice because of having to make the food last. 

I just wanted to share my joy and I hope others are feeling the peace that comes with IE in these anxiety inducing times."
13051,0,"I want to preface by saying: if you‚Äôre recovering from an eating disorder (esp. if it was orthorexia) or disordered eating ‚Äî and even if you‚Äôve never had one or are fully recovered: This is not a call out post. I am NOT trying to guilt people.

This is me trying to work through some difficulties that I have with the IE movement as a relatively recent resident of Canada. 

Anyway, my main point of contention (or kind of) is that IE is highly individualistic. This is not a problem ‚Äî esp. in recovery ‚Äî but I do feel that it encourages consumption that does not take into account larger processes and mechanisms of food production? 

And please ... please do not trot out trite replies like, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no ethical consumption under capitalism,‚Äù because /there/ is a role that western consumers play in the continued subjugation of labour in the global south and there is agency there. This is not to say we all get bogged down in guilt ‚Äî abolitionists wore clothes made by slaves while fighting for abolition. That doesn‚Äôt invalidate their point or their efforts to get rid of an awful system. But, I‚Äôm not really doing that. Most of us aren‚Äôt. 

However ... I guess, I‚Äôm thinking of things like cashews, or coffee (which I know seems horrendously essential), or chocolate. The little treats. When most of the supply comes from labour that is so exploited so as to bring actual tears to my eyes, how can I justify mindlessly buying things (and tbh Fair Trade is problematic as well) because they satisfy ME? 

[It doesn‚Äôt mean that my actual behaviour is different either. I do buy hot chocolate once in a while too.]

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering how to square with the kind of lifestyle a lot of IE followers tend to lead: with lots of snacks, lots of variety, etc. Which is fine, because ... same. 

So yeah, to repeat myself: I‚Äôm concerned about how IE is framed as the most natural way of eating in a culture filled with highly palatable, engineered, and MARKETED food (and drink) that uses resources and labour that do not need to be exploited (and frankly, couldn‚Äôt exist without exploitation. See: Coca Cola) 

An economic and cultural landscape where the implications of  ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù consumption means consumption divorced from /accountability/ for fear of re-introducing guilt. I don‚Äôt know how I can justify eating without at least Some Guilt at Some Point (I‚Äôm not crying every time I drink a coke lol). And this isn‚Äôt a distant problem for me. The cashew processing plants that are in the news for the awful working conditions are close to my hometown. 

I Am Not Saying That You Guys Should Feel Bad. Especially for those in food deserts or in poverty (and EDs, etc.) although in my opinion those conditions likely limit your ability to truly eat intuitively. 

I guess I‚Äôm saying that I do. Feel bad, that is. And I don‚Äôt know where to go from here."
14355,0,"And how far do I push myself?

I am trying to follow [this]( exercise video and try to get a little further in every time I exercise. I got to 20 minutes once, with a break. And 11 minutes without one. When I went for 20 minutes I got one of the worst headaches I have had in a long time, and just generally felt awful. It was a bit scary so I haven't pushed myself like that again.   
I wasn't dehydrated, I made sure to drink plenty in between exercises.... So that wasn't the issue.

But yeah aside from that, I intended on exercising every other day. But I noticed that usually the other day, my muscles are still quit tired and I can't go for more than 5 minutes before needing to stop. Should I keep trying to exercise with this video every other day? Or take a two day pause in between?  
And how far do I push myself? Is taking breaks ok if I last longer that way?  
I don't know much about exercising, so any advice is appreciated.

Information that might help, I am morbidly obese (390 pounds/5'8/172cm). I was extremely sedentary for three years, didn't take more than a hundred steps some days. Fall of last year I got more active, and I went from 100 to 3000 steps a day, some days 6000. It came with some issues, but I ended up adjusting to being more active in a few months...  
Hence why I decided it might be good to try and exercise to build up my stamina a bit more."

13387,0,"One of the best things about IE for me is knowing there is more food, there will be more food, I can put leftovers in the fridge and come back later, this isn't the last time there will be food so just eat until you feel sastified. But seeing constant pictures of supermarket shelves empty, even though I have stocked up on pasta and rice, and now I'm sick and in semi isolation because I have flu symptoms I am going to that unconscious mindset that dieters are in.

I‚Äôve never been athletic or into exercise, and even in my strongest dieting phases I couldn‚Äôt get into a routine, or find my ‚Äúthing‚Äù that I really liked to do.

13274,1,"I thought I knew what being satisfied after a meal felt like. I thought it was just ""being kind of full"".
But no, satisfaction is a whole other feeling I didn't even know I could have.

I have been practicing intuitive eating (and the F\*ck it diet) for a couple of months now and have really started to lean into complete permission to eat **anything** and **everything** in **any quantity** I want.
For so long I was scared I would just not stop eating, but I just decided; you know what, ""f\*uck it""!
And I went HAM.

I ate everything I craved. I ate past fullness a lot and have felt uncomfortably full many times. But I kept eating what and how much I craved.
I definitely gained some weight, but that felt good and safe. I was feeding my body and making the panic stop by lovingly saying: ""see, there is no famine. There is food, and you can have as much of it as you want.""

After two weeks of doing this, I was eating an evening snack and I suddenly felt a feeling I don't remember ever feeling before after a meal.
Such a soft, gentle feeling.
And then it suddenly dawned on me that this is what satisfaction feels like. I felt comfortably full and... satisfied.

wow.

I have never felt this feeling before....

Sure, I have felt full, but *satisfied*?
I don't think satisfaction ever had the chance to enter the chat when guilt, shame, obsessive food thoughts and restriction where hogging the server.

In the next couple of days this feeling kept happening! I would eat what I craved, a nice meal and then boom, all of a sudden; \*ahh\* I''m satisfied.
I can have more later if I want, but I'm just, cool right now.

And I move on.
And don't think about food all that much for the next couple of hours, until I'm hungry again.

WHAT?! How is this possible!? This is wild.
I am so surprised, and am wondering if any of you ever had a similar experi√´nce.

Also, for those of you who think you will never stop eating, binge forever and never be satisfied: 
You will stop eating, you won't binge forever and you *will* be satisfied, it might just catch you by surprise."
