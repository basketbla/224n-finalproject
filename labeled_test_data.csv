8785,1,"I struggle a lot with my body image, I want to be skinny so bad. I started starving myself a couple months ago, it started with just restricting a little to eating roughly around 500 calories a day maybe a little more or less. And I’ve been trying to start eating again with the help of a friend and today I had around 1000 calories worth of food. And I feel horrible worse than I’ve felt in a couple of days. I feel like it’s getting really bad again and I don’t know what to do. I cried today even thinking about food I feel like throwing up and I started working out again till I can’t do anything anymore. I’m so exhausted. I’m not diagnosed with anything like an ED or anything but I feel like this is one idk."
6186,1,"I feel so ugly, I don't look in the mirror for days. I became so insecure especially with all the intrusive thoughts. My teenage years were wasted on insecurity. I feel like no boy would ever be attracted to me. I don't go anywhere not even school. keep getting suicidal thoughts and sometimes hurt myself intentionally because I don't like my face, skin and myself. I'm always anxious and scared and have no one to tell. I'm really suffering. I can't even shower or study or eat like a normal human being. I'm tired. I'm underweight and unhealthy but I can't even get myself to cook healthy food because of the intrusive thoughts and the fear. I don't want to live anymore it's so exhausting."
5240,1,"I’m being admitted sometime this week and I was wondering if anyone had been and can give me some info on what it was like/ if it helped them. I truly want to recover but I can’t from home as no one can force me to eat and not purge. I also think not having control of the food/having to make it will help me recover as it’s a big part of my eating disorder. 
Any info will be appreciated thanks!!"
8794,1,Like there was this one Rhianna song that was huge with us there and now whenever it comes on I like get hit with this overwhelming wave of my loserness that I couldn't even pay people to care and failed at that too and ... I feel like maybe insurance cutting out and all the false starts Etc that happened after are all just more lowercase t trauma and I'm like stuck there in that time in that mental place ... like I have more experience and knowledge now but who I **am** got frozen then and I'm still there ... does that make any sense?! (And of course I'm still fat ...)
3052,1,Does anybody else have IBS or any similar gastro issues possibly linked to purging? I don’t purge much anymore but I’m very gassy and constantly bloated.
7203,1,"I mean, it's really nice to be ""out"" and open about my struggles. It takes a lot of anxiety off me to not have to lie about them, nor hide, compared to when I was younger, kept things in secret and stayed completely emotionally, mentally and to a certain degree, even physically isolated.
I love my friends and family, I really do. And I'm glad I can be a recovery advocate and speak about the particular experience of living and dealing with an ED, etc. But seriously, why do some people (it's not everyone, but sometimes it feel like it) feel they have any knowledge and/or right to tell me about how I gotta do things? Whether inpatient vs outpatient or some other treatment option that's in between. That I should try to be more spiritually active/connected (no, thanks, I appreciate their intentions but I'm just not a spiritual person). People even feel entitled to say they think I should be (or not be) on certain medications ??!!?. And also, God, no, I don't have any childhood trauma about my parents I gotta work on. And no, my cigarette addiction has nothing to do with my eating disorder, I swear!
It's cool to have people to talk to when I'm struggling (or acing it) and to have shoulders to cry on, and they can be good support when needed sometimes. I really value these things, I do. But please, why can't people just shut the fuck up??"

8072,1,"For the past few months I've been trying to free myself from an eating disorder I believed I'd never have to deal with again. For a year and a half from age 18-19 I was underweight. Most days I couldn't eat, and lacked hunger pangs, or that desire to eat.

Fast forward to now and I'm worried about how I've started to go down this route again. I feel guilty, I feel ashamed and weak, lacking will power... 

I am wanting to heal, I do want to treat myself better.
But I find it soo hard to approach food, eating it makes me sick... I feel emotionally triggered, and physically vile when I think of food. 

I dunno. Just need a space to get this out of me."

453,1,"Hi everyone - I just started a podcast (today!) where I plan on sharing my experience with eating disorders, mental health, and general life drama. I decided to start it after a few weeks of shame-filled and stressful binge eating that followed a year or so of intense calorie restriction. I felt there was a need for podcasts and other content that talk about eating disorder recovery from the perspective of someone GOING through it, rather than someone who has already recovered and is giving advice from the other side. I'm going to talk about the struggles I face, especially those of self-shaming and anxiety, along the road to recovery and the road to feeling ""good"" - hence the name, Waiting For Good. :) Please give it a listen [here]( and let me know what you think/if there are any topics you'd like me to discuss!

6502,1,Trying to go from 220 to 150
5614,1,I hate myself I look like a monster I am hideous and everyday it's gets harder and harder I don't want to be here anymore I hate saying that I feel ungrateful but I can't change how I feel. I am only putting up with it because I don't want to traumatize my family
7653,1,"I don't know if this is appropriate but I'm not sure where else to vent. I have struggled with disordered eating since about 14, not diagnosed. I've never been that worried about it because it always felt like a switch. The self hatred was always there but I could turn off the bad eating habits so I always felt safe. But about a year ago with everything happening in the world I fell into a deep depression and oddly enough for the first time in my life started working on NOT hating myself in an effort to lessen the heaviness that had sunk in.

I've gotten to the point where I do now love my body, even if only for what it is and what it does and not always how it looks (because that is a constantly changing and worthless value point). I have compassion and no longer tie my self worth to weighing less. Yet I can't stop losing weight now, food has no joy or taste. Before it almost had a kind of forbidden tabbo that would honestly help me get back into sustainable caloric intake. But I've been allowing myself to eat anything I want, for the first time I placed no restrictions of safe and unsafe food, I mentally made everything just fuel. How could learning to love my body as it is end up making my eating habits worse!!! It's so unfair, I've spent the better part of a miserable year stopping self harming and stopping the negative thoughts. I've changed my whole mentality through months of constant work and I'm rewarded with the inability to enjoy food since I took away the negativity.

Now all I see is a shrinking small body, I refused to see the smaller body as good or bad but for the first time in my life I'm scared. I've tried multiple times to 'flip the switch' back to healthy eating and it just won't stick. I'm tired, tired of constantly having to eat and re wire my thoughts. I'm tired of thinking about my body, I've been thinking about it every day for over a decade. I thought once I embraced self love my problems would be solved but somehow I made it worse.

Now I don't know what to do, I refuse to go back to the self hatred of before unless it's a last resort, but how can THAT be the better answer. I want to start running and working out again but I can't risk losing more weight. I feel lied to, I'm finally doing everything right and NOW I can't stop losing weight! Back when I would have given the world to lose a few pounds I couldn't to save my life and now I can't manage maintaining. I just want a normal life where I don't think about my body every goddamned second. I got exactly what I wanted so bad when I was younger but i don't want any part of it now. I'm so tired."
8560,1,"Almost a year ago to the day I posted about being a heavier girl with an ED and went on about how much I hated myself while I also posted a picture.

I realize this can be extremely triggering to others and I was definitely seeking validation, so that I could stop the self loathing.

I apologize if I upset or triggered anyone by it, and I realize my need to seek validation can hurt others.

While I never got any backlash for it, the comments were archived and I hid the post.

Again, I'm sorry for seeming insensitive and I'm continuing to learn and grow <3"
6011,1,"There's posts about that almost daily. And I get it, it's rough to look a way that you don't want to. I don't want to diminish anyone else's problems.

But is it bad to say I'm jealous of that one?

I WISH I was even somewhat masculine. I want broad shoulders, the ability to get at least a little muscle, a good jawline, a little more height, whatever it is. I don't have enough attractive features, and on a guy, that's a death sentence for most fun things in life."
4875,1,"(tw: mention of purg!ng) 

stuck in the lovely old binge restrict cycle again & im determined too break out of this quicker than last time. i dont even think i feel that much guilt for what i ate tonight after restricting in the day, just uncomfortable and automatically going back too planning my restriction. but i dont want too do that because ik ill just 'binge' tomorrow again. 

I feel disgusting & so full but i didn't really eat *that* much. i don't feel much food guilt but i feel guilty for not feeling guilt if that makes sense. ironic isnt it 

is there any benefits at all to eating more than your used to or more than you probably need. ive been trying to stop purg!ng for about three days and already failed twice :/  idk. never ending ugh."
857,1,"I thought I was doing okay before the holidays of 2020. I could easily walk past a snack without shoving it in my mouth. Bam! The holidays show up and by the 3rd of November I'm accidentally on my 3rd Christmas pie. I'm on the 4th of January and it would seem I have put on 12 pounds. I am ever closer to the 80kg mark.

4671,1,"Is it that you fully black out for a long time or do you just get really dizzy and have to lay down? I’ve heard that it’s a common symptom but I’ve never fully blacked out before. Sometimes it feels like I’m detached from reality and I’m swaying back and forth when I’m standing in one place. I also lose my vision briefly when I stand up. I’ve felt dizzy to the point where I feel like I can’t breathe and am going to collapse, having to lean against a wall, but never lost consciousness altogether. Maybe I’ve come close; I don’t know. I would just like to know so I know what to watch out for, and I’m not really sure what exactly the definition of ‘faint’ is. Thank you!"

2644,1,"I recently began purging after I mess up my restricting through binging. Normally I only highly restrict my food intake so I'm not as knowledgeable about what to expect after purging. 
So I binged and purged for two days in a row, but now I get pain in my stomach and chest when I exercise (especially during cardio) and I'm worried that I might have damaged my insides really badly. 
I wanted to know if that's something to be expected. Any help would be sincerely appreciated."
4965,1,"This morning I woke up and was punched in the face by the reality of my living. To go on like that was pure depression and bleak and I didn’t deserve it. For the first time in *months* I had three full meals and I’m not tired, my body has enough energy to keep me warm, and I’m not starving! Just a Little win but the first step to my recovery."
2031,1,"Hows everyone’s week been? I know a lot of people are probably stressed about Valentine’s Day. Share any achievements, goals, events, the interesting the mundane. Whatever you feel like. This is a safe space to just say what’s been going on with you eating disorder related or otherwise."
4598,1,"I tried to recover, I really did… but the emotional pain is getting so big and no one takes me seriously. When I was underweight I had a psych, went to school, my family cared about me and now I feel completely lonely, my boyfriend met me when I was already eating again so he is struggling to understand. I just want to give up, I miss the feeling - and I’m sure you all know what I’m talking about. I can’t do this anymore, tried to recover so many times but no one cares and I sure dont anymore. I just needed to rant, sorry"
5439,1,"I absolutely hate taking photos, I’ve avoided them like the plague but now I have none. I hate having to facetime people and knowing they see my face and I have to try to avoid staring at the small box in the corner. I tell people I’m photo shy and haven’t taken any recent photos, but it makes anything online almost impossible. I look sketchy online, it’s not normal and the real explanation is far worse. 

I recently met a guy I like and he wants photos, I tried my absolute best to take some today, I got 2 I liked but I stared at them too much and now they look deformed. I even re did my makeup twice to see if that would help, it didn’t. I feel even worse in makeup for some reason, I feel like an impostor and no amount of touching up does any good to my face. 

I’m sick of it. I look in the mirror sometimes and think I look okay, then I take a photo and I look completely different, the facetime video is 10 times worse. I can’t tell which one I actually look like. I can’t trust my own eyes and it sucks. I feel hideous and gross. 

worst part is I have to take a new drivers license photo soon and I’m absolutely dreading it. 
I hate photos. I hate my face. Its so hard to accept the fact i’ll never think i’m pretty and it makes me so anxious."
598,1,"I did amazing last week. Sunday is my first day off and last Sunday I stayed up after my spouse went to bed and I had been drinking but food wise doing well for the day. Then I just straight went to town and blindly ate 3k+ calories in less than an hour. Obviously that’s nothing and one day. Whatever. 

But the next day since I screwed up the night before and felt terrible, I told myself, “Screw it” and binged the entire Monday to enjoy the dopamine and counteract how bad I felt. Then. Tuesday did the same.

Did a hard reset the following two days. Fasted. I know that’s not recommended. But since then I haven’t binged or anything and ate according to what I’ve planned for myself. Even today I’m drinking but eating reasonable. That’s a win. 

I’m hoping I can make it to Tuesday to be a full week binge free. That’ll make it months since I’ve gone a week without binging. 

But for today, I’m stoked. Trying to do this day by day instead of get discouraged by the time it’ll take me to reach my goal."
2570,1,I have always struggled with my weight. I use to be skinny and al of a sudden I pile of weight. After breaking up with a long term boyfriend (6 years) I started purging. I’m 6 months down the line and I don’t know what worse. The same of purveying after eating and then stepping straight on the scales to make sure I’ve not put anything on or being proud I haven’t purged in a few days and realising thats because I haven’t eaten anything to purge. Am I the only one that stuck in this roundabout
5641,1,"I have nothing to offer. No extraordinary talent, no amazing social personality, no charm, and most certainly not intelligence. I scored awfully on a math quiz today compared to everyone and my self esteem feels like it just plunged lower. I'm worthless, just another in a sea of faces. I have nothing to offer to this world except my stupid creative writing projects that are useless in the real world and maybe, just maybe, looks. Looks are the only thing that keep me sustained and from falling over the edge. I want to be pretty, not because of vanity or privilege, but because for once in my life I don't want to feel replaceable and unworthy of everything"
2118,1,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with the Medical Center for Eating Disorders in Houston. I scheduled my assessment with them due to virtually no specialists nearby and I’ve been having a lot of concerning medical symptoms.

1932,1,"Just for some context I am writing this on my bathroom floor surrounded by vomit, it's everywhere on me on the floor on the walls even some in the toilet. In my bedroom there are about a million wrappers from binge food I bought the total cost of adding up to almost $110. I am exhausted and just want to go to sleep but I know i still have to clean up this mess. If you think that any eating disorder will help you or give you more control or fix whatever your coping for your wrong. They take  and take until there all that's left. If you're still in the early stages get out now. please take it from someone who is way to far in. there is nothing glorious about this. I wake up every day with food on my mind. I have spent 1000s of dollars on binge food only for it to end up in the toilet. And I am still no closer to solveing any of my problems. I have no more life I have lost interest in all of my hobbies and passions I basically have no more life. I have pushed all my friends away all because of this disorder. If you think I'm writing this to scare you, your Damm right this sucks and I would not want it to happen to anyone, get out while you still can. I guaranty you do not want this."
5401,1,"Most people say they feel better looking in the bathroom mirror, especially when they come out of the shower but for me it's the complete opposite. I almost get a mental breakdown everytime I'm in the bathroom, and especially after the shower with wet hair and being forced to look at my naked body.... it's the worst. But my face looks very weird, too, I don't know if it's the lighting or I actually look like that..."
6814,1,"Please help, I need ideas for recipes, food anything, I like to exercise and do strength training 4x a week, but I can't seem to control what I eat, I have tried calorie counting and it makes me very depressed. I'm aware of TDEE but I feel so helpless, I've gained so much of the weight I lost back, I was 93 kgs in 2019, got down to 88 kgs in 2020 and now I'm back up to 94 kgs in 2022. It's really hard maintaining a calorie deficit and I am so tired of cooking and eating healthy food, I really need help."
5814,1,"I deleted social media’s that I frequented which were Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok because they were making my body dysmorphia act up badly. I would constantly glance at myself in the Snapchat camera or compare myself to really pretty/skinny girls on insta and TikTok. I was either always ridiculing myself or I was staring at myself for long period of times.

But while I was trying to FaceTime my sister the other day of course I’m looking at myself while I wait for her to pick up the call. But I noticed I don’t recognize myself. And then I was taking photos just on my camera roll because in this small mirror I have I thought I didn’t look too bad. But then in those pictures, I just can’t recognize who she is. It’s like I’ve never seen her before and she’s kinda weird looking. 

And now that I’ve lost weight people say I’m pretty or they think I’m attractive. Even my ex boyfriend didn’t understand why I didn’t see myself as pretty. But when I looked in that reflection I look so weird. And so alien almost. I don’t get it.

Sometimes I get scared that I can’t recognize who is supposed to be me. I don’t know who she is and I feel almost disconnected to her. It’s as if she was just a completely different person that I don’t know staring back at me in my mirror."
8249,1,"Is it bad that my wife and I haven’t had sex yet even though we’ve been married since June 2021? 

There’s a lot that goes into this. We’re both virgins. I’ve had 4 relationships and a few sexual experiences that never led to sex due to my Christian beliefs. But I know how I get turned on, how to please myself and the way that I’ve coped with not having sex up until now was through masturbation whenever I get too horny from sleeping next to her and cuddling her every night.

For her, I’m her first boyfriend and now husband and she’s never had experience pleasuring herself before marrying me and doesn’t know a lot about how to turn herself on or allow someone to turn her on.

On top of this, we’re both black, but her mom raised her to only like people that aren’t black. Also, she’s a gym rat and is kind of OCD and is a control freak over food and compulsive exercise. She grew up really really insecure about her body due to some childhood trauma caused by her mother who has eating disorder tendencies and borderline personality disorder issues that she then passed on to my wife (mainly the eating disorder tendencies including a love/hate relationship with food, her body, and exercise).

She also doesn’t feel comfortable being touched near her vaginal area and tenses up whenever my hand gets close. We’ve tried letting her lead my hand, but the problem is we’re both busy a lot and when we get downtime and can cuddle and kiss, she usually doesn’t want to kiss, and likes to be on a specific schedule where she might decide to get on her computer and learn coding techniques after we eat and watch a movie/show and will sit on her computer while watching at times. If I ask to cuddle or show affection, she might sigh and say she’s not into it and just prefers to laugh at the movie with me or find new shows together. Which I also enjoy. 

She goes to bed early and wakes up super early to go to the gym. So the night routine would be about making sure she eats light and does whatever she needs to do so she can have energy to wake up at 4-5 am and go workout for 2 hours before coming back to see me off as I go to work. And sometimes that means not making out since that might cause her to have to stay up a little longer and end up falling asleep with me instead of staying on top of things so she can get up earlier. This process repeats daily except on Saturdays when I’m off and sometimes we don’t end up getting to kiss then either. So I tend not to ask to kiss much anymore and just cuddle her while we sleep at night since this is the only time we can actually cuddle.

She also had a hard time allowing me to compliment her and call her beautiful, pretty, sexy, or any flirtatious words, because she really doesn’t think so and is not used to being comfortable with her body as it is and is always trying to manipulate it and change it.

I usually don’t mind her habits, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t find her habits to be sometimes really annoying because it feels a lot like there’s another person in the relationship (her body and routine). It feels like it’s so important to her that she’s willing to focus really hard on it and not so much on building intimacy with me.

The last factor is that we got married super fast after dating for a year, no ceremony or nothing. And it felt rushed because we didn’t take our time with the engagement and felt pressured by our premarital counselor that was faith based instead of clinical based. So ever since then, that’s been a factor as well. 

These things combined have put strains in our communication and ability to have emotional intimacy because half the time I’m trying not to be viewed as an enemy for asking her honest questions about some of her habits in a nice way and encouraging her to go to therapy.

We’re getting better and have been in marriage counseling from a well practiced, empathetic therapist, but the lack of sex has been a concern for us. 

As for her habits, I’ve begun to not say much about it and just let the counselor lead conversations about that when needed and sometimes we get to discuss it by ourselves as a couple. 

And we recently talked about how we can start approaching sex again. My wife starts individual therapy at the end of the month so that I’m excited about and it gives me hope while I’m still happy with this marriage, but any tips on how I can cope with this as we basically wait for a chance to be closer?"
3577,1,"Hello,

Over the past about 5 years I've gained around about 30kg. I started gaining weight after I settled down with my husband, I noticed. However, my husband and I are currently long distance, and the last time I saw him he did comment on my weight. He wasn't horrible, just stated that he's noticed I've gained a bit and just to be careful for my health. I've never been a healthy weight, I've always been at least slightly overweight, so I didn't take offence to what he said because I am now obese, and I'm getting to the point where soon, I'm gonna be more than just slightly obese. 

I tend to do quite well during the day, but that's because I'm busy at work. I will have breakfast, which is cereal or toast and an apple and coffee. For my first break at work I usually have a cereal bar and an orange. My lunch is usually an instant noodle or left over food from dinner the night before. And on my third break I tend to have a little piece of chocolate. 

When I get home, I make tea. Usually rice with something or pasta, or some soup and bread. I do tend to have at least one kind of vegetable in every meal. However after tea, I can't stop myself. I'm just eating everything in sight. Biscuits, chocolate, crisps, yogurt. I tend to avoid the fruit, however. I'm not even that hungry, just eating for the sake of eating. I've started using my fitness Pal and have noticed I average eating about 3500 calories per day, double what my target is for me to lose weight. 

I know I maybe need something to keep me busy, but I get bored very quickly so if I take a hobby up, I quickly lose interest and don't do it anymore, or I can eat while doing it anyway. I told myself, today is gonna be the day I take better care of myself. But straight after having my tea, I ate 5 little chocolate bars, 2 packets of crisps and some caramel treats, and I still feel like I want to eat more. I feel disgusted at myself afterwards everytime I overeat like this, but I still do it every day. However I also tend to find, even when I do eat healthier, I feel hungrier. 

I'm seeing my husband in 10 days. I've gained more weight since I last saw him but I can't stop myself from eating, no matter how hard I try. I have no self control or willpower at all. Does anyone have any advice at how to start? Thank you for any help."
3252,1,I fought bulimia when I was 16. It stopped when I got pregnant. Im 29 now 3 kids later and found out my boyfriend is addicted to porn still incest porn.

I found purging made me feel somewhat better. Now that’s all I want to do. Im losing control. Kill me 
8233,1,"My 18 year old daughter (lives with her mom) was recently diagnosed.  She has gone through profound stressors in the past six months (a complicated tonsillectomy, slow death of her stepfather, first year of college) and hid this from her mother and I, mostly to protect her mother from additional stress while her husband succumbed to a terminal illness.  I knew she was losing weight but it was so gradual that I did not realize it was a problem until recently. 

Mom is sort of emotionally frazzled, understandably so, so I need to step up even more.  I would appreciate hearing from younger women how they would have liked their dads to support them.  What is helpful to hear?  What is not helpful to hear?  What should I do and not do?  I really appreciate your insight.

I've always struggled with food since a young age, like 7-8 but always thought it was normal after seeing it was how my mother ate as well, and poverty was a factor. 

My first true ""realization"" was in high school, when I dramatically lost weight and I confessed to my friends I might have an ED. One gave me the ""up-down look"" and blurted out that I was too fat to have an ED before stomping off and never speaking to me again. My second, was in my university courses and after battling severe nausea from the change in food and concerned roommates dragging me to meals which then caused what I call mechanical purging. I had a third relapse in senior year, the second most severe, and the most severe after I graduated and was living in my own looking after both my parents houses while my step dad was in hospital all the while I was working two jobs. 

I was diagnosed AN-B/P subtype in 2018 following a migraine hospitalization. I talked about it with my old psychiatrist, but he says ""it's not severe enough"" and we never talked about it in depth. I never seen him again. I've been waiting over a year for a new psychiatrist. 

I've never been inpatient. I've never been skelly, just UW. Hearing or seeing other people my height and seeing their weight or hearing their stories has been super triggering me lately and makes me wonder if I ever even had an ED or if it's just ""food problems with occasional purging and added bonus weight loss"". Idk fam, I just needed to rant. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for everyone who has battled and has had it far worse than I have, I can't even imagine what you went through. You are loved"
3610,1,"I'm getting jaw surgery on the 24th which means I'll have to go on a liquid diet for a while. I'm super scared because a lot of people have said that they binge really badly once theyre able to eat again. 

I've been doing really good this year, i only binge maybe once every 1 to 2 weeks. Just the thought of going back to bingeing everyday makes me want to throw up. I even binged today because of how anxious I was. (It was a pretty small binge, though, which im happy about)

Has anybody gone through this? Please comment if you have any advice."
3760,1,"This is mostly a vent idk I’m on mobile sorry for formatting 

I don’t really know what to do anymore tbh lol. I can’t stop. Even if I don’t binge like ridiculously bad I cannot for the life of me stay under budget anymore. 
I’ve been trying to be gentle with myself or whatever but it’s been months. 

I was doing super well for a while, lost 37lbs and then idk what happened. I just Couldn’t do it anymore. I have only gained 7lbs since this “relapse” I guess but that’s since October. Before long I’ll have undone literally all my progress. 

I am under care of a psych, I was previously taking Wellbutrin and it was doing absolute wonders for me with BED but it was also making me extremely anxious and irritable. I am trying to switch to strattera (I have adhd) but I have to fully wean my daughter from breastfeeding first. 

Things have been just so overwhelming though. I know part of it is because of the lack of medication but that really doesn’t make it suck less. I’m just disappointed I guess. I feel like crap again, I’m looking like crap again, and I don’t see this ever getting better. It’s truly embarrassing and I hate it."
3596,1,"My mom just told me I’m bigger and I’m feeling a bit triggered. I first started gaining weight in November 2020, so being fat is new to me. I’m coming from extreme fasting/restriction. I decided to finally stop when I stupidly gave blood and was also fasting one day. However after i started eating regularly and feeling better, I noticed I had an extreme anxiety about feeling hungry. So I would overeat daily whilst also not exercising or anything. I’m very obese coming from normal weight, and have decided to get a dietitian. 

Personally I believe my eating is a lot more consistent and ultimately, less. But because I’m still obese and don’t appear to be losing any weight (or even getting bigger) though my clothes feel the same for a few months now, is immediately losing weight a sign you’re better? I don’t check the scale. I’m honestly at a loss. Other people seem to stop bingeing/overeating and immediately lose weight. But I feel like my body is just sticking around at this weight and it’s either starve or nothing. 

Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice? Keep eating? How do you know how much is enough?"

Idk why I always do this I get drunk and then it’s like I have no control and just order the food of the world sometimes without even being that hungry and ruin all my progress for the week. I order for like a family of four and then proceed to eat it all. I am so embarrassed and so disheartened. I feel like shit both mentally and physically it sucks.

Ive been feeling like I haven’t been working out as I should be and this morning I woke up irritated because I feel I haven’t seen much progress body wise. 

Yet I got hungry after my class and decided to go get something to eat. I ordered a Chicken sandwich, fries, onion rings, a coke and a slice of ice cream pie. I ate it all and then this feeling of regret just took over…my stomach felt bloated and immediately went to force myself to puke. 

I thought I was past purging after I ate since I haven’t done it in about 5 months and now I feel like I’m spiraling down that path again."
1576,1,"I've been trying for months. I'm not getting proper help but I am doing some sessions and setting goals with a counsellor. The only thing I've managed to do is go from primarily anorexic behaviours to bulimic behaviours. I'm eating regularly and having 3 meals but I either b/p at the end of the day, or restrict as much as possible and exercise a ton. I can't do it, idk what to do. I really see no way out. I stop counting calories, I binge like crazy. I stop purging after binging, I'm purging TO binge. I stop binging, I start restricting. I haven't had a day free of behaviours since I started recovering. I've gained weight and I hate myself. I wanna go back to being ill but when I think about how I was, I was just so miserable. But I am miserable now too I'm telling myself that it's because of my body image and that if I work on that, I will manage it. But I really doubt it. If my body image gets better, I will miss the control. Please please tell me it is possible."

 i have told her that she triggers me on the regular but she doesn’t seem to see any issue with it, and i understand that i can’t expect her to recover straight away just to make things more comfortable for me. however, she often makes disgusting judgements on other peoples bodies and habits that i simply feel can’t be excused by an ed along with how vocal she makes her “successes”. 
anything would help at this point i’m really struggling to keep going with no one to talk to lmao"
7004,1,"F[28] Right before the pandemic, it took me two full years of consistent strength training, HIIT, and moderate diet to lose 16lbs.

Started at 141 and my lowest was 125 lbs.

I have gained it all back and more: weighed in today at 144lbs. I started crossfit last July, and no weight loss, sure gained some muscle mass (i go about 4-5x a week) but I genuinely look so big now. None of my clothes fit anymore and I’m dreading going up a size in clothing….again. I went from a small to a large.

I was trying to track my macros with calories at ~1,400 the last few weeks, but it wasn’t sustainable and kept binge eating when i could. Im going up to 1,600 cal this week (im on day 2) and seeing how it goes. So far so good…but im genuinley concerned that i will never lose enough body fat to feel comfortable in my skin while not feeling satiated after eating. I look in the mirror and am instantly disgusted and ashamed. I know I’m not “obese” but i genuinely hate my body and feel that way internally.

Am i on the right track? I feel lost and honestly i am starting to feel depressed. Exercise was supposed to help with that but i just feel like im losing control."
55,1,"Ive had an ed since i was like 9, and i cant seem to fix it no matter how hard i try.  I cant see a therapist at the moment but i need help.  I have a binging starving cycle thing and it just keeps getting worse"
3346,1,"I am 35 years old and I have been overweight for most of my life. I've done the yo-yo dieting thing. The first time I lost a substantial amount of weight was when I was 16. I was very pleased with how I looked but the way people treated me was confusing. I have a mood disorder and at its worst, paranoia is a huge problem, so the extra eyes on me drove me mad, and I got really depressed. Also, I noticed boys would be really nice to me, then really mean after a while. I didn't understand at first, but it didn't take too long to click. I wrote in my online journal, ""I remember being happier when I was heavier."" And some asshole said something about me looking great now so I shouldn't feel bad. 

I gained and lost weight a lot through my life. Food was happiness and fun times. Something to look forward to. In 2019 I was at my heaviest. It was to the point where I needed to start thinking about taking medicine for hypertension. My husband gained a lot of weight while with me and he wanted to lose it. I half heartedly joined him. He started to lose weight and I wasn't as on board as him. I wanted to change because I was afraid it would hurt our marriage, kind of like two alcoholics with only one recovered. So I started to take things more seriously and was considering my diet more. I counted calories and they may have been a bit low to some people, but I wasn't starving myself and would indulge on special occasions. It felt amazing to be able to say no to food. 

The weight started dropping and pretty soon, I was doing it for myself. It was great to work at the same goal together. It made our marriage stronger and we were both more active and happy. I lost a substantial amount of weight and was at BMI healthy for the first time in over 15 years and a physical showed I was in great condition, particularly due to the exercising. 

Around the end of the year, I was having issues with my mood again. It was uncanny, I would just be crazy depressed for no reason. So I started eating again because I didn't care about anything. Later I realized that it was the weight loss that made me depressed: at that point, one of my medications was too much for my current body size, so taking those MG down made me feel a lot better. However, during that time of depression, I gained a decent amount. When I started to feel better, I was motivated to take the weight off that I gained. 

My mom always made me afraid of hunger. She acted like it was dire to make sure I ate even before I got hungry. I wanted to face my fears and I fasted for 2 days, just to see if I could do it. I did and I was proud of myself and went about a healthy diet. Eventually I was doing one meal a day and the calorie count started getting lower and lower. One day at work, they ordered my favorite pizza. I wanted it so bad and I ended up having two pieces. ""I really wish I hadn't done that...wait, I know what to do,"" and I made myself vomit. That's when it all started. 

It was freeing. I knew that it was bad for my body, but like someone just wanting to ""try"" heroin, I started to do it more and it became a habit. I wasn't awesome at it and eventually gave up when it became more and more difficult to get stuff up. I thought that would be a good time to tell my husband. 

He was really upset that I had been hiding something like that from him. He told me I need to get help or he would tell my family what's going on. I wasn't ready for that so I got a referral from my psychiatrist. 

The therapist I spoke to decided my needs were above her so she referred me to an ED specialist. My first session with her, she strongly suggested inpatient. I felt like she was overreacting, but her concern did make me take things more seriously and I had some bloodwork done. Everything was normal, so my therapist felt like I could do an outpatient program instead where I would go to the center mon-fri for a full day for a month. It's a hefty ask. I make the most money in my household. 

It's been a year since I started. I remember vomiting, then getting in the shower and saying, ""Maybe I do have an eating disorder, lol."" It took a while to click. 

This is so different from my mood disorder. It seems like how people with OCD describe their disease. They logically know their innate rituals do nothing to resolve their deep anxieties, but they simple cannot logic themselves out of the anxious thoughts that drive them to do their rituals. I am very familiar with anxiety, but this anxiety isn't accompanied by mood changes so it flies under the radar and simply becomes a normal thing. I know it's not, but I have to do it for some reason. 

It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm more focused on the purge aspect rather than the eating. Maybe my larger meals are a binge to others, but I don't see myself as binging most of the time. I do damage control with things I ""shouldn't have eaten"" or I vomit nearly everything in an attempt to lose weight. It's not the most effecient way, but it's the easiest for me and it does work. 

This experience has taught me a lot about my relationship with food. I can eat a standard amount, vomit up as much as I can, and feel like I've had a normal day of eating. I can feel the symptoms of extreme hunger, but it's fine because I'm mentally satisfied. I don't eat to live, I live to eat. 

I've gone back to purging being an everyday thing, sometimes twice or more. I had gotten more efficient at it, so it's become easier, and absolutely normal. I function normally and I'm very bubbly, so no one suspects anything. I've cried about it a few times, but it mostly has the same energy of me needing to go on a diet to lose weight. I reaaaallly shouldn't purge...maybe just a little. I'll stop this soon. 

And on that point, it was interesting to hear my therapist talk about what my diet could look like where I'm not obsessive about controlling it, but it not having control of me either. My response was exactly the same as hearing people give advice on how to lose weight. My brain just shuts off and it's just blah blah blah are you done yet? 

So that brings me to a couple days ago. I had the worst acid reflux of my life. I wondered if it was emergency worthy. I looked it up, pretty sure it was something I did to myself and sure enough... beforehand, I opted to keep my dinner down that night. Maybe that in conjunction with something I ate (maybe?) caused the problem. I took 10 tums which resolved the issue and I was able to go to sleep. 

But man, it hurt so bad. I was reading stories about people with bulimia having these symptoms for life even after recovery. This was my first major physical symptom. I knew it was coming. For God's sake, I make teeth for a living and I was actively attacking my enamel on the daily. I joke with myself that I could just make myself new teeth. Funny, but not funny at all. 

I'm afraid now...so I told my husband I had still been doing it. I've confessed this to him a couple other times and he was supportive since I was getting help. He is so oblivious though. He gets hyper focused on whatever he's doing and it can be difficult to get his attention, so I can purge very easily at home without having to worry about him finding out. 

But this time he said something along the lines of, ""I wanted to give you your space, but I gotta put my foot down on this. If this isn't resolved by the end of the year, I'm taking you somewhere. I don't want to lose you."" 

I felt a little numb then. I told him I agreed but also tried to excuse myself by saying it's probably not something I would die from, just really damage my body. I don't know how true that is. 

Later that night I woke up around 2 and he wasn't in bed as he tends to stay up late. Someone kindly linked me to this subreddit as I was asking if any older people were there. So I was perusing a bit and I flashed back to earlier. I was thinking about what he said. I remembered his eyes turning red and him tearing up...and him saying ""I wanted to give you space,"" touched me a lot. 

The worst part about this is lying to my husband. He puts so much trust in me that I don't deserve. I thought to myself, I wish I had hugged him and thanked him for caring so much. Then I remembered he was just downstairs so I decided to do it. I love him so much. Even if this doesn't kill me, that doesn't mean I won't lose him. 

I'm looking into that long term treatment. I think I qualify for short term disability and my parents have money and they would probably be happy to financially support us as I'm taking these measures. 

The acid reflux scared me, but I know myself too well. I'll take a break for a while and then just get back to it. Little by little those physical symptoms will just become a part of my life. I was worried about drifting apart from my husband if I didn't join him in losing weight. Now the obsession with losing weight threatens our marriage. 

If you read any bit of this long, self indulgent novel, thank you so much. I very rarely am ever comfortable talking about it with people close to me."
6441,1,But I do have a question. If you have like a cheat day like full on whole chocolate bar(bar equaled 460 cal but I had some of it yesterday so it equaled out to 331) and some wonder works chocolate cereal(150 cal) and some almond milk(30 cal) can I still continue to lose weight even if I eat unhealthy in a calorie deficit (1290)-? (Also I will be eating more soon but that just what I have had so far I promise I’m not starving myself lol?
6113,1,Wondering if anyone could relate
5957,1,"Body dysmorphia is one aspect of a broader disorder I have, but it feels like everything in my life is revolved around what I look like, all the time.  At times I feel so incredibly vain, even though I’m only looking at myself in order to prove something I’ve yet to see.  I stare at my reflection hoping one day It’ll some how change for the better. I take pictures of myself on my phone not because I feel I look good, but because I want to make sure I’m not unacceptable. I always feel unacceptable anyway, but I save the picture to compare it to my future self and other past images.  This helps me feel at least a little more safe in what I look like, bc even if I’m ugly, at least it’s consistent and not getting worse. If anyone got a glimpse of my camera roll I would seem totally and utterly self obsessed. This is because I am,  but not in the way people commonly think. Most people when getting a peak at my photos make an understandable  judgment, which I can’t really say much to. Someone tells me I take a lot of selfies… What would I even say back? “all these pictures only exist because I want to make sure even if I’m horrid looking, at least I can have consistency in each pic I take” …? That doesn’t make it sound much better than just being labeled self obsessed. To make it worse, I have an unbearable fear that people will see pictures of me and think I’m trying too hard for how I look. The only thing keeping me from insanity feels like the consistency of my pictures, and mirror reflections. Soon enough I’ll grow older, and I won’t look the same- and then will come a whirlwind of the same “self obsessed” comments. This time though,  it can no longer be seen as “innocent insecurity”,  I’ll be older, more “mature” and I’ll be acting like a fantasy witch whose beauty is taken from her, except I never had any in the first place. 

In all honesty, I don’t expect comments- you can if you want- but I just really needed to witness myself say something outside of my own head. Sometimes I get stuck."

5786,1,"I've always despised my body which I feel looks far worse than ever. Now however I've started to notice how ugly my face is more so too.

I took some photos of myself which looked so awful. I hate my nose especially, I feel like it's so big. My side profile repulsed me, I never realised how bad it was. I feel like my face as a whole is hideous, I'm embarrassed to be even seen by anyone at times in all honesty.

Though I can't fully describe why, it just looks so bad to me. There's no beauty to behold. I see others who have what I don't too, they make me realise how hideous I am in comparison to them. I start to notice every flaw and imperfection more and more.

They seem perfect while I see myself as nothing more than a worthless living failure of creation who should just hide from the world. There is nothing to desire from me, I'm just a hideously gross disgusting joke."

7823,1,"Instead, here I am, at a certain BMI that I won't mention, and still hungry.

Grumble. So I guess at this point it's time to accept that I can't ever keep the weight off for good and just eat like a human being. But that sucks."
8304,1,"So, throughout my childhood I was able to maintain a healthy weight, but after a while I began to receive comments from a family member stating that I was getting fat and needed to lose weight, despite my doctors saying that I was the proper size for my age and that going a few pounds over was fine, as long as I keep it in control. 

Anyway, I tried letting it go and eventually I did. I was a pretty happy kid for the most part and almost always ate 3 meals a day and never skipped until I reached age 11 or 12. Around that time I became more self-conscious about how I looked, but l'm not exactly sure why...I really don't understand what caused it all, but one day I just got in my head and thought that I shouldn't eat anymore because I thought people would judge me for it. Like when l'd go to school, I'd just force myself to think that people were making fun of me for eating and so I stopped eating like I normally would to make all those thoughts go away. I just really dreaded eating in front of people. 

Instead of eating healthy meals, I would only eat potato chips or soda ONLY throughout the entire day and I did this for months until I noticed that my clothes were getting looser. Then I weighed myself one day and noticed that I had lost a significant amount of weight, but it didn't bother me. I actually like the fact that I was losing weight because it made my legs and waist look smaller and it became so bad to the point where my ribs began to show. 

Eventually, my significant weight loss began taking a toll on my health and I started feeling more dizzy, developed diaestive problems, had shortness of breath, and started to feel more weak whenever I tried doing normal activities.  I thought |  was fine though because I went to the doctor about it multiple times and they always told me that nothing was wrong with me, but it definitely feels like there's a problem because I've never had these problems before this started. 

 So here we are today…Over the years I have tried to fix my eating habits, but I don't think I'm doing very well with that.  I was so used to ignoring myself when I got hungry that now I forget to eat sometimes.  Like l'll eat maybe once or twice a day now but l'm not like how I used to be because usually l'll just eat one large meal and just skip for the rest of the day or just eat small portions of food just to say I've ate something.  It's really frustrating too because people just don't seem to understand that I'm trying and only see it as me being a difficult person, but the way I feel is more complex than they think.  

Anyway, I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder nor do I know if my situation qualifies as something of the sort, but if someone could offer me suggestions or advice on how I can fix myself, please do so.  Thanks!"
2772,1,"Sorry if this is a common question, but I could not find information in the FAQ.

5818,1,"I feel so lost with myself because I have no idea of who I even am. I don't know what I look like, I've been fortunate to have been told by my friends and whatnot that I'm pretty but I don't understand how they say that and yet I never see it. I've tried desperately to find confidence and like the way I look but I just don't. I don't know what they see but I just feel so ugly.

5283,1,"So like. I just turned 14. Reallly frustrated. Already got rid of most social media except this. 

&#x200B;

I found out that girls stop growing around this age and I’m only 5’3 (my asian family genetics have cursed me to be on the shorter end). Most of my friends, some even also asian are already 5’5-5’7. My mom keeps constantly comparing me, getting mad that I’m not taller than her yet (she’s 5’5). I get horrible sleep due to studying a lot at a rigorous school, and I’m a picky eater (I love veggies, but I hate meat). 

&#x200B;

Also, whilst all the other girls in my class are sporty and slim, I’m a little round and nerdy. It sucks. I’m 5’3 120 LBS and I feel like a pig around my 5’7 100 LBS friend with non-greasy long blonde hair and skinny legs.

&#x200B;

Oh yeah, another thing. My LEGS. They’re not fat, but I HATE having thicker legs, and my parents say it’s such a blessing because boys would love it. It’s always about being pretty for the boys! I WISH I was a guy, day and night I feel so out of place in myself. My face is dry and somehow also has never ending forehead acne and dark marks. My nose is ugly and wide, and even my mom says I should get surgery to make it look more European/white. I hate my skin, tan and riddled with eczema. All the white girls in my class are so pretty, like dolls. 

&#x200B;

I hate how I fit into pants. I’m an avid enjoyer of the Dark Academia subculture, but unfortunately I don’t fit well into many of the clothing. I wish I could fit into pants and not look dumpy or so curvy. Every shirt makes me look chubbier too. 

&#x200B;

As a pianist and artist, having small hands is embarrassing and inconvenient. My fingers are so chubby and stubby, and look like small sausages. My friends have really nice, long fingers and elegant hands. I have scars on my right hand from eczema and my left hand is always stained from pen ink or paint because I’m left handed.

&#x200B;

The only good thing about me is my hair, which then again I hate having long hair but I was told I’d look fat if I cut it. And it’s greasy no matter what.

&#x200B;

My brown eyes are really bad too. It’s so common, and nobody compliments me like they do with my green eyed friend. I have eyebags from lack of sleep and chronic internet usage. I wear small round sunglasses because my vision sucks and I’m really sensitive to light. Do you know how many times I got compared at school to Doc Ock from the Spiderman franchise (in a negative way)? Love the character tho!! HATE myself. Ack. I feel so gross. 

&#x200B;

I hate seeing the boys in my class too. They’re all really charming, and people only see me as mid or “cute”. It feels degrading. I don’t want to be the “short smol bean” irl. I wish I was a 5’10, brown haired, green eyes, pale and slim boy with a charming sense of humor. 

&#x200B;

I WISH. I WERE A MAN. THIS IS REALLY UNFAIR. THEY HAVE ALL THE GOOD FEATURES. Everything about being a girl physically is terrible.

1013,1,"Hello all! Last October, I had a major relapse into my food addiction, and this has been the second worse relapse in my entire life. Over the past 7 months, I have been gradually trying to break free from this, with a surprising amount of success. Lately, I've had minimal slip-ups and managed to lose 10lbs! Here are a few things that helped me specifically. I am not saying they help everyone, but they have massively helped me.

1. First of all, I realized that a big problem for me was being able to have easy access to buying whatever food I wanted at any time. I can't exactly shut down every restaurant or store in my area just for my sake, so I realized I needed to **restrict my access to my money**. I opened a saving's account and had the majority of my paycheck go immediately to it, out of sight, out of mind. I only had just what I needed go to my checking account, and I refused to open a credit card. This forced me to adhere to a strict budget without room for food I shouldn't be buying.

2. I decided to set one rule of thumb 'no buying food from restaurants.' Doing the above forced me to stick to this rule, since food from restaurants adds up quickly in costs. Due to the coronavirus, I haven't had to put much effort into avoiding restaurants.

3. I realized I can't trust myself to always make the right choices when it comes to buying food. Stepping into a store almost guarantees I'll walk out with at least 1 food I shouldn't be eating. Even with a list, glancing at a bag of chips for too long may do me in. Ordering groceries online is the best way to go about it for me. I have my 'list' already saved to my account so I don't even need to browse to add things to my cart. Just hit order and it's good to go.

4. I've formed a diet for myself based off of my dietary needs and what works best for my body. This includes excluding a great deal of foods, including *all* processed foods and sticking to a 95% keto diet, which might not work for everyone, but it's what I had to do. I am the type who must cut out all junk foods completely - I cannot do moderation. It may be different for you. This took me MONTHS to finally do. I had to cut out certain groups of food one group at a time until I finally was 100% within the bounds of this diet. This isn't to lose weight; it's to stay healthy and avoid another relapse.

Lastly, I wanna note that I did not work with a doctor, dietary expert, or therapist throughout any of this. I highly recommend doing so if you have the time and resources. I suppose I'm lucky in that I never became overweight as I always manage to fight my way out of a relapse before it gets to that point. However, being overweight doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy and being unhealthy doesn't necessarily mean overweight. Despite being 125lbs, I ended up with high cholesterol among other issues. Because of my autoimmune condition, food addiction could kill me if I don't fight to control it.

These are just some general tips that worked for me. Again, it's different for everyone, but I thought sharing my experiences might help a few people out there. Good luck everyone! :)"
7911,1,"This is going to sound so dumb, but damn did it irk me. I was having a conversation with a coworker today who got covid almost a year ago and lost her sense of smell. I was asking if her sense of taste was still with her and she said yes, but since her smell was gone she lost her appetite. She then went on about how she wasn’t eating as much bc of the loss of appetite and was worried that she might be on the path to an ED. She said her doctor explained to her that an ED for her most likely won’t be an issue and I agreed. I mistakenly replied “I think you’re ok bc with an ED you would choose not to eat” (disclaimer I am diagnosed with AN and am very well aware of the disease and how it affects my brain/body/etc). Because I replied in that way, I then had to hear a whole lesson from my coworker how ED isn’t a choice, but something that happens bc people can’t help it. 

I know my response to her wasn’t correct and hers is definitely is, but damn did it piss me off. Who is she to tell me what disease I HAVE? I know she doesn’t know I have an ED and I have no plans on telling her, but I can’t help but feel a type of way about the conversation. Especially because of how competitive ED mentality is, I wanted to shut her up and just say I had AN so she couldn’t “one-up” me in the convo, but also I was offended because it just set in the idea that I don’t look sick enough to have an ED. My brain is so messed up. 

Rant over, I know most likely people will find this uncalled for, but it happened and it’s how I’m decompressing."
291,1,"Hi, I’ll keep it short as possible. I’ve struggled with anorexia for about 3 years now and have recently wanted to recover I attempted to eat at meal times and snack and I did okay for a few weeks but then I noticed the physical change and a few meltdowns later & I’m worse off then before I tried to get better. The thought of recovery fills me with a paralyzing fear and uncomfortableness almost (similar to how it felt right before you threw a tantrum as a child, pure rage and frustration, etc). I feel like I lose all control of my mind and life if I’m not active in my ed. I was the “chubby” (as my peers would have said) kid and once I developed my ed I suddenly became so beautiful and everyone told me how good I looked. I don’t even look like myself anymore I look so empty and sad, I’m miserable and so irritable but the fear of gaining weight takes priority over all of that. It feels so ridiculous and I just feel so alone and lost about what to even do to possibly start getting better."

Horrible binge, says to self ""I'll fast for a day"", doesn't end up fasting, binges again, flips put on self for having a huge stomach. I'm ""skinny/ fat"".. all my fat is just bloating and fat in my stomach from these binges. I refuse to weigh myself this last month since the binges have been frequent and I haven't been exercising.

6905,1,"So im 155 cm at 50-52 kg. It’s been hard for me to go under 50 kg and I think I have reached a plateau.

Ive been eating 1200-1400 calories per day and doing jump rope 3x a week. For the rest, I work at a desk and do nothing.

1. My goal is to be 48 kg and change my body composition (aka lose fat). For that, i know that macros matter so I keep my protein at 80-120g per day. One thing I’m having a hard time with is carbs. I love eating mangoes and jackfruit and it can easily bring my carbs to 150-200 g per day. How different are the carbs from bread/pasta to the carbs in fruits in terms of body composition? Will it affect my body composition?

2. I really suck at strength training, will lowering my carbs and increasing my protein without exercise change my body composition? Or do i have no choice but to do strength exercise :("
2254,1,"so about three weeks ago, my gf and a close friend had an intervention sort of thing where they basically told me if i keep refusing recovery, they’re going to either leave or reach out for professional help. so i’ve been attempting to recover since then and it’s been absolute hell for me, it’s made me morbidly depressed and even more miserable than i was before. i wasn’t ready to recover yet and i’ve relapsed into a binge/fast cycle.

my gf has been dieting lately, and she also doesn’t really know much about disordered behavior and restricting. so i kind of figured she was rapidly losing weight healthily.

until yesterday, she was talking about her diet and just casually mentioned that she stays under 800 cals a day, she thought this was completely normal. this put me in shock, i had to tell her that what she’s doing is literally starving and is considered mid restricting. she was confused and told me she wasn’t losing any weight with a 1200-1650 intake, and thought that lowering it was normal. she doesn’t have an ED and isn’t obsessive about her diet or losing weight, she genuinely thought this was normal because it was working.

this of course triggered me into fucking oblivion, especially since i’m attempting recovery right now for her, and it’s been horrendously rough for me mentally. 

i feel guilty being so angry about it because i really do trust that she didn’t know what she was doing is unhealthy. but my disordered brain has made my thought process so toxic that i can’t help but get angry and frustrated that this happened while i’m recovering. idk what to do this is such a weird situation :/"

7215,1,"Hello all, I posted here some months ago saying I was able to 'eat regularly' for a week (iirc!) and that was a big deal for me. I wanted to update with good news :) 

Obviously there have been some ups and downs since then, but my weight has been stable for months now. And my therapist has deemed it suitable that we move on from specialised CBT for the ED, to DBT.

The DBT is apparently a natural progression and meant to reduce my vulnerability to ED relapse. As part of that we are doing a lot of ""chain analysis"" of problem behaviours (doesn't have to be ED related, but for example restricting) so I can stop any bad thoughts leading to maladaptive behaviours in its tracks.

I'm just sharing, hopefully this can help others see recovery is possible, even if I can't say I'm fully there yet. 

I have a long way to go and it was a lot of work getting here. I had to stop going on reddit tbh. Also, Disclaimer I had to first sort out my depression which compounded my ED, by fully confronting an interpersonal issue. Once that was out of the way I really felt more able to follow the regular eating and more motivated to succeed.

My therapist said that once I'm at a good place with the dbt and more stable, I can do ptsd therapy, again to reduce my vulnerability to relapse. So I'm looking forward to that :)"

I put on a bigger hoodie but I told my mom she really hurt me, she apologised and said she wouldn’t say that ever again. On Friday I got a meal plan for my Ed and I’m terrified. No one was saying I was skinny anymore so I thought great I’m “ obese “ now. I started crying and ignoring my parents. My mom started off on me and told me that my aunt ( I met her yesterday for the first time in 3 months ) asked her if I was sick because my hair was thin ( I’ve always had thick hair ) my legs were like “ match sticks “ and my face was gaunt.

6718,1,"Should I tell my mom about my recent binge episodes?

I’ve recently had these binge episodes, and I have the fear of gaining an unhealthy amount of weight and making these binges a regular habit. 

To summarize it quickly, I used to restrict how much food I ate and I worked out excessively. Ever since December however, I’ve been slowly recovering. However recently at school, I’ve used my money to buy pop tarts and cookies from the vending machine. It’s been a while since I let myself have sweets again and I just couldn’t contain myself. 

It tasted so good and I’ve had like four pop tarts a day. I think I’m beginning to grow an unhealthy addiction to sweets once again. To make matters worse, I’ve also been trying different types of sweets and eating a whole lot of chocolate bars. 

Luckily, my weight is still at a healthy level due to all the restricting I’ve done. But if I continue at this rate, I’m going to be unhealthy once again and be in the same predicament that started my restricting in the first place. 

I feel like I should tell my mother about what I’ve been doing and hopefully get her advice and help. But part of me still is addicted to the sweets and food.

I know it’s in my best interest to tell her so that I don’t continue these unhealthy habits, but at the same time, the sweets are so fucking good. I’m trying to workout enough to compensate for the calories but I know it’s only a matter of time before my body gives out and I’ll put myself in extreme pain.

What should I do?"

With the amount of stomach pain I’ve endured from all the excess oil, diary and gluten that’s in everything - there’s no way I haven’t. I want to cry. I knew this would happen, and I told myself before I came on this trip that whatever weight I do gain, I can lose it again but healthily. It was comforting at first and helped me engage in normal meals with my family and to indulge in dessert which I never do. I feel like I’ve gone off the deep end cause it’s so different than what I’m use to. My mom has made so many triggering comments about what I have been eating. I’m awake in my cabin unable to sleep and all I can do is daydream about restricting again once I get back home. I find comfort in that.

I eat a very balanced diet, but have found myself on a number of occasions pushing through fullness (not really uncomfortable or painful) and finishing a meal. Obviously this is fine and normal sometimes but it's scaring me how often it's becoming. Is this a problem? Im.afraid of gaining an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy."
9542,0,I’m really stuck. I’ve been trying to do IE for months I want to say since maybe January and I keep coming back to it but I’ve been really focused since March. My cues for hunger and fullness are totally messed up and I’m only seventeen. I have a bad habit of overeating. almost daily or just eating to eat and often times this leaves me feeling miserable and I know most people say that if you’re overeating than you’re restricting in some way but I don’t know how? I mean sure I have thoughts about food but it’s unrealistic for me to go out and get everything I think about I just start eating and I get the cue that I’m full but it’s like leaving something on my plate is taboo even though my parents never forced that on me and I have food in my house so nothing is limited which makes it even harder for me to understand why I keep putting myself through this same cycle. I know the food is there I see it so why do I keep eating when I’m full? As far as my hunger I don’t know if I would have such a problem recognizing it as much as I gave waiting for it if that makes sense? I know a lot of people say that thinking if food is a sign of hunger but I don’t think that’s reliable for me because I do get full quickly and easily even if my stomach is growling I guess I just want to rush the feeling so I can eat. I recently brought it up to my therapist and she recommended a food journal but I’m not sure what to write for it to be helpful some people says on a previous post of mine this could be harmful but I’m not really restrictive with my food intake. I read some of the book but it didn’t seem helpful to me maybe because of my age I just felt like it was more so chronic dieters which for me isn’t really the case I had one summer of calorie counting and a chronic dieter step mom. I’m thinking maybe I should set up meal times I tried this b4 but I didn’t do it for long but maybe it’ll help? Sorry for the long post but I would like input from real people :)

Hi everyone,

I hope this is allowed here.

I’ve been reading a lot about intuitive eating for a few weeks now and after talking to my therapist, yesterday I did a full day of eating intuitively. For me, this meant throwing out all my “rules” around food and as a result I ate breakfast at work for the first time, well, ever, and ate lunch an hour earlier than I usually do. Then, around midnight for some reason I was starving in bed so I got up and ate a snack—also something I would never have allowed myself in the past!

I have a history with EDs, however, and I just read a post on r/fatlogic about intuitive eating that seriously scared me. The person said that in 6 months of IE, they gained 22lbs. 

I feel myself backing out of this journey and could really just use some extra encouragement. I know weight gain isn’t supposed to matter, but if I gained 22lbs I feel I would have a major problem on my hands and would spiral even more. Have a lot of people gained weight after starting IE?"

I still have a long way to go, but it’s a bit surreal, as I haven’t been at a weight this low in 11 years. I also bought some new clothes and have gone down a shirt size and down two sizes in my jeans. My next goal is 100 lbs lost, so I probably won’t make a post next month, but when I hit that.

I used to be a good student throughout my high schools, and now I am preparing for an entrance exam. Now I whenever I goto study, my brain kept asking me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? It asks me really terrible questions, Why I have to Study ? What is my motivation ? And the anxiety created by not studying at all is haunting me. I literally wakes up multiple times in night. And felt really bad about it, that my exam is near and haven't studied but when I goto study my brain again bombard with me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? I really cannot describe the problem. It just doesn't let me focus on my study. When I search for my purpose ? I got blank answer which really demotivates me just pushing me back in this cycle. How can I help myself out of this problem ? What my purpose can be ? Or knowing that purpose really important enough ? Or it is just my brain trying to circumvent the hardships of preparation. 

I am so deeply entrenched in this never ending depression, that now I cannot even decide what is good or bad ? 

Please take some time , as It can help someone like me. I also tries hard to remember from my past, how I used to perform so good earlier but I never get the answer. 


My questions are 
1. What is my purpose can be ?
2. Or knowing that purpose that the self help books and other claims is just a stupid concept and knowing it will not create any difference ?
3. Should I just keep myself busy ? How can I stop my brain or ignore it questions ?

It's been going well, I'm gaining weight, I'm getting the body I want, my mental health was good up until this week and I'm generally just getting better.

And I still am at peace with food, but also having a bit of a concern. Since last Monday, I feel like I could eat all day. I am never really satiated, even though I eat quite a lot of food. I eat whenever I am hungry, I don't try to surpress my hunger or delay eating. But I just keep wanting more.

9734,0,"During lockdown and this whole pandemic obviously I’ve spent a lot of time at home... making me become consciously aware of what I’m eating everyday and disgusted in myself for it too..

Over the past 6 months it has been a battle, let me tell you. So I’ve always struggled with my eating habits anyway, but I’ve always just subconsciously eaten whatever right? At the start of lockdown like everyone else I was like ‘okay it’s time to sort my weight out and hit those goals’ 6 months later and I am the embodiment of a couch potato and I’ve put on weight. How?

Well, I was trying to loose weight which in turn made me very conscious of what I was eating, trying diets, trying to eat healthy, I had fallen into the vicious cycle of binge eating.. so in my head if I had failed my diet one day I thought ‘fuck it might aswell eat bad for the rest of the day’ (btw ‘failing’ my diet was because I had a piece of bread and wasn’t carb free...!!!) so because I ‘failed’ I’d order takeaway.. lots of takeaways.. and go to the store buy so much shit and just eat it. Now. After the first day of this it would last for about 2 weeks. Everyday. Takeaway, junk food, fizzy pop. I don’t even want to think about what I consumed because ew. But THEN I’ve become addicted... like I genuinely can’t stop ordering food and I’ve fallen into a vicious cycle that I don’t know how to get out of..

I can honestly say it is the biggest challenge to go one day without a takeaway and junk food.. I don’t cook anymore, in my head if I’m going to eat toast which in the diet world is considered bad I might aswell just have an XXL pizza right? 

Honestly the diet community has fucked my eating habits up so bad, so many rules and different things to follow it’s driven me crazy and I’ve picked up the worst eating habits.

Before I could eat toast with butter without feeling guilty and feel like I’ve failed so I may aswell have a takeout..

I’ve been trying to get out of this cycle but now that I see every food that isn’t a salad as ‘bad’ it’s difficult. Honestly, reading into weight loss was the worst thing I ever did because there are SO many ideas and theories out there and SO many different diets to follow that it’s just sent me into a spiral and I’ve ended up putting on weight.

I miss the mindset I used to have, I used to just eat when I was hungry, not eat late at night and not have this guilt placed into my brain about certain foods because of diet culture..."

It has taken me almost 10 years of gaining/losing to figure this out!! I used to think I was doomed because I always thought you can’t maintain a deficit (true) but once you start eating normally then you’ll just automatically gain it all back (which is also true if you don’t change habits while in the deficit). I used to think I was just dealt bad genetics, I was the fat kid all my life. But when I really think about it, I was not active as a kid and ate way too much. Ultimately it’s calories in/calories out, I do believe food quality matters too however I gained weight eating the most high  quality nutrient dense food because I was eating too many calories for my expenditure. Science lol. I feel dumb it took me this long to realize. Now I want to focus on building muscle and changing body composition while in a very minimum surplus like 100 calories over a day until I’m satisfied with the muscle I’ve built and then go back to maintaining. And I realize how freaking EASY it is to overeat especially garbage food! And how you really cannot exercise it off, it would take hours everyday to do that. I get it now.

We have Jack and we have Frank

Jack and frank are both asked to play a game. However, they are being investigated and the rules for the both of them are a bit different.

Jack whenever he loses a level, he loses 5 points out of a total 200 points

Frank doesn’t even know points exist and just plays.

Now who do we think would complete more levels and be more successful at the game

I thought Jack would, since seeing his points go down after every turn, he’s going to force himself to get better so he won’t lose more points.

But actually, I was wrong

The guy who didn’t lose any points actually did better.

This example comes from Mark Rober’s Ted talk “The Super Mario Effect”

If we put ourselves in the place of each guy during the game, we could picture Jack getting anxious and frustrated after every failure. He’s seeing his score go down and every time he looks towards it, he remembers all his past failures. And when they happen again or he fails multiple times on the same level, he beats himself up more for it.

Then we look at Frank. He doesn’t have this big bright red score making the same annoying sound effects after he loses, in fact he doesn’t even see it as a failure.

Maybe Frank fell off a cliff but all he’s doing is saying ok, I got to remember not to do that next time. He doesn’t recognise it as a failure but a piece of info that he has gathered that could help him.

I watched this video and I was thinking to myself but what if I could just not fail. Won’t that be better. I beat the system that way no matter what world I’m in, right?

Mark Rober was like “Hmmm idk about that”

Video games are very similar to life, we complete a few tasks it could be putting a ball at the back of a goal or defeating an evil dinosaur.

In Mario if there were no obstacles, and the pathway was clear and straight, who would play that? it would be boring.

But add in some monsters, a few things to climb and some puzzles and you got yourself a game that ppl are willing to pay money to play.

Without failures and a challenge, a goal doesn’t feel exciting and worthwhile to pursue.

So basically, we have to accept failure but not let it overwhelm us, once we look at it as a learning experience and an obstacle that we will overcome, things will work out in your favour."

It stems from my job - 50 to 100 emails a day, always on the clock, company-wide group chat, phone calls at any hour, deadlines, social media dings, questions and chatter from colleagues, on and on.

From there it's my social network - my friends, and my family. These are people that I love and want in my life, but my dad is retired and I am his world so he texts me all throughout the day. Certain higher maintenance friends guilt me into feeling I have wronged them by being so busy.

The list continues but I won't bore you.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I get overwhelmed by the sheer level of demand put on me by external forces, and then that overwhelm turns into resentment.

I resent every time my boss emails me, I resent every time my dad texts me, I resent every time my beloved dog fights for my attention. Considering these are all things I'm very grateful for, that initial pang of resentment is pretty fucked up.

They have some limited free content, and it’s a $9.99/month subscription to access the rest. I tried out one of the free classes today and am not sure if I enjoyed it enough to spring for a membership, but I’ll try a couple more and thought that others here might like to as well! It’s refreshing to see a fitness app that isn’t focused on calorie burning or tracking every step. 

If anyone else has recommendations for fitness apps or YouTube channels that focus on joyful movement, please post them!"

I've also been looking a lot into anti diet and intuitive eating and have been more relaxed over the past week or so about my eating (e.g: having ice cream a couple of times a week, enjoying an alcohol free beer  once or twice a week too, a bag of crisps at lunch alongside my sandwich)

Today I did an hour of pilates. I was planning on enjoying a beer after dinner but immediately thought 'well that would be ruining my workout/make me less fit etc ' it's just so hard to break out of this health being synonymous with not enjoying certain things? 

Fyi: alcohol free beer because I no longer drink!"

I logged everything I eat on MyFitnessPal and I am starting a diet with a dietitian to see what I might be doing wrong in what I think I do right.

Is this a normal part of beginning IE? Anyone have experience dealing with this?"
10092,0,"Edit: I thought I typed ""underestimates"" in the title. 

Yesterday, I was reading a world atlas from 2007. There were statistics in the back, and I noticed that Eritreans consumed on average 1,590 kcal a day and Ethiopians consumed 1,950 kcal a day. I just looked up data right now, and even the hungriest countries consume ""too many"" calories according to diet culture (I'm fully aware that they don't live their lives the same way Americans do but that isn't the point). 

I was looking at Chocolate Covered Katie's blog (I like her recipes even though her blog comes across as diet-y sometimes), and she made some posts about what she eats in a day. She consumes around 2,900-3,000 calories in a day (she includes calorie counts at the bottom).  Some of the comments were like, ""If you consume that many calories, how are you not obese?"" I think that people don't understand that some women actually need that in order to function properly. 

During the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, they cut the caloric intake of these men down to 1,560, and yet you see grown men on 1,500 calorie diets. I really don't think that that's enough for them. I follow my body's natural hunger and fullness cues, and I think I consume more than 1,500 kcal on most days and I'm a five foot tall woman (I don't count calories and so I wouldn't know for sure). 

Some people might say things like ""yeah well maybe some people can consume that many calories because they have quicker metabolisms."" The thing is that caloric restriction slows down your metabolism, and people are supposed to be at different body weights. 

And pro-diet people always talk about how in Japan they're all super healthy because they ""eat so little,"" but the average daily caloric intake of a Japanese person over one year old was 1,930 in 2002. And that mean average includes toddlers who are supposed to eat around 1,200 a day. And people talk about how Americans ""eat too much,"" but  European countries don't consume much less than we do. Both the healthiest and hungriest countries consume excess calories according to diet culture. 

I have a co-worker who is trying to lose weight,  and yet she started off with a BMI of 21.9. She was likely at her body's natural set point, and yet she was brainwashed by the media into believing that she needs to be super thin and is now ruining her metabolism. The average woman even in the hungriest countries is ""fat"" by modeling standards and probably doesn't have flat abs. I once had some idiot tell me that a woman who is my height should be weighing 90 pounds and that I'm fat, but most women here on planet Earth are ""fat"" if you think that a woman's BMI should be 17.6 (which is actually officially considered ""underweight""). 

Sorry if this was too long, but it is truly upsetting that starvation is the norm in diet culture. And all it's doing is ruining people's mental health, causing deaths and contributing even more to the so called ""obesity epidemic."" Starvation doesn't help one lose weight long term. 

(Please please don't make comments like ""I eat 900 calories a day and I'm perfectly fine"" and ""some people have slower metabolisms."")"

9851,0,"Hi all,

I have had some negative feelings about my weight and body so I wanted to reach out for support. 

I am not sure how much of my background is relevant, but I will try to sum it up. I am a middle aged mom now. I intentionally lost a significant amount of weight in my 20s due to dieting and exercising in an obsessive way. Nothing ""diagnostic"" for ED but like fully bought into diet culture and a lot of anxiety about weight and body. I slowly came back to a more natural way of eating as I entered my 30s and was able to enjoy food more and not see exercise compulsively. I was in a good place with my self image and my relaxed attitude with food until I got pregnant. My pregnancy was great, but afterwards I had severe PPD requiring hospitalization and serious psych meds. The meds saved my life, but also caused a lot of weight gain. It's been hard for me to sort out how much of the weight gain was hormonal, postpartum, stress, medication but anyhow they all added up to significant weight gain. I will not use any numbers, but I am far above my previous highest weight before I started dieting in my 20s.

I think because I am older now, I have been able to be more kind to myself and not worry so much about my weight and appearance. But of course, the thoughts are still there. A lot. I had made peace (for the most part) with never losing any of the weight and I am trying to instill a healthy relationship and attitude with weight with my child. My weight has been pretty stable for a few years, ever since I weaned off one of my medications. 

But then came quarantine. 

At first, I was kind of smug about the fact that I wasn't worried about gaining weight when I saw other people panicking about it. But then a few pounds came on and I was not so smug anymore. I am kind of freaking out. My clothes don't fit quite the same. I feel physically heavier going up and down stairs. I am getting heartburn. My eating habits haven't really changed, and I exercise daily (not in a punishing way, just a workout that makes me feel physically and mentally great), but of course I am mostly homebound, so I am sure I am getting deconditioned. Today I plan to wear a swimsuit and yeah . . . I'm not feeling great about that. But I also don't want to have my kid seeing me feel ashamed of my body. But like . . . it's not just appearance at this point. I don't like heartburn. I don't like feeling like I can't walk as fast and as hard as I want to. I want to keep up with my kid. I just can't bear the thought of gaining any more weight. 

I don't even know what I am looking for here. Maybe just some empathy. Thanks all!"

I have read the IE book. I have a history of different eating disorders since 2013, and currently struggling with bulimic tendencies. So I have a lot of subconscious food rules that I've developed over the course of 8 years.

This might be a really obvious realisation; in fact, I think it is a very trivial realisation for most people. 

Whenever I have a pack of things, or bake a batch of things that can be counted in numbers (like cookies, pieces of brownies, or candies in a bag with different colours) I always feel the need to eat a complete group of them (eg: if I was eating Haribos, I would them in sets - one set including a piece of gummy in each colour). This applies to leaving foods uneaten as well: I would need to leave cookies in pairs, or have an even number or one of each variety (of flavours/colours) so that I can also eat it correctly the next time. It sounds a bit crazy, but it was just a compulsion that I would always feel. As far as I know I don't have ADHD or OCD, or any diagnosed mental disorder/illness... so I think I'm just very particular about having the ""perfect set"" to eat if I leave any leftovers.

Yesterday, I fried some sesame balls filled with red bean filling (delicious), and there were 10 of them. I ate 2 - an even number - and wanted a third, but didn't want to leave behind seven balls. So, I decided not to eat a third. A few hours later, I really wanted another ball, so convinced myself that I could eat another one, and would not indulge my compulsion to eat a fourth so that I could leave behind an even number. So, I ate a third ball and resisted the fourth. 

It sounds so trivial but it was such a huge thing for me. I woke up this morning and had one sesame ball with my coffee, and didn't feel a compulsion to check to see if there were still an even number of sesame balls left for later. I guess I am starting to realise that my own satiation and cravings are justification enough to eat, and that I don't have to follow these strange rules I have set for myself."

I’ve realized through this process, though, that I’ve spent so much of my life trying NOT to eat that I have no idea how to eat enough to nourish myself. 

So I’m wondering, if anybody might have recommendations for books that just teach me a bit about nutrition — how to get vitamins and minerals, and what they do, and things I can make that fuel me up? 

I can’t find anything that doesn’t throw in restriction and things not to eat. I don’t want to read about all that for obvious reasons. Nobody  will ever again be allowed to take away the joy of baking for me

12664,0,"Affirmations have a very positive reputation in this community which is baffling to me because yes they do make a superficial improvements but the price for this is just too much.

What affirmations basically do is that you enforce something which is not inherently real through repetition and it's basically hypnotizing yourself or brainwashing yourself. I believe if you have issues with self worth you need to understand why those issues are there and observe how your mind works, what triggeres those patterns etc. The mind is a very sensitive thing and just raw dogging your way into feeling worthy is never gonna work and is dysfunctional and abnormal it's like when you see the victims of a cult that believe in some very irrational things because they were being told what to believe everyday from the moment they wake up until they sleep. A mind that is being constantly forced to think a certain way would lose it's sensitivity to life, joy and creativity. Point is if your mental foundations are shaky and are the result of deep burried psychological issues from childhood to whatever age you're in rightnow the wisest decision would be to adresse those issue at their roots not deluding yourself into believing otherwise. As this is a self improvement community it goes against everything this stands for because you've limited yourself into a psychological box in which you think and believe you're worthy but in reality what dictates almost of 95% of the way we think, feel and act is unconscious and it just screams worthlessness so what you believe and what you feel/do  are in opposition so you've just created for yourself another source of inward resistance which breeds conflict, rigidity and lack of creativity. If you want to to really dive deep in this journey of improving one's self, understanding your problems and basically go through the biggest life transformation possible then being direct and not lying to yourself is crucial. To conclude instead of affirmations learn how to observe the workings of your mind throughout the day and the more you understand about yourself the deeper you'll reach.

Mindfulness is key."

11594,0,"Due to gastroparesis I have almost zero hunger cues and often feel “full” after a few bites. Once I eat breakfast I often won’t feel hungry for the whole day; some days I’ll be so bloated after a meal that I’ll feel sick while eating the next meal. In order to maintain my weight I count calories, and even though I KNOW I’m eating the amount I need I often end the day so full I feel like I’ve binged. I’m constantly eating past “fullness” and although I know I’m not overeating it often feels that way and I worry I’m messing up ANY ability I have to eat intuitively by doing this. 

Add to this I’m always MENTALLY hungry bc I’m a recovering bulimic/food addict. So I always eat my full meal plan despite the awful physical discomfort bc I WANT the food so badly; I always WANT food even if I’m so full I feel sick. 

I feel like with this combination of zero physical cues and constant mental hunger I’ll never be able to eat intuitively, and that by eating past “fullness” so often I’m messing up my satiety signals even more.

I have been doing 10,000 step walks (about 4.5-5 miles) 5 days a week for the past 2 years or so. I started originally when I was approaching 200 pounds because I was stressing out about where I was and was not happy. I got a fitbit which I've been using daily since and in about 5 months or so I went from around 199 to 160. I have always been the type of person to enjoy eating food and it helps my mood but at the same time that means I've also struggled with always being able to have perfect self control. Since reaching the original goal of 160 my weight has slowly gone up to 172.6 and I have been eating more than I feel like I should (I have not been keeping track but it's probably close to about 3000-3200 calories a day on average). I just wanted some advice on if it would be the right idea to try to go back down to around 160-165 again and just what the best weight range and calorie count I should be aiming for. I just want to know if it would make sense to change anything/lose more weight or if I'm fine with what I'm currently doing and the average calorie count I currently have. If it is important the main thing that is causing me concern is mainly that for the most part I'm pretty thin and have thin arms and such but most of my extra weight goes to my stomach area (a family thing) and so if there is something specific for that that I should be doing instead that would be greatly appreciated.

I wrote ""fresh"" originally when I should have added the word ""prepared"" in reference to Food stamps, not meaning to exclude produce or meats. Sorry for the error. 

EDIT 2 ***
This post is a critique of our flawed food, health and social services system, and how diet culture plays a large part in classism. Not all of these points will apply to everyone, nor does pointing out purely systemic issues mean I'm ignorant of personal responsibility and factors we are able to control. Please be kind to one another and don't make character assumptions.

EDIT 3 *** 
I'm seeing the most backlash around the comment that cheap foods are often low in nutritional value. Just eat beans, rice, frozen veg or grow your own, etc. And it bums me out a bit that this is the biggest point of contention.

 I didn't say it's impossible to get nutritious food for cheap, just that much of the wellness industry pushes for expensive ingredients, and that having a low income certainly affects our options and often food choices. There are a billion threads you could comment on to provide advice/hacks on thrifty eating, stress management, surviving poverty, self motivation and personal responsibility. I'm sure this is coming from a place of wanting to help but this doesn't address how inequality affects health outcomes which is kind of the whole point of this post. It kind of proves my point that we would much rather blame a person's health on laziness and assume they make bad choices than consider the bigger picture of what other factors may be at play.

Alright incoming rant.

One of the biggest things about diet culture and toxic nutrition and fitness gurus that boils my blood is the fact that everyone pushes the blame of health issues and ""obesity"" on individual choice.

""It's just calories in calories out!""

""You need to avoid processed foods, eat organic and read all labels""

""You're fat because you don't care about your health""

""We're sick because of all the junk food we eat""

""If you binge or eat when you aren't hungry you just lack discipline""

So we get a new diet every year. We're told to cut out GMOS, buy organic, and carefully consider where our food comes from. Expensive organic grocery stores pop up in gentrified areas like mushrooms.  Documentaries are dedicated to demonizing processed food and telling us we're killing ourselves. But no one seems to want to address the fact that stressful jobs, barely making a living wage, lack of healthcare access, and socioeconomics play massively on our health outcomes.


You can't buy fresh prepared food on foodstamps.

You can't see a dietitian or personal trainer if you can't afford healthcare.

If you grew up poor, or with parents that grew up poor, you were likely born into the mentality of food insecurity, always finishing your plate and eating as much as you could because you didn't know when food would be around again. 

If money is tight, you will buy the most food you can get for your dollar to feed your family, and I can guarantee that's not going to be organic quinoa and grass fed meats.

Diet culture is so fucking steeped in classism that we'd rather blame the most marginalized bodies and groups of people than consider fixing our health care, education, food production and wages to actually give people a fighting chance at taking care of themselves physically and mentally. 

Instead we build more Whole foods in rich neighborhoods, shame others for their food choices and size, and turn ""health"" into a virtue contest to brag about to our friends and family.

I don't even know how to direct this anger into something productive because it's such an ingrained, systemic problem. At the moment I'm just working on reading, researching, and trying to see if I can realistically help make change, but it feels like such a titanic machine of an industry to fight against."

Anyway, my main point of contention (or kind of) is that IE is highly individualistic. This is not a problem — esp. in recovery — but I do feel that it encourages consumption that does not take into account larger processes and mechanisms of food production? 

And please ... please do not trot out trite replies like, “there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism,” because /there/ is a role that western consumers play in the continued subjugation of labour in the global south and there is agency there. This is not to say we all get bogged down in guilt — abolitionists wore clothes made by slaves while fighting for abolition. That doesn’t invalidate their point or their efforts to get rid of an awful system. But, I’m not really doing that. Most of us aren’t. 

However ... I guess, I’m thinking of things like cashews, or coffee (which I know seems horrendously essential), or chocolate. The little treats. When most of the supply comes from labour that is so exploited so as to bring actual tears to my eyes, how can I justify mindlessly buying things (and tbh Fair Trade is problematic as well) because they satisfy ME? 

[It doesn’t mean that my actual behaviour is different either. I do buy hot chocolate once in a while too.]

I guess I’m just wondering how to square with the kind of lifestyle a lot of IE followers tend to lead: with lots of snacks, lots of variety, etc. Which is fine, because ... same. 

So yeah, to repeat myself: I’m concerned about how IE is framed as the most natural way of eating in a culture filled with highly palatable, engineered, and MARKETED food (and drink) that uses resources and labour that do not need to be exploited (and frankly, couldn’t exist without exploitation. See: Coca Cola) 

An economic and cultural landscape where the implications of  “intuitive” consumption means consumption divorced from /accountability/ for fear of re-introducing guilt. I don’t know how I can justify eating without at least Some Guilt at Some Point (I’m not crying every time I drink a coke lol). And this isn’t a distant problem for me. The cashew processing plants that are in the news for the awful working conditions are close to my hometown. 

I Am Not Saying That You Guys Should Feel Bad. Especially for those in food deserts or in poverty (and EDs, etc.) although in my opinion those conditions likely limit your ability to truly eat intuitively. 

I guess I’m saying that I do. Feel bad, that is. And I don’t know where to go from here."
14355,0,"And how far do I push myself?

I am trying to follow [this]( exercise video and try to get a little further in every time I exercise. I got to 20 minutes once, with a break. And 11 minutes without one. When I went for 20 minutes I got one of the worst headaches I have had in a long time, and just generally felt awful. It was a bit scary so I haven't pushed myself like that again.   
I wasn't dehydrated, I made sure to drink plenty in between exercises.... So that wasn't the issue.

But yeah aside from that, I intended on exercising every other day. But I noticed that usually the other day, my muscles are still quit tired and I can't go for more than 5 minutes before needing to stop. Should I keep trying to exercise with this video every other day? Or take a two day pause in between?  
And how far do I push myself? Is taking breaks ok if I last longer that way?  
I don't know much about exercising, so any advice is appreciated.

Information that might help, I am morbidly obese (390 pounds/5'8/172cm). I was extremely sedentary for three years, didn't take more than a hundred steps some days. Fall of last year I got more active, and I went from 100 to 3000 steps a day, some days 6000. It came with some issues, but I ended up adjusting to being more active in a few months...  
Hence why I decided it might be good to try and exercise to build up my stamina a bit more."

I saw my parents' neighbor for the first time in probably 10 years. The first thing he said to me was ""have you lost weight?' I was like ""no, I don't think so "" so he was like ""oh well you look thinner. You look good. You were a very round kid."" 

Like ... What?

Edit/ I'm 28, the last time I saw him was before I left for college or so"

  It's not much compared to some and I still have 55lbs to go, but I've gone from 210 to 189 today. Reducing my risk of lifestyle related diseases and gaining loads more energy and motivation.

I've had covid over the last month and am still recovering back to my previous exercise as I'd usually do dynamic stretching everyday day, swim (hard!) for 5 hours a week, artistic swimming training for 5 hours a week and strength training twice a week. Looking forward to feeling as fit as I did before covid.

I don't talk about losing weight in real life so this is a great please to share little victories."

13387,0,"One of the best things about IE for me is knowing there is more food, there will be more food, I can put leftovers in the fridge and come back later, this isn't the last time there will be food so just eat until you feel sastified. But seeing constant pictures of supermarket shelves empty, even though I have stocked up on pasta and rice, and now I'm sick and in semi isolation because I have flu symptoms I am going to that unconscious mindset that dieters are in. I know logically there will be enough food, I live in a first world country and it WILL be okay. But my lizard brain is taking over and my hunger and fear signals are getting mixed up again. Are you guys experiencing this and what are you doing to help it?"

I never realized how much running sped up my metabolism until I was forced to stop. I never really ate that healthy and was a daily drinker for years but I maintained a slim athletic figure due to all the running. I had to stop running right as the pandemic hit so with all of that combined I ended up gaining 30 pounds. I have been eating so much healthier now and drink 1-2x a month now, but the extra weight has gone nowhere."

11188,0,"I’ve been consciously following the IE principles for about a year, but gave up dieting/quit WW about 2 1/2 years ago before finding IE. I’ve gotten about 2/3 of the way through both the IE book and The Fuck It Diet (can’t finish a book to save my life lol). I’m feeling really good about my relationship with food, and being at peace with my body, and I’m starting to feel like it’s time to come back to movement & exercise. 

I’ve never been athletic or into exercise, and even in my strongest dieting phases I couldn’t get into a routine, or find my “thing” that I really liked to do. I can feel that my body is itching to move but I’m lost on what to do or how to interpret those signals and translate them into an activity. It just doesn’t feel at all natural to me like hunger signal = eat food. I think I’m also struggling with feeling like I need a routine. I like having routines/daily rituals in other parts of my life but with exercise it feels so wrapped up in some of the punishing workout plans I’ve tried (and failed) in the past. 

So I’d like to hear how you handled this on your journey! How did you find movement you enjoyed? How did you work it into your life?"

It can combat victimhood, foster a sense of agency, encourage action, and reveal our strengths.

Responsibility can free us from hopelessness, helplessness, and powerlessness.

13274,0,"I thought I knew what being satisfied after a meal felt like. I thought it was just ""being kind of full"".
But no, satisfaction is a whole other feeling I didn't even know I could have.

I have been practicing intuitive eating (and the F\*ck it diet) for a couple of months now and have really started to lean into complete permission to eat **anything** and **everything** in **any quantity** I want.
For so long I was scared I would just not stop eating, but I just decided; you know what, ""f\*uck it""!
And I went HAM.

I ate everything I craved. I ate past fullness a lot and have felt uncomfortably full many times. But I kept eating what and how much I craved.
I definitely gained some weight, but that felt good and safe. I was feeding my body and making the panic stop by lovingly saying: ""see, there is no famine. There is food, and you can have as much of it as you want.""

After two weeks of doing this, I was eating an evening snack and I suddenly felt a feeling I don't remember ever feeling before after a meal.
Such a soft, gentle feeling.
And then it suddenly dawned on me that this is what satisfaction feels like. I felt comfortably full and... satisfied.

wow.

I have never felt this feeling before....

Sure, I have felt full, but *satisfied*?
I don't think satisfaction ever had the chance to enter the chat when guilt, shame, obsessive food thoughts and restriction where hogging the server.

In the next couple of days this feeling kept happening! I would eat what I craved, a nice meal and then boom, all of a sudden; \*ahh\* I''m satisfied.
I can have more later if I want, but I'm just, cool right now.

And I move on.
And don't think about food all that much for the next couple of hours, until I'm hungry again.

WHAT?! How is this possible!? This is wild.
I am so surprised, and am wondering if any of you ever had a similar experiënce.

Also, for those of you who think you will never stop eating, binge forever and never be satisfied: 
You will stop eating, you won't binge forever and you *will* be satisfied, it might just catch you by surprise."
