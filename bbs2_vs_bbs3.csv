0,fp,"This is my third monthly post. I started losing weight in March of last year, and have been tracking calories in MFP for 92 days now. I‚Äôm a few days late on my post, but I hit 345.6 today, effectively knocking out my second goal and getting back down to approximately the weight I was at the end of high school. I still have a long way to go, but it‚Äôs a bit surreal, as I haven‚Äôt been at a weight this low in 11 years. I also bought some new clothes and have gone down a shirt size and down two sizes in my jeans. My next goal is 100 lbs lost, so I probably won‚Äôt make a post next month, but when I hit that. Given my pace so far, I‚Äôm hoping to be there in around 2-ish months. We‚Äôll see. Anyway, here‚Äôs a face comparison from last winter to this morning. Definitely starting to see some face bones and my jaw start to peek out. "
1,fp,"I'm 15, my whole life up until around a month ago revolved around waking up going to school coming home and playing video games then repeat and repeat and repeat. That's been my life for as long as I can remember. 2022 began and I decided I had to fix my shit.

It's been going well, I'm gaining weight, I'm getting the body I want, my mental health was good up until this week and I'm generally just getting better. 

However I've hit a huge bump this week. I don't have anything to do. I do some half arsed revision, work out, then I play video games. I don't know what to do with myself. I end up just falling back into my old routine of just doing nothing. Now I'm getting stressed as well which has never happened to me before. I feel like I'm just wasting time doing absolutely nothing. 

Anyone got any tips or any way they got around this?"
2,fp,"I‚Äôm currently on Lexapro and am one if the lucky people who experience the side effect of never feeling satiated. Like I can be finishing a third helping of dinner, feel uncomfortable fullness in my belly, but have hunger in my esophagus, if that makes sense. I‚Äôm always hungry and lethargic and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it."
3,fp,"Even at a size 3/5 i was still considered overweight with a BMI of 27.5...... Its 2018 lets rethink this....
Now im [31F] with a few more #'s from then but still no bigger than a size M or L at most stores. If i was not curvey my life insurance would not be rated.... Just saying. Unfair to charge me more due to my shape or judge me on a chart that doesnt consider the many different shapes of women. 
Being told im overweight growing up by the one chart insurance and doctors refer to was hard as im sure it still is for other young women. The doctors all say im healthy but its hard to think you are when the ONLY measurement you are scrutinized with is telling you how obese you are.

They should measure more than hight and weight for us lady's... Use common sense!

4,fp,"Is it normal that sometimes I don't crave the taste or texture of a food, but I crave how it makes me feel?  Like, ""oh, if I eat an orange, I will have energy, whereas if I eat chicken I will feel sleepy."""
5,fp,"I‚Äôve struggled with this my entire life and I‚Äôm struggling with it now. Every time a man shows me even an ounce of affection and love, I latch on to it and before I know, I‚Äôm in too deep. Almost my whole day and my moods revolve around them. I start to read into the tiniest of things that don‚Äôt mean anything. I keep checking texts over and over again to see if they‚Äôve responded and getting sad if they haven‚Äôt. I start acting like the worst version of myself, one I loathe and cannot stand. It really affects my mental well-being, to the point where I feel like crying; I‚Äôve even had several breakdowns in the past over previous boyfriends.

Desperately seeking any advice anyone may have for this, as I don‚Äôt really have friends or family I can talk to about this issue. I‚Äôm ashamed of how it makes me come across (obsessive, psychotic, neurotic) and I don‚Äôt want them to find out. Thank you to anyone who reads/comments."
6,fp,"Hi, I'm a 5'11 16 year old male at around 176.2 pounds and this is my first time posting on this subreddit. I decided to post something because I wanted some advice on what to do to continue with my exercise, weight watching, food, etc. I hope this is the right place.

I have been doing 10,000 step walks (about 4.5-5 miles) 5 days a week for the past 2 years or so. I started originally when I was approaching 200 pounds because I was stressing out about where I was and was not happy. I got a fitbit which I've been using daily since and in about 5 months or so I went from around 199 to 160. I have always been the type of person to enjoy eating food and it helps my mood but at the same time that means I've also struggled with always being able to have perfect self control. Since reaching the original goal of 160 my weight has slowly gone up to 172.6 and I have been eating more than I feel like I should (I have not been keeping track but it's probably close to about 3000-3200 calories a day on average). I just wanted some advice on if it would be the right idea to try to go back down to around 160-165 again and just what the best weight range and calorie count I should be aiming for. I just want to know if it would make sense to change anything/lose more weight or if I'm fine with what I'm currently doing and the average calorie count I currently have. If it is important the main thing that is causing me concern is mainly that for the most part I'm pretty thin and have thin arms and such but most of my extra weight goes to my stomach area (a family thing) and so if there is something specific for that that I should be doing instead that would be greatly appreciated. 

Sorry if this is the wrong space for this, didn't know exactly where to ask this. If you are reading this, thank you for your time and have a wonderful day."
7,fp,"F - 37 - SW 210 - CW 189 - GW 135

  It's not much compared to some and I still have 55lbs to go, but I've gone from 210 to 189 today. Reducing my risk of lifestyle related diseases and gaining loads more energy and motivation.

I've had covid over the last month and am still recovering back to my previous exercise as I'd usually do dynamic stretching everyday day, swim (hard!) for 5 hours a week, artistic swimming training for 5 hours a week and strength training twice a week. Looking forward to feeling as fit as I did before covid.

I don't talk about losing weight in real life so this is a great please to share little victories."
8,fp,"Does anyone else have experience with being an active runner for years and then getting injured and can no longer run? I never realized how much running sped up my metabolism until I was forced to stop. I never really ate that healthy and was a daily drinker for years but I maintained a slim athletic figure due to all the running. I had to stop running right as the pandemic hit so with all of that combined I ended up gaining 30 pounds. I have been eating so much healthier now and drink 1-2x a month now, but the extra weight has gone nowhere."
9,fp,I am constantly getting ads for plus size clothing that I can‚Äôt even fit into and dieting.. like wtf it‚Äôs annoying as hell. HOW BIG DOES FACEBOOK THINK I AM?!??
10,fp,"There's posts about that almost daily. And I get it, it's rough to look a way that you don't want to. I don't want to diminish anyone else's problems.

But is it bad to say I'm jealous of that one?

I WISH I was even somewhat masculine. I want broad shoulders, the ability to get at least a little muscle, a good jawline, a little more height, whatever it is. I don't have enough attractive features, and on a guy, that's a death sentence for most fun things in life."
11,fn,"I have nothing to offer. No extraordinary talent, no amazing social personality, no charm, and most certainly not intelligence. I scored awfully on a math quiz today compared to everyone and my self esteem feels like it just plunged lower. I'm worthless, just another in a sea of faces. I have nothing to offer to this world except my stupid creative writing projects that are useless in the real world and maybe, just maybe, looks. Looks are the only thing that keep me sustained and from falling over the edge. I want to be pretty, not because of vanity or privilege, but because for once in my life I don't want to feel replaceable and unworthy of everything"
12,fn,"So like. I just turned 14. Reallly frustrated. Already got rid of most social media except this. 

&#x200B;

I found out that girls stop growing around this age and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3 (my asian family genetics have cursed me to be on the shorter end). Most of my friends, some even also asian are already 5‚Äô5-5‚Äô7. My mom keeps constantly comparing me, getting mad that I‚Äôm not taller than her yet (she‚Äôs 5‚Äô5). I get horrible sleep due to studying a lot at a rigorous school, and I‚Äôm a picky eater (I love veggies, but I hate meat). 

&#x200B;

Also, whilst all the other girls in my class are sporty and slim, I‚Äôm a little round and nerdy. It sucks. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 120 LBS and I feel like a pig around my 5‚Äô7 100 LBS friend with non-greasy long blonde hair and skinny legs.

&#x200B;

Oh yeah, another thing. My LEGS. They‚Äôre not fat, but I HATE having thicker legs, and my parents say it‚Äôs such a blessing because boys would love it. It‚Äôs always about being pretty for the boys! I WISH I was a guy, day and night I feel so out of place in myself. My face is dry and somehow also has never ending forehead acne and dark marks. My nose is ugly and wide, and even my mom says I should get surgery to make it look more European/white. I hate my skin, tan and riddled with eczema. All the white girls in my class are so pretty, like dolls. 

&#x200B;

I hate how I fit into pants. I‚Äôm an avid enjoyer of the Dark Academia subculture, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt fit well into many of the clothing. I wish I could fit into pants and not look dumpy or so curvy. Every shirt makes me look chubbier too. 

&#x200B;

As a pianist and artist, having small hands is embarrassing and inconvenient. My fingers are so chubby and stubby, and look like small sausages. My friends have really nice, long fingers and elegant hands. I have scars on my right hand from eczema and my left hand is always stained from pen ink or paint because I‚Äôm left handed.

&#x200B;

The only good thing about me is my hair, which then again I hate having long hair but I was told I‚Äôd look fat if I cut it. And it‚Äôs greasy no matter what.

&#x200B;

My brown eyes are really bad too. It‚Äôs so common, and nobody compliments me like they do with my green eyed friend. I have eyebags from lack of sleep and chronic internet usage. I wear small round sunglasses because my vision sucks and I‚Äôm really sensitive to light. Do you know how many times I got compared at school to Doc Ock from the Spiderman franchise (in a negative way)? Love the character tho!! HATE myself. Ack. I feel so gross. 

&#x200B;

I hate seeing the boys in my class too. They‚Äôre all really charming, and people only see me as mid or ‚Äúcute‚Äù. It feels degrading. I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúshort smol bean‚Äù irl. I wish I was a 5‚Äô10, brown haired, green eyes, pale and slim boy with a charming sense of humor. 

&#x200B;

I WISH. I WERE A MAN. THIS IS REALLY UNFAIR. THEY HAVE ALL THE GOOD FEATURES. Everything about being a girl physically is terrible.

&#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my vent :("
13,fp,"So im 155 cm at 50-52 kg. It‚Äôs been hard for me to go under 50 kg and I think I have reached a plateau.

Ive been eating 1200-1400 calories per day and doing jump rope 3x a week. For the rest, I work at a desk and do nothing.

1. My goal is to be 48 kg and change my body composition (aka lose fat). For that, i know that macros matter so I keep my protein at 80-120g per day. One thing I‚Äôm having a hard time with is carbs. I love eating mangoes and jackfruit and it can easily bring my carbs to 150-200 g per day. How different are the carbs from bread/pasta to the carbs in fruits in terms of body composition? Will it affect my body composition?

2. I really suck at strength training, will lowering my carbs and increasing my protein without exercise change my body composition? Or do i have no choice but to do strength exercise :("
