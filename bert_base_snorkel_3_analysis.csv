0,fp,"F nearing 30, 90 Kg, height is 1.68m. I would like to get somewhere between 62 and 70. 

I've decided to take it seriously, lose the weight and change the lifestyle before I am older and regret my choices.

I will not be very restrictive but rather monitor how much I eat (my problem is snacking + the size of my portions), using an app to track amount of calories and healthy levels of protein, fat and carbs. The amount of calories will be my basal metabolic rate which currently is around the 1,600 cal. 

I already exercise a few times a week, so I guess I should be good on that end. 

Wish me luck... any recommendations are welcome :)"

5,fn,"So I don't know exactly how to describe it! But just after post COVID lockdown , I am feeling incredibly bad. I used to be a good student throughout my high schools, and now I am preparing for an entrance exam. Now I whenever I goto study, my brain kept asking me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? It asks me really terrible questions, Why I have to Study ? What is my motivation ? And the anxiety created by not studying at all is haunting me. I literally wakes up multiple times in night. And felt really bad about it, that my exam is near and haven't studied but when I goto study my brain again bombard with me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? I really cannot describe the problem. It just doesn't let me focus on my study. When I search for my purpose ? I got blank answer which really demotivates me just pushing me back in this cycle. How can I help myself out of this problem ? What my purpose can be ? Or knowing that purpose really important enough ? Or it is just my brain trying to circumvent the hardships of preparation. 

I am so deeply entrenched in this never ending depression, that now I cannot even decide what is good or bad ? 

Please take some time , as It can help someone like me. I also tries hard to remember from my past, how I used to perform so good earlier but I never get the answer. 


My questions are 
1. What is my purpose can be ?
2. Or knowing that purpose that the self help books and other claims is just a stupid concept and knowing it will not create any difference ?
3. Should I just keep myself busy ? How can I stop my brain or ignore it questions ?

Please help me!"

8,fn,"I now understand that you can‚Äôt maintain a caloric deficit but you can maintain your goal weight once you recalculate your TDEE at that weight and feel good/fueled. It has taken me almost 10 years of gaining/losing to figure this out!! I used to think I was doomed because I always thought you can‚Äôt maintain a deficit (true) but once you start eating normally then you‚Äôll just automatically gain it all back (which is also true if you don‚Äôt change habits while in the deficit). I used to think I was just dealt bad genetics, I was the fat kid all my life. But when I really think about it, I was not active as a kid and ate way too much. Ultimately it‚Äôs calories in/calories out, I do believe food quality matters too however I gained weight eating the most high  quality nutrient dense food because I was eating too many calories for my expenditure. Science lol. I feel dumb it took me this long to realize. Now I want to focus on building muscle and changing body composition while in a very minimum surplus like 100 calories over a day until I‚Äôm satisfied with the muscle I‚Äôve built and then go back to maintaining. And I realize how freaking EASY it is to overeat especially garbage food! And how you really cannot exercise it off, it would take hours everyday to do that. I get it now.

11,fn,"Hello! I've been losing weight for around a month now, and I'm down about 7 and half pounds. A few people recommended to me to focus less on the scale and more my measurements, how clothes fit, etc. But I feel like it's been the opposite for me because my scales are showing me steady progress but my measurements have barely budged!

I've lost a bit off my hips so I'm most perplexed about my waist measurement since it hasn't changed at all. And I don't mean it's every so slowly going down on the tape measure, I mean it's been somehow stuck solidly at 32' and it's admittedly super frustrating.

So when did you guys start noticing a change in measurements? Does it have anything to do with my bottom-heavy body type or have I just not lost enough weight yet?"

13,fn,"I wasn‚Äôt like this for the entirety of my life, but recently, i‚Äôve really struggled with being alone. I‚Äôm 18(F) and just recently began my second semester of university in Thailand, which is totally new to me because I grew up in the United States. 
My first semester was completely online, and I stayed with my family in Bangkok, and this affected me a lot. I was constantly by myself for so long, I had no friends, and I think this made me become sick of myself. 

I began my second semester of university partially online, so I moved to my apartment near my university. I made some friends, got to socialize finally, but even though all of that was happening, I still felt so lonely. When I wasn‚Äôt out doing something, I felt like I HAD to get out and be with someone, anyone, but just myself.

As time passed, I became to only get validation from other people, and the asian beauty standards began to make me feel awful about myself. People would say to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so pretty, lose some weight and you would be so much prettier!‚Äù For reference, I was about 5‚Äô5 (165cm), and weighed about 145 lbs (65 Kilos) Since then, i‚Äôve eaten less and lost some weight due to the pressure, which i thought would make me happy, but i‚Äôm still so unhappy with myself.

I downloaded a dating app and met a guy I was really interested in, and spent a lot of time with him, and we ended up dating. The problem is though, whenever he wouldn‚Äôt message me all day, or say he‚Äôd come to see me and end up not doing that, i‚Äôd feel so insecure about our relationship. I relied on him too much to be happy and be company for me, so recently for myself, I talked to him about it and we both mutually agreed to put a break on things while I figure out how to accept myself and feel OK with being alone. 
I want to become more reliant on myself and less about other people. I want to learn to love myself and not wait for other people to love me. I want to enjoy spending time by myself. does anyone have any tips, or any advice that might help?"

16,fn,"TW ED mention and disclaimer
___
I have read the IE book. I have a history of different eating disorders since 2013, and currently struggling with bulimic tendencies. So I have a lot of subconscious food rules that I've developed over the course of 8 years.

This might be a really obvious realisation; in fact, I think it is a very trivial realisation for most people. 

Whenever I have a pack of things, or bake a batch of things that can be counted in numbers (like cookies, pieces of brownies, or candies in a bag with different colours) I always feel the need to eat a complete group of them (eg: if I was eating Haribos, I would them in sets - one set including a piece of gummy in each colour). This applies to leaving foods uneaten as well: I would need to leave cookies in pairs, or have an even number or one of each variety (of flavours/colours) so that I can also eat it correctly the next time. It sounds a bit crazy, but it was just a compulsion that I would always feel. As far as I know I don't have ADHD or OCD, or any diagnosed mental disorder/illness... so I think I'm just very particular about having the ""perfect set"" to eat if I leave any leftovers.

Yesterday, I fried some sesame balls filled with red bean filling (delicious), and there were 10 of them. I ate 2 - an even number - and wanted a third, but didn't want to leave behind seven balls. So, I decided not to eat a third. A few hours later, I really wanted another ball, so convinced myself that I could eat another one, and would not indulge my compulsion to eat a fourth so that I could leave behind an even number. So, I ate a third ball and resisted the fourth. 

It sounds so trivial but it was such a huge thing for me. I woke up this morning and had one sesame ball with my coffee, and didn't feel a compulsion to check to see if there were still an even number of sesame balls left for later. I guess I am starting to realise that my own satiation and cravings are justification enough to eat, and that I don't have to follow these strange rules I have set for myself."
17,fn,"I‚Äôve spent my entire life eating to lose weight ‚Äî I was raised this way. I‚Äôve read tons of anti diet books and committed to never restrict again a few years ago. So far so good! 

I‚Äôve realized through this process, though, that I‚Äôve spent so much of my life trying NOT to eat that I have no idea how to eat enough to nourish myself. 

So I‚Äôm wondering, if anybody might have recommendations for books that just teach me a bit about nutrition ‚Äî how to get vitamins and minerals, and what they do, and things I can make that fuel me up? 

I can‚Äôt find anything that doesn‚Äôt throw in restriction and things not to eat. I don‚Äôt want to read about all that for obvious reasons. Nobody  will ever again be allowed to take away the joy of baking for me  

Anyhoo, appreciate your advice if something like this exists somewhere out there!"
18,fp,"A tiny little victory in a sea of troubles- I had a serving of cereal yesterday!

Just wanted to share with folks who could appreciate how very difficult it was for me hahaha. 

I almost threw it out after one bite but then thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 34, I‚Äôm chronically ill and going to die early, and I am NOT  spending what life I have left being afraid of SPECIAL FUCKING K!‚Äù

19,fn,"Due to gastroparesis I have almost zero hunger cues and often feel ‚Äúfull‚Äù after a few bites. Once I eat breakfast I often won‚Äôt feel hungry for the whole day; some days I‚Äôll be so bloated after a meal that I‚Äôll feel sick while eating the next meal. In order to maintain my weight I count calories, and even though I KNOW I‚Äôm eating the amount I need I often end the day so full I feel like I‚Äôve binged. I‚Äôm constantly eating past ‚Äúfullness‚Äù and although I know I‚Äôm not overeating it often feels that way and I worry I‚Äôm messing up ANY ability I have to eat intuitively by doing this. 

Add to this I‚Äôm always MENTALLY hungry bc I‚Äôm a recovering bulimic/food addict. So I always eat my full meal plan despite the awful physical discomfort bc I WANT the food so badly; I always WANT food even if I‚Äôm so full I feel sick. 

I feel like with this combination of zero physical cues and constant mental hunger I‚Äôll never be able to eat intuitively, and that by eating past ‚Äúfullness‚Äù so often I‚Äôm messing up my satiety signals even more. 

Anyone else been in a similar situation?

22,fp,"Story time! Feel free to share yours. 

I saw my parents' neighbor for the first time in probably 10 years. The first thing he said to me was ""have you lost weight?' I was like ""no, I don't think so "" so he was like ""oh well you look thinner. You look good. You were a very round kid."" 

Like ... What?

Edit/ I'm 28, the last time I saw him was before I left for college or so"
23,fn,"I thought I knew what being satisfied after a meal felt like. I thought it was just ""being kind of full"".
But no, satisfaction is a whole other feeling I didn't even know I could have.

I have been practicing intuitive eating (and the F\*ck it diet) for a couple of months now and have really started to lean into complete permission to eat **anything** and **everything** in **any quantity** I want.
For so long I was scared I would just not stop eating, but I just decided; you know what, ""f\*uck it""!
And I went HAM.

I ate everything I craved. I ate past fullness a lot and have felt uncomfortably full many times. But I kept eating what and how much I craved.
I definitely gained some weight, but that felt good and safe. I was feeding my body and making the panic stop by lovingly saying: ""see, there is no famine. There is food, and you can have as much of it as you want.""

After two weeks of doing this, I was eating an evening snack and I suddenly felt a feeling I don't remember ever feeling before after a meal.
Such a soft, gentle feeling.
And then it suddenly dawned on me that this is what satisfaction feels like. I felt comfortably full and... satisfied.

wow.

I have never felt this feeling before....

Sure, I have felt full, but *satisfied*?
I don't think satisfaction ever had the chance to enter the chat when guilt, shame, obsessive food thoughts and restriction where hogging the server.

In the next couple of days this feeling kept happening! I would eat what I craved, a nice meal and then boom, all of a sudden; \*ahh\* I''m satisfied.
I can have more later if I want, but I'm just, cool right now.

And I move on.
And don't think about food all that much for the next couple of hours, until I'm hungry again.

WHAT?! How is this possible!? This is wild.
I am so surprised, and am wondering if any of you ever had a similar experi√´nce.

Also, for those of you who think you will never stop eating, binge forever and never be satisfied: 
You will stop eating, you won't binge forever and you *will* be satisfied, it might just catch you by surprise."

25,fp,Does anybody else have IBS or any similar gastro issues possibly linked to purging? I don‚Äôt purge much anymore but I‚Äôm very gassy and constantly bloated.
26,fp,"I mean, it's really nice to be ""out"" and open about my struggles. It takes a lot of anxiety off me to not have to lie about them, nor hide, compared to when I was younger, kept things in secret and stayed completely emotionally, mentally and to a certain degree, even physically isolated.
I love my friends and family, I really do. And I'm glad I can be a recovery advocate and speak about the particular experience of living and dealing with an ED, etc. But seriously, why do some people (it's not everyone, but sometimes it feel like it) feel they have any knowledge and/or right to tell me about how I gotta do things? Whether inpatient vs outpatient or some other treatment option that's in between. That I should try to be more spiritually active/connected (no, thanks, I appreciate their intentions but I'm just not a spiritual person). People even feel entitled to say they think I should be (or not be) on certain medications ??!!?. And also, God, no, I don't have any childhood trauma about my parents I gotta work on. And no, my cigarette addiction has nothing to do with my eating disorder, I swear!
It's cool to have people to talk to when I'm struggling (or acing it) and to have shoulders to cry on, and they can be good support when needed sometimes. I really value these things, I do. But please, why can't people just shut the fuck up??"

I decided to start it after a few weeks of shame-filled and stressful binge eating that followed a year or so of intense calorie restriction. I felt there was a need for podcasts and other content that talk about eating disorder recovery from the perspective of someone GOING through it, rather than someone who has already recovered and is giving advice from the other side. I'm going to talk about the struggles I face, especially those of self-shaming and anxiety, along the road to recovery and the road to feeling ""good"" - hence the name, Waiting For Good. :) Please give it a listen [here]( and let me know what you think/if there are any topics you'd like me to discuss!

30,fp,"I don't know if this is appropriate but I'm not sure where else to vent. I have struggled with disordered eating since about 14, not diagnosed. I've never been that worried about it because it always felt like a switch. The self hatred was always there but I could turn off the bad eating habits so I always felt safe. But about a year ago with everything happening in the world I fell into a deep depression and oddly enough for the first time in my life started working on NOT hating myself in an effort to lessen the heaviness that had sunk in.

I've gotten to the point where I do now love my body, even if only for what it is and what it does and not always how it looks (because that is a constantly changing and worthless value point). I have compassion and no longer tie my self worth to weighing less. Yet I can't stop losing weight now, food has no joy or taste. Before it almost had a kind of forbidden tabbo that would honestly help me get back into sustainable caloric intake. But I've been allowing myself to eat anything I want, for the first time I placed no restrictions of safe and unsafe food, I mentally made everything just fuel. How could learning to love my body as it is end up making my eating habits worse!!! It's so unfair, I've spent the better part of a miserable year stopping self harming and stopping the negative thoughts. I've changed my whole mentality through months of constant work and I'm rewarded with the inability to enjoy food since I took away the negativity.

Now all I see is a shrinking small body, I refused to see the smaller body as good or bad but for the first time in my life I'm scared. I've tried multiple times to 'flip the switch' back to healthy eating and it just won't stick. I'm tired, tired of constantly having to eat and re wire my thoughts. I'm tired of thinking about my body, I've been thinking about it every day for over a decade. I thought once I embraced self love my problems would be solved but somehow I made it worse.

Now I don't know what to do, I refuse to go back to the self hatred of before unless it's a last resort, but how can THAT be the better answer. I want to start running and working out again but I can't risk losing more weight. I feel lied to, I'm finally doing everything right and NOW I can't stop losing weight! Back when I would have given the world to lose a few pounds I couldn't to save my life and now I can't manage maintaining. I just want a normal life where I don't think about my body every goddamned second. I got exactly what I wanted so bad when I was younger but i don't want any part of it now. I'm so tired."

38,fn,"Hello,

Over the past about 5 years I've gained around about 30kg. I started gaining weight after I settled down with my husband, I noticed. However, my husband and I are currently long distance, and the last time I saw him he did comment on my weight. He wasn't horrible, just stated that he's noticed I've gained a bit and just to be careful for my health. I've never been a healthy weight, I've always been at least slightly overweight, so I didn't take offence to what he said because I am now obese, and I'm getting to the point where soon, I'm gonna be more than just slightly obese. 

I tend to do quite well during the day, but that's because I'm busy at work. I will have breakfast, which is cereal or toast and an apple and coffee. For my first break at work I usually have a cereal bar and an orange. My lunch is usually an instant noodle or left over food from dinner the night before. And on my third break I tend to have a little piece of chocolate. 

When I get home, I make tea. Usually rice with something or pasta, or some soup and bread. I do tend to have at least one kind of vegetable in every meal. However after tea, I can't stop myself. I'm just eating everything in sight. Biscuits, chocolate, crisps, yogurt. I tend to avoid the fruit, however. I'm not even that hungry, just eating for the sake of eating. I've started using my fitness Pal and have noticed I average eating about 3500 calories per day, double what my target is for me to lose weight. 

I know I maybe need something to keep me busy, but I get bored very quickly so if I take a hobby up, I quickly lose interest and don't do it anymore, or I can eat while doing it anyway. I told myself, today is gonna be the day I take better care of myself. But straight after having my tea, I ate 5 little chocolate bars, 2 packets of crisps and some caramel treats, and I still feel like I want to eat more. I feel disgusted at myself afterwards everytime I overeat like this, but I still do it every day. However I also tend to find, even when I do eat healthier, I feel hungrier. 

I'm seeing my husband in 10 days. I've gained more weight since I last saw him but I can't stop myself from eating, no matter how hard I try. I have no self control or willpower at all. Does anyone have any advice at how to start? Thank you for any help."
39,fp,"My 18 year old daughter (lives with her mom) was recently diagnosed.  She has gone through profound stressors in the past six months (a complicated tonsillectomy, slow death of her stepfather, first year of college) and hid this from her mother and I, mostly to protect her mother from additional stress while her husband succumbed to a terminal illness.  I knew she was losing weight but it was so gradual that I did not realize it was a problem until recently. 

Mom is sort of emotionally frazzled, understandably so, so I need to step up even more.  I would appreciate hearing from younger women how they would have liked their dads to support them.  What is helpful to hear?  What is not helpful to hear?  What should I do and not do?  I really appreciate your insight.

40,fp,"Hi guys, I have had sciatica on my lower back for about 5 years now and I'm around 6 ft and weigh 106kg. Would weight loss help my back pains?"
41,fn,"I am 35 years old and I have been overweight for most of my life. I've done the yo-yo dieting thing. The first time I lost a substantial amount of weight was when I was 16. I was very pleased with how I looked but the way people treated me was confusing. I have a mood disorder and at its worst, paranoia is a huge problem, so the extra eyes on me drove me mad, and I got really depressed. Also, I noticed boys would be really nice to me, then really mean after a while. I didn't understand at first, but it didn't take too long to click. I wrote in my online journal, ""I remember being happier when I was heavier."" And some asshole said something about me looking great now so I shouldn't feel bad. 

I gained and lost weight a lot through my life. Food was happiness and fun times. Something to look forward to. In 2019 I was at my heaviest. It was to the point where I needed to start thinking about taking medicine for hypertension. My husband gained a lot of weight while with me and he wanted to lose it. I half heartedly joined him. He started to lose weight and I wasn't as on board as him. I wanted to change because I was afraid it would hurt our marriage, kind of like two alcoholics with only one recovered. So I started to take things more seriously and was considering my diet more. I counted calories and they may have been a bit low to some people, but I wasn't starving myself and would indulge on special occasions. It felt amazing to be able to say no to food. 

The weight started dropping and pretty soon, I was doing it for myself. It was great to work at the same goal together. It made our marriage stronger and we were both more active and happy. I lost a substantial amount of weight and was at BMI healthy for the first time in over 15 years and a physical showed I was in great condition, particularly due to the exercising. 

Around the end of the year, I was having issues with my mood again. It was uncanny, I would just be crazy depressed for no reason. So I started eating again because I didn't care about anything. Later I realized that it was the weight loss that made me depressed: at that point, one of my medications was too much for my current body size, so taking those MG down made me feel a lot better. However, during that time of depression, I gained a decent amount. When I started to feel better, I was motivated to take the weight off that I gained. 

My mom always made me afraid of hunger. She acted like it was dire to make sure I ate even before I got hungry. I wanted to face my fears and I fasted for 2 days, just to see if I could do it. I did and I was proud of myself and went about a healthy diet. Eventually I was doing one meal a day and the calorie count started getting lower and lower. One day at work, they ordered my favorite pizza. I wanted it so bad and I ended up having two pieces. ""I really wish I hadn't done that...wait, I know what to do,"" and I made myself vomit. That's when it all started. 

It was freeing. I knew that it was bad for my body, but like someone just wanting to ""try"" heroin, I started to do it more and it became a habit. I wasn't awesome at it and eventually gave up when it became more and more difficult to get stuff up. I thought that would be a good time to tell my husband. 

He was really upset that I had been hiding something like that from him. He told me I need to get help or he would tell my family what's going on. I wasn't ready for that so I got a referral from my psychiatrist. 

The therapist I spoke to decided my needs were above her so she referred me to an ED specialist. My first session with her, she strongly suggested inpatient. I felt like she was overreacting, but her concern did make me take things more seriously and I had some bloodwork done. Everything was normal, so my therapist felt like I could do an outpatient program instead where I would go to the center mon-fri for a full day for a month. It's a hefty ask. I make the most money in my household. 

It's been a year since I started. I remember vomiting, then getting in the shower and saying, ""Maybe I do have an eating disorder, lol."" It took a while to click. 

This is so different from my mood disorder. It seems like how people with OCD describe their disease. They logically know their innate rituals do nothing to resolve their deep anxieties, but they simple cannot logic themselves out of the anxious thoughts that drive them to do their rituals. I am very familiar with anxiety, but this anxiety isn't accompanied by mood changes so it flies under the radar and simply becomes a normal thing. I know it's not, but I have to do it for some reason. 

It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm more focused on the purge aspect rather than the eating. Maybe my larger meals are a binge to others, but I don't see myself as binging most of the time. I do damage control with things I ""shouldn't have eaten"" or I vomit nearly everything in an attempt to lose weight. It's not the most effecient way, but it's the easiest for me and it does work. 

This experience has taught me a lot about my relationship with food. I can eat a standard amount, vomit up as much as I can, and feel like I've had a normal day of eating. I can feel the symptoms of extreme hunger, but it's fine because I'm mentally satisfied. I don't eat to live, I live to eat. 

I've gone back to purging being an everyday thing, sometimes twice or more. I had gotten more efficient at it, so it's become easier, and absolutely normal. I function normally and I'm very bubbly, so no one suspects anything. I've cried about it a few times, but it mostly has the same energy of me needing to go on a diet to lose weight. I reaaaallly shouldn't purge...maybe just a little. I'll stop this soon. 

And on that point, it was interesting to hear my therapist talk about what my diet could look like where I'm not obsessive about controlling it, but it not having control of me either. My response was exactly the same as hearing people give advice on how to lose weight. My brain just shuts off and it's just blah blah blah are you done yet? 

So that brings me to a couple days ago. I had the worst acid reflux of my life. I wondered if it was emergency worthy. I looked it up, pretty sure it was something I did to myself and sure enough... beforehand, I opted to keep my dinner down that night. Maybe that in conjunction with something I ate (maybe?) caused the problem. I took 10 tums which resolved the issue and I was able to go to sleep. 

But man, it hurt so bad. I was reading stories about people with bulimia having these symptoms for life even after recovery. This was my first major physical symptom. I knew it was coming. For God's sake, I make teeth for a living and I was actively attacking my enamel on the daily. I joke with myself that I could just make myself new teeth. Funny, but not funny at all. 

I'm afraid now...so I told my husband I had still been doing it. I've confessed this to him a couple other times and he was supportive since I was getting help. He is so oblivious though. He gets hyper focused on whatever he's doing and it can be difficult to get his attention, so I can purge very easily at home without having to worry about him finding out. 

But this time he said something along the lines of, ""I wanted to give you your space, but I gotta put my foot down on this. If this isn't resolved by the end of the year, I'm taking you somewhere. I don't want to lose you."" 

I felt a little numb then. I told him I agreed but also tried to excuse myself by saying it's probably not something I would die from, just really damage my body. I don't know how true that is. 

Later that night I woke up around 2 and he wasn't in bed as he tends to stay up late. Someone kindly linked me to this subreddit as I was asking if any older people were there. So I was perusing a bit and I flashed back to earlier. I was thinking about what he said. I remembered his eyes turning red and him tearing up...and him saying ""I wanted to give you space,"" touched me a lot. 

The worst part about this is lying to my husband. He puts so much trust in me that I don't deserve. I thought to myself, I wish I had hugged him and thanked him for caring so much. Then I remembered he was just downstairs so I decided to do it. I love him so much. Even if this doesn't kill me, that doesn't mean I won't lose him. 

I'm looking into that long term treatment. I think I qualify for short term disability and my parents have money and they would probably be happy to financially support us as I'm taking these measures. 

The acid reflux scared me, but I know myself too well. I'll take a break for a while and then just get back to it. Little by little those physical symptoms will just become a part of my life. I was worried about drifting apart from my husband if I didn't join him in losing weight. Now the obsession with losing weight threatens our marriage. 

If you read any bit of this long, self indulgent novel, thank you so much. I very rarely am ever comfortable talking about it with people close to me."

I am currently dating a beautiful woman who struggles with bulimia. She has been confiding more in me when she purges and I want to know how to support her. 

I have 3 main questions

Are there resources for me to look into and read?

If/When she purges, is there anything I should say or do to help her not to beat herself up?

She has some unavoidable triggers that she encounters. How should I support her when she encounters them?

Thank you for your time!"
46,fp,"Hello all! Last October, I had a major relapse into my food addiction, and this has been the second worse relapse in my entire life. Over the past 7 months, I have been gradually trying to break free from this, with a surprising amount of success. Lately, I've had minimal slip-ups and managed to lose 10lbs! Here are a few things that helped me specifically. I am not saying they help everyone, but they have massively helped me.

1. First of all, I realized that a big problem for me was being able to have easy access to buying whatever food I wanted at any time. I can't exactly shut down every restaurant or store in my area just for my sake, so I realized I needed to **restrict my access to my money**. I opened a saving's account and had the majority of my paycheck go immediately to it, out of sight, out of mind. I only had just what I needed go to my checking account, and I refused to open a credit card. This forced me to adhere to a strict budget without room for food I shouldn't be buying.

2. I decided to set one rule of thumb 'no buying food from restaurants.' Doing the above forced me to stick to this rule, since food from restaurants adds up quickly in costs. Due to the coronavirus, I haven't had to put much effort into avoiding restaurants.

3. I realized I can't trust myself to always make the right choices when it comes to buying food. Stepping into a store almost guarantees I'll walk out with at least 1 food I shouldn't be eating. Even with a list, glancing at a bag of chips for too long may do me in. Ordering groceries online is the best way to go about it for me. I have my 'list' already saved to my account so I don't even need to browse to add things to my cart. Just hit order and it's good to go.

4. I've formed a diet for myself based off of my dietary needs and what works best for my body. This includes excluding a great deal of foods, including *all* processed foods and sticking to a 95% keto diet, which might not work for everyone, but it's what I had to do. I am the type who must cut out all junk foods completely - I cannot do moderation. It may be different for you. This took me MONTHS to finally do. I had to cut out certain groups of food one group at a time until I finally was 100% within the bounds of this diet. This isn't to lose weight; it's to stay healthy and avoid another relapse.

Lastly, I wanna note that I did not work with a doctor, dietary expert, or therapist throughout any of this. I highly recommend doing so if you have the time and resources. I suppose I'm lucky in that I never became overweight as I always manage to fight my way out of a relapse before it gets to that point. However, being overweight doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy and being unhealthy doesn't necessarily mean overweight. Despite being 125lbs, I ended up with high cholesterol among other issues. Because of my autoimmune condition, food addiction could kill me if I don't fight to control it.

These are just some general tips that worked for me. Again, it's different for everyone, but I thought sharing my experiences might help a few people out there. Good luck everyone! :)"

49,fp,"Hello all, I posted here some months ago saying I was able to 'eat regularly' for a week (iirc!) and that was a big deal for me. I wanted to update with good news :) 

Obviously there have been some ups and downs since then, but my weight has been stable for months now. And my therapist has deemed it suitable that we move on from specialised CBT for the ED, to DBT.

The DBT is apparently a natural progression and meant to reduce my vulnerability to ED relapse. As part of that we are doing a lot of ""chain analysis"" of problem behaviours (doesn't have to be ED related, but for example restricting) so I can stop any bad thoughts leading to maladaptive behaviours in its tracks.

I'm just sharing, hopefully this can help others see recovery is possible, even if I can't say I'm fully there yet. 

I have a long way to go and it was a lot of work getting here. I had to stop going on reddit tbh. Also, Disclaimer I had to first sort out my depression which compounded my ED, by fully confronting an interpersonal issue. Once that was out of the way I really felt more able to follow the regular eating and more motivated to succeed.

My therapist said that once I'm at a good place with the dbt and more stable, I can do ptsd therapy, again to reduce my vulnerability to relapse. So I'm looking forward to that :)"
50,fp,"She knows and admits it. She's at one end of the ""live to eat"" spectrum; I'm at the other end, ""eat to live"" (I could subsist on rice cakes for the rest of my life). That's not the issue.

She wants to lose weight. 5'4"" and 195lbs, she's slowly but steadily gaining weight. And hates it. She knows she'd do better on a better diet, but can't make it stick. She regularly exercises, but it doesn't help.

We tried keto. I still stick to it, mostly, but she doesn't seem to benefit from it. I don't know if it's because she can't eat all the carb goodness, or she honestly feels off from it, however.

What's worse is, she has a serious wheat allergy. But she can't stop eating wheat products, even knowing the gastro-intestinal suffering she'll have afterwards. 

I don't know how to help her. Advice?"
