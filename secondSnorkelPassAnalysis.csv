0,fp,"F nearing 30, 90 Kg, height is 1.68m. I would like to get somewhere between 62 and 70. 

I've decided to take it seriously, lose the weight and change the lifestyle before I am older and regret my choices.

I will not be very restrictive but rather monitor how much I eat (my problem is snacking + the size of my portions), using an app to track amount of calories and healthy levels of protein, fat and carbs. The amount of calories will be my basal metabolic rate which currently is around the 1,600 cal. 

I already exercise a few times a week, so I guess I should be good on that end. 

Wish me luck... any recommendations are welcome :)"

I used to be a good student throughout my high schools, and now I am preparing for an entrance exam. Now I whenever I goto study, my brain kept asking me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? It asks me really terrible questions, Why I have to Study ? What is my motivation ? And the anxiety created by not studying at all is haunting me. I literally wakes up multiple times in night. And felt really bad about it, that my exam is near and haven't studied but when I goto study my brain again bombard with me what is my purpose ? Why am I doing it ? I really cannot describe the problem. It just doesn't let me focus on my study. When I search for my purpose ? I got blank answer which really demotivates me just pushing me back in this cycle. How can I help myself out of this problem ? What my purpose can be ? Or knowing that purpose really important enough ? Or it is just my brain trying to circumvent the hardships of preparation. 

I am so deeply entrenched in this never ending depression, that now I cannot even decide what is good or bad ? 

Please take some time , as It can help someone like me. I also tries hard to remember from my past, how I used to perform so good earlier but I never get the answer. 


My questions are 
1. What is my purpose can be ?
2. Or knowing that purpose that the self help books and other claims is just a stupid concept and knowing it will not create any difference ?
3. Should I just keep myself busy ? How can I stop my brain or ignore it questions ?

11,fn,"I wasn‚Äôt like this for the entirety of my life, but recently, i‚Äôve really struggled with being alone. I‚Äôm 18(F) and just recently began my second semester of university in Thailand, which is totally new to me because I grew up in the United States. 
My first semester was completely online, and I stayed with my family in Bangkok, and this affected me a lot. I was constantly by myself for so long, I had no friends, and I think this made me become sick of myself. 

I began my second semester of university partially online, so I moved to my apartment near my university. I made some friends, got to socialize finally, but even though all of that was happening, I still felt so lonely. When I wasn‚Äôt out doing something, I felt like I HAD to get out and be with someone, anyone, but just myself.

As time passed, I became to only get validation from other people, and the asian beauty standards began to make me feel awful about myself. People would say to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so pretty, lose some weight and you would be so much prettier!‚Äù For reference, I was about 5‚Äô5 (165cm), and weighed about 145 lbs (65 Kilos) Since then, i‚Äôve eaten less and lost some weight due to the pressure, which i thought would make me happy, but i‚Äôm still so unhappy with myself.

I downloaded a dating app and met a guy I was really interested in, and spent a lot of time with him, and we ended up dating. The problem is though, whenever he wouldn‚Äôt message me all day, or say he‚Äôd come to see me and end up not doing that, i‚Äôd feel so insecure about our relationship. I relied on him too much to be happy and be company for me, so recently for myself, I talked to him about it and we both mutually agreed to put a break on things while I figure out how to accept myself and feel OK with being alone.

___
I have read the IE book. I have a history of different eating disorders since 2013, and currently struggling with bulimic tendencies. So I have a lot of subconscious food rules that I've developed over the course of 8 years.

This might be a really obvious realisation; in fact, I think it is a very trivial realisation for most people. 

Whenever I have a pack of things, or bake a batch of things that can be counted in numbers (like cookies, pieces of brownies, or candies in a bag with different colours) I always feel the need to eat a complete group of them (eg: if I was eating Haribos, I would them in sets - one set including a piece of gummy in each colour). This applies to leaving foods uneaten as well: I would need to leave cookies in pairs, or have an even number or one of each variety (of flavours/colours) so that I can also eat it correctly the next time. It sounds a bit crazy, but it was just a compulsion that I would always feel. As far as I know I don't have ADHD or OCD, or any diagnosed mental disorder/illness... so I think I'm just very particular about having the ""perfect set"" to eat if I leave any leftovers.

Yesterday, I fried some sesame balls filled with red bean filling (delicious), and there were 10 of them. I ate 2 - an even number - and wanted a third, but didn't want to leave behind seven balls. So, I decided not to eat a third. A few hours later, I really wanted another ball, so convinced myself that I could eat another one, and would not indulge my compulsion to eat a fourth so that I could leave behind an even number. So, I ate a third ball and resisted the fourth. 

It sounds so trivial but it was such a huge thing for me. I woke up this morning and had one sesame ball with my coffee, and didn't feel a compulsion to check to see if there were still an even number of sesame balls left for later. I guess I am starting to realise that my own satiation and cravings are justification enough to eat, and that I don't have to follow these strange rules I have set for myself."
17,fn,"I‚Äôve spent my entire life eating to lose weight ‚Äî I was raised this way. I‚Äôve read tons of anti diet books and committed to never restrict again a few years ago. So far so good!

Once I eat breakfast I often won‚Äôt feel hungry for the whole day; some days I‚Äôll be so bloated after a meal that I‚Äôll feel sick while eating the next meal. In order to maintain my weight I count calories, and even though I KNOW I‚Äôm eating the amount I need I often end the day so full I feel like I‚Äôve binged. I‚Äôm constantly eating past ‚Äúfullness‚Äù and although I know I‚Äôm not overeating it often feels that way and I worry I‚Äôm messing up ANY ability I have to eat intuitively by doing this. 

Add to this I‚Äôm always MENTALLY hungry bc I‚Äôm a recovering bulimic/food addict. So I always eat my full meal plan despite the awful physical discomfort bc I WANT the food so badly; I always WANT food even if I‚Äôm so full I feel sick.

20,fp,"Hi, I'm a 5'11 16 year old male at around 176.2 pounds and this is my first time posting on this subreddit. I decided to post something because I wanted some advice on what to do to continue with my exercise, weight watching, food, etc. I hope this is the right place.

I have been doing 10,000 step walks (about 4.5-5 miles) 5 days a week for the past 2 years or so. I started originally when I was approaching 200 pounds because I was stressing out about where I was and was not happy. I got a fitbit which I've been using daily since and in about 5 months or so I went from around 199 to 160. I have always been the type of person to enjoy eating food and it helps my mood but at the same time that means I've also struggled with always being able to have perfect self control. Since reaching the original goal of 160 my weight has slowly gone up to 172.6 and I have been eating more than I feel like I should (I have not been keeping track but it's probably close to about 3000-3200 calories a day on average). I just wanted some advice on if it would be the right idea to try to go back down to around 160-165 again and just what the best weight range and calorie count I should be aiming for. I just want to know if it would make sense to change anything/lose more weight or if I'm fine with what I'm currently doing and the average calorie count I currently have. If it is important the main thing that is causing me concern is mainly that for the most part I'm pretty thin and have thin arms and such but most of my extra weight goes to my stomach area (a family thing) and so if there is something specific for that that I should be doing instead that would be greatly appreciated.

26,fn,"I thought I knew what being satisfied after a meal felt like. I thought it was just ""being kind of full"".
But no, satisfaction is a whole other feeling I didn't even know I could have.

I have been practicing intuitive eating (and the F\*ck it diet) for a couple of months now and have really started to lean into complete permission to eat **anything** and **everything** in **any quantity** I want.
For so long I was scared I would just not stop eating, but I just decided; you know what, ""f\*uck it""!
And I went HAM.

I ate everything I craved. I ate past fullness a lot and have felt uncomfortably full many times. But I kept eating what and how much I craved.
I definitely gained some weight, but that felt good and safe. I was feeding my body and making the panic stop by lovingly saying: ""see, there is no famine. There is food, and you can have as much of it as you want.""

After two weeks of doing this, I was eating an evening snack and I suddenly felt a feeling I don't remember ever feeling before after a meal.
Such a soft, gentle feeling.
And then it suddenly dawned on me that this is what satisfaction feels like. I felt comfortably full and... satisfied.

wow.

I have never felt this feeling before....

Sure, I have felt full, but *satisfied*?
I don't think satisfaction ever had the chance to enter the chat when guilt, shame, obsessive food thoughts and restriction where hogging the server.

In the next couple of days this feeling kept happening! I would eat what I craved, a nice meal and then boom, all of a sudden; \*ahh\* I''m satisfied.
I can have more later if I want, but I'm just, cool right now.

And I move on.
And don't think about food all that much for the next couple of hours, until I'm hungry again.

WHAT?! How is this possible!? This is wild.
I am so surprised, and am wondering if any of you ever had a similar experi√´nce.

Also, for those of you who think you will never stop eating, binge forever and never be satisfied: 
You will stop eating, you won't binge forever and you *will* be satisfied, it might just catch you by surprise."

I love my friends and family, I really do. And I'm glad I can be a recovery advocate and speak about the particular experience of living and dealing with an ED, etc. But seriously, why do some people (it's not everyone, but sometimes it feel like it) feel they have any knowledge and/or right to tell me about how I gotta do things? Whether inpatient vs outpatient or some other treatment option that's in between. That I should try to be more spiritually active/connected (no, thanks, I appreciate their intentions but I'm just not a spiritual person).

41,fn,"I am 35 years old and I have been overweight for most of my life. I've done the yo-yo dieting thing. The first time I lost a substantial amount of weight was when I was 16. I was very pleased with how I looked but the way people treated me was confusing. I have a mood disorder and at its worst, paranoia is a huge problem, so the extra eyes on me drove me mad, and I got really depressed. Also, I noticed boys would be really nice to me, then really mean after a while. I didn't understand at first, but it didn't take too long to click. I wrote in my online journal, ""I remember being happier when I was heavier."" And some asshole said something about me looking great now so I shouldn't feel bad. 

I gained and lost weight a lot through my life. Food was happiness and fun times. Something to look forward to. In 2019 I was at my heaviest. It was to the point where I needed to start thinking about taking medicine for hypertension. My husband gained a lot of weight while with me and he wanted to lose it. I half heartedly joined him. He started to lose weight and I wasn't as on board as him. I wanted to change because I was afraid it would hurt our marriage, kind of like two alcoholics with only one recovered. So I started to take things more seriously and was considering my diet more. I counted calories and they may have been a bit low to some people, but I wasn't starving myself and would indulge on special occasions. It felt amazing to be able to say no to food. 

The weight started dropping and pretty soon, I was doing it for myself. It was great to work at the same goal together. It made our marriage stronger and we were both more active and happy. I lost a substantial amount of weight and was at BMI healthy for the first time in over 15 years and a physical showed I was in great condition, particularly due to the exercising. 

Around the end of the year, I was having issues with my mood again. It was uncanny, I would just be crazy depressed for no reason. So I started eating again because I didn't care about anything. Later I realized that it was the weight loss that made me depressed: at that point, one of my medications was too much for my current body size, so taking those MG down made me feel a lot better. However, during that time of depression, I gained a decent amount. When I started to feel better, I was motivated to take the weight off that I gained. 

My mom always made me afraid of hunger. She acted like it was dire to make sure I ate even before I got hungry. I wanted to face my fears and I fasted for 2 days, just to see if I could do it. I did and I was proud of myself and went about a healthy diet. Eventually I was doing one meal a day and the calorie count started getting lower and lower. One day at work, they ordered my favorite pizza. I wanted it so bad and I ended up having two pieces. ""I really wish I hadn't done that...wait, I know what to do,"" and I made myself vomit. That's when it all started. 

It was freeing. I knew that it was bad for my body, but like someone just wanting to ""try"" heroin, I started to do it more and it became a habit. I wasn't awesome at it and eventually gave up when it became more and more difficult to get stuff up. I thought that would be a good time to tell my husband. 

He was really upset that I had been hiding something like that from him. He told me I need to get help or he would tell my family what's going on. I wasn't ready for that so I got a referral from my psychiatrist. 

The therapist I spoke to decided my needs were above her so she referred me to an ED specialist. My first session with her, she strongly suggested inpatient. I felt like she was overreacting, but her concern did make me take things more seriously and I had some bloodwork done. Everything was normal, so my therapist felt like I could do an outpatient program instead where I would go to the center mon-fri for a full day for a month. It's a hefty ask. I make the most money in my household. 

It's been a year since I started. I remember vomiting, then getting in the shower and saying, ""Maybe I do have an eating disorder, lol."" It took a while to click. 

This is so different from my mood disorder. It seems like how people with OCD describe their disease. They logically know their innate rituals do nothing to resolve their deep anxieties, but they simple cannot logic themselves out of the anxious thoughts that drive them to do their rituals. I am very familiar with anxiety, but this anxiety isn't accompanied by mood changes so it flies under the radar and simply becomes a normal thing. I know it's not, but I have to do it for some reason. 

It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm more focused on the purge aspect rather than the eating. Maybe my larger meals are a binge to others, but I don't see myself as binging most of the time. I do damage control with things I ""shouldn't have eaten"" or I vomit nearly everything in an attempt to lose weight. It's not the most effecient way, but it's the easiest for me and it does work. 

This experience has taught me a lot about my relationship with food. I can eat a standard amount, vomit up as much as I can, and feel like I've had a normal day of eating. I can feel the symptoms of extreme hunger, but it's fine because I'm mentally satisfied. I don't eat to live, I live to eat. 

I've gone back to purging being an everyday thing, sometimes twice or more. I had gotten more efficient at it, so it's become easier, and absolutely normal. I function normally and I'm very bubbly, so no one suspects anything. I've cried about it a few times, but it mostly has the same energy of me needing to go on a diet to lose weight. I reaaaallly shouldn't purge...maybe just a little. I'll stop this soon. 

And on that point, it was interesting to hear my therapist talk about what my diet could look like where I'm not obsessive about controlling it, but it not having control of me either. My response was exactly the same as hearing people give advice on how to lose weight. My brain just shuts off and it's just blah blah blah are you done yet? 

So that brings me to a couple days ago. I had the worst acid reflux of my life. I wondered if it was emergency worthy. I looked it up, pretty sure it was something I did to myself and sure enough... beforehand, I opted to keep my dinner down that night. Maybe that in conjunction with something I ate (maybe?) caused the problem. I took 10 tums which resolved the issue and I was able to go to sleep. 

But man, it hurt so bad. I was reading stories about people with bulimia having these symptoms for life even after recovery. This was my first major physical symptom. I knew it was coming. For God's sake, I make teeth for a living and I was actively attacking my enamel on the daily. I joke with myself that I could just make myself new teeth. Funny, but not funny at all. 

I'm afraid now...so I told my husband I had still been doing it. I've confessed this to him a couple other times and he was supportive since I was getting help. He is so oblivious though. He gets hyper focused on whatever he's doing and it can be difficult to get his attention, so I can purge very easily at home without having to worry about him finding out. 

But this time he said something along the lines of, ""I wanted to give you your space, but I gotta put my foot down on this. If this isn't resolved by the end of the year, I'm taking you somewhere. I don't want to lose you."" 

I felt a little numb then. I told him I agreed but also tried to excuse myself by saying it's probably not something I would die from, just really damage my body. I don't know how true that is. 

Later that night I woke up around 2 and he wasn't in bed as he tends to stay up late. Someone kindly linked me to this subreddit as I was asking if any older people were there. So I was perusing a bit and I flashed back to earlier. I was thinking about what he said. I remembered his eyes turning red and him tearing up...and him saying ""I wanted to give you space,"" touched me a lot. 

The worst part about this is lying to my husband. He puts so much trust in me that I don't deserve. I thought to myself, I wish I had hugged him and thanked him for caring so much. Then I remembered he was just downstairs so I decided to do it. I love him so much. Even if this doesn't kill me, that doesn't mean I won't lose him. 

I'm looking into that long term treatment. I think I qualify for short term disability and my parents have money and they would probably be happy to financially support us as I'm taking these measures. 

The acid reflux scared me, but I know myself too well. I'll take a break for a while and then just get back to it. Little by little those physical symptoms will just become a part of my life. I was worried about drifting apart from my husband if I didn't join him in losing weight. Now the obsession with losing weight threatens our marriage. 

If you read any bit of this long, self indulgent novel, thank you so much. I very rarely am ever comfortable talking about it with people close to me."
42,fp,Wondering if anyone could relate
43,fp,I'm eating toast with butter AND honey AND nutritional yeast flakes. It's the best food ever
44,fp,"I don‚Äôt have calluses or anything but the back of the only hand I use is like soooo rough. Just feels like dry skin but it‚Äôs weird that it‚Äôs only on one not both hands. Could this be from b/p? It feels horrible. Hand just looks slightly sunburn, like a little peely. Anyone else get this?"
45,fp,"Sorry if this is a common question, but I could not find information in the FAQ.

I am currently dating a beautiful woman who struggles with bulimia. She has been confiding more in me when she purges and I want to know how to support her. 

I have 3 main questions

Are there resources for me to look into and read?

If/When she purges, is there anything I should say or do to help her not to beat herself up?

She has some unavoidable triggers that she encounters. How should I support her when she encounters them?

Thank you for your time!"
46,fn,"So like. I just turned 14. Reallly frustrated. Already got rid of most social media except this. 

&#x200B;

I found out that girls stop growing around this age and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3 (my asian family genetics have cursed me to be on the shorter end). Most of my friends, some even also asian are already 5‚Äô5-5‚Äô7. My mom keeps constantly comparing me, getting mad that I‚Äôm not taller than her yet (she‚Äôs 5‚Äô5). I get horrible sleep due to studying a lot at a rigorous school, and I‚Äôm a picky eater (I love veggies, but I hate meat). 

&#x200B;

Also, whilst all the other girls in my class are sporty and slim, I‚Äôm a little round and nerdy. It sucks. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 120 LBS and I feel like a pig around my 5‚Äô7 100 LBS friend with non-greasy long blonde hair and skinny legs.

&#x200B;

Oh yeah, another thing. My LEGS. They‚Äôre not fat, but I HATE having thicker legs, and my parents say it‚Äôs such a blessing because boys would love it. It‚Äôs always about being pretty for the boys! I WISH I was a guy, day and night I feel so out of place in myself. My face is dry and somehow also has never ending forehead acne and dark marks. My nose is ugly and wide, and even my mom says I should get surgery to make it look more European/white. I hate my skin, tan and riddled with eczema. All the white girls in my class are so pretty, like dolls. 

&#x200B;

I hate how I fit into pants. I‚Äôm an avid enjoyer of the Dark Academia subculture, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt fit well into many of the clothing. I wish I could fit into pants and not look dumpy or so curvy. Every shirt makes me look chubbier too. 

&#x200B;

As a pianist and artist, having small hands is embarrassing and inconvenient. My fingers are so chubby and stubby, and look like small sausages. My friends have really nice, long fingers and elegant hands. I have scars on my right hand from eczema and my left hand is always stained from pen ink or paint because I‚Äôm left handed.

&#x200B;

The only good thing about me is my hair, which then again I hate having long hair but I was told I‚Äôd look fat if I cut it. And it‚Äôs greasy no matter what.

&#x200B;

My brown eyes are really bad too. It‚Äôs so common, and nobody compliments me like they do with my green eyed friend. I have eyebags from lack of sleep and chronic internet usage. I wear small round sunglasses because my vision sucks and I‚Äôm really sensitive to light. Do you know how many times I got compared at school to Doc Ock from the Spiderman franchise (in a negative way)? Love the character tho!! HATE myself. Ack. I feel so gross. 

&#x200B;

I hate seeing the boys in my class too. They‚Äôre all really charming, and people only see me as mid or ‚Äúcute‚Äù. It feels degrading. I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúshort smol bean‚Äù irl. I wish I was a 5‚Äô10, brown haired, green eyes, pale and slim boy with a charming sense of humor. 

&#x200B;

I WISH. I WERE A MAN. THIS IS REALLY UNFAIR. THEY HAVE ALL THE GOOD FEATURES. Everything about being a girl physically is terrible.

&#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my vent :("
47,fp,"Hello all! Last October, I had a major relapse into my food addiction, and this has been the second worse relapse in my entire life. Over the past 7 months, I have been gradually trying to break free from this, with a surprising amount of success. Lately, I've had minimal slip-ups and managed to lose 10lbs! Here are a few things that helped me specifically. I am not saying they help everyone, but they have massively helped me.

1. First of all, I realized that a big problem for me was being able to have easy access to buying whatever food I wanted at any time. I can't exactly shut down every restaurant or store in my area just for my sake, so I realized I needed to **restrict my access to my money**. I opened a saving's account and had the majority of my paycheck go immediately to it, out of sight, out of mind. I only had just what I needed go to my checking account, and I refused to open a credit card. This forced me to adhere to a strict budget without room for food I shouldn't be buying.

2. I decided to set one rule of thumb 'no buying food from restaurants.' Doing the above forced me to stick to this rule, since food from restaurants adds up quickly in costs. Due to the coronavirus, I haven't had to put much effort into avoiding restaurants.

3. I realized I can't trust myself to always make the right choices when it comes to buying food. Stepping into a store almost guarantees I'll walk out with at least 1 food I shouldn't be eating. Even with a list, glancing at a bag of chips for too long may do me in. Ordering groceries online is the best way to go about it for me. I have my 'list' already saved to my account so I don't even need to browse to add things to my cart. Just hit order and it's good to go.

4. I've formed a diet for myself based off of my dietary needs and what works best for my body. This includes excluding a great deal of foods, including *all* processed foods and sticking to a 95% keto diet, which might not work for everyone, but it's what I had to do. I am the type who must cut out all junk foods completely - I cannot do moderation. It may be different for you. This took me MONTHS to finally do. I had to cut out certain groups of food one group at a time until I finally was 100% within the bounds of this diet. This isn't to lose weight; it's to stay healthy and avoid another relapse.

Lastly, I wanna note that I did not work with a doctor, dietary expert, or therapist throughout any of this. I highly recommend doing so if you have the time and resources. I suppose I'm lucky in that I never became overweight as I always manage to fight my way out of a relapse before it gets to that point. However, being overweight doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy and being unhealthy doesn't necessarily mean overweight. Despite being 125lbs, I ended up with high cholesterol among other issues. Because of my autoimmune condition, food addiction could kill me if I don't fight to control it.

These are just some general tips that worked for me. Again, it's different for everyone, but I thought sharing my experiences might help a few people out there. Good luck everyone! :)"
48,fp,"So im 155 cm at 50-52 kg. It‚Äôs been hard for me to go under 50 kg and I think I have reached a plateau.

Ive been eating 1200-1400 calories per day and doing jump rope 3x a week. For the rest, I work at a desk and do nothing.

1. My goal is to be 48 kg and change my body composition (aka lose fat). For that, i know that macros matter so I keep my protein at 80-120g per day. One thing I‚Äôm having a hard time with is carbs. I love eating mangoes and jackfruit and it can easily bring my carbs to 150-200 g per day. How different are the carbs from bread/pasta to the carbs in fruits in terms of body composition? Will it affect my body composition?

2. I really suck at strength training, will lowering my carbs and increasing my protein without exercise change my body composition? Or do i have no choice but to do strength exercise :("
49,fp,"Hello all, I posted here some months ago saying I was able to 'eat regularly' for a week (iirc!) and that was a big deal for me. I wanted to update with good news :) 

Obviously there have been some ups and downs since then, but my weight has been stable for months now. And my therapist has deemed it suitable that we move on from specialised CBT for the ED, to DBT.

The DBT is apparently a natural progression and meant to reduce my vulnerability to ED relapse. As part of that we are doing a lot of ""chain analysis"" of problem behaviours (doesn't have to be ED related, but for example restricting) so I can stop any bad thoughts leading to maladaptive behaviours in its tracks.

I'm just sharing, hopefully this can help others see recovery is possible, even if I can't say I'm fully there yet. 

I have a long way to go and it was a lot of work getting here. I had to stop going on reddit tbh. Also, Disclaimer I had to first sort out my depression which compounded my ED, by fully confronting an interpersonal issue. Once that was out of the way I really felt more able to follow the regular eating and more motivated to succeed.

My therapist said that once I'm at a good place with the dbt and more stable, I can do ptsd therapy, again to reduce my vulnerability to relapse. So I'm looking forward to that :)"
50,fp,"She knows and admits it. She's at one end of the ""live to eat"" spectrum; I'm at the other end, ""eat to live"" (I could subsist on rice cakes for the rest of my life). That's not the issue.

She wants to lose weight. 5'4"" and 195lbs, she's slowly but steadily gaining weight. And hates it. She knows she'd do better on a better diet, but can't make it stick. She regularly exercises, but it doesn't help.

We tried keto. I still stick to it, mostly, but she doesn't seem to benefit from it. I don't know if it's because she can't eat all the carb goodness, or she honestly feels off from it, however.

What's worse is, she has a serious wheat allergy. But she can't stop eating wheat products, even knowing the gastro-intestinal suffering she'll have afterwards. 

I don't know how to help her. Advice?"
