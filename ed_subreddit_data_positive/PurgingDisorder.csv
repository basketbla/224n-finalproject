Do I have purging disorder?,1,sozb4e,PurgingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurgingDisorder/comments/sozb4e/do_i_have_purging_disorder/,0,"hi! so I started purging recently, as in like last week. before that i have purged a few times here and there but it wasn't ever super consistent. but ever since I started this time  I have forced myself to throw up multiple times every day. I was even at work yesterday and I was on a double shift and I ate some food really quick and was about to head to the bathroom but we got busy so I couldn't leave. I ended up panicking and the only thing I could think about was how I was digesting my food before I could throw up. when I eventually got to the bathroom 2 hours later I was so angry at myself for even eating in the first place because I knew that it was a possibility for us to get busy and I just shouldn't have eaten anything. I also bought some more aggressive laxatives and have taken those the past few nights. I don't know if this would be considered as purging disorder or if I'm having some sort of episode seeing as it's so recent.",1644472939.0
I never had a word for my eating disorder,3,sikr0o,PurgingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurgingDisorder/comments/sikr0o/i_never_had_a_word_for_my_eating_disorder/,1,"I just puked up a piece of chicken and searched bulimia in the Reddit search bar, knowing damn well that’s not my issue. 

So glad to have a term for what I’m dealing with rn. I have had issues with food for a very long time, but it’s never felt “permanent”, it never felt out of control or I felt like I wasn’t able to control it enough. 

This is the fist time I feel out of control. I’ve been scouring the internet for advice about making yourself vomit and it’s all related to bulimia. I quickly realized I didn’t fall into this category as I don’t binge eat, aside from the thought “I decided I need to puke this (fucking salad) up anyways, what two more bites?” I don’t binge at all. 

AMYWAYS I GOT DISTRACTED B/C IM GLAD I FINALLY HAVE A WORD FOR WHAT IM DEALING WITH.

I don’t know if anyone is going to make it to this part of my post but I wanted to touch on the physiological aspect of purging. The psychological part is so hard but I just ate a tiny bit of food and my body would not stop burping/ trying to puke it up.  Every time I eat I’m thinking of ways to stop myself from puking it up but my body has learned a pattern, and is acting on it. It makes it so fucking hard to try your hardest to ignore/fight your brain when your body is reminding you every minute that you’re supposed to be puking.",1643795270.0

hi,5,pdq9pz,PurgingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurgingDisorder/comments/pdq9pz/hi/,2,"hi,

thanks for making this space.

i was diagnosed w/ AN (b/p subtype) in 1997 as a teenager, solid in recovery since my mid 20's.  It's definitely been a battle. I've been in some form of therapy and/or medication every since my initial diagnosis.

i'm now 40 and having some relapses w/ purging lately, had a purging episode one night this last week.

I'd like to say that it's good to see Purging Disorder being recognised more often now.

It always was a huge part of my ED, both exercising and self induced vomiting.

There needs to be much more medical research done (and funding) about how to treat it.

Anyone please feel free to message me any time. No one should be ashamed to seek support. ",1630218867.0

So Conflicted...,10,lrzfty,PurgingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurgingDisorder/comments/lrzfty/so_conflicted/,2,"Sometimes I come to reddit to read about people's purging and restricting experiences bc I'm so tempted to fall back on old habits. I started going to a nutritionist last November and when I started going I was eating max 2 meals a day and purging routinely. But throughout this process it been so frustrating to find articles and stuff about people who restrict eating and purge. I feel like I am all alone. I hear about people who restrict and people who binge eat because that's what gets all the attention when talk about eating disorders. Given I can't even say disorder out loud, but it'd make me feel less alone if I could put myself into some category that wasn't as vague as 'disordered eating' or 'purging disorder' because I feel like the description of purging disorder j talks about purging and not restricting. Also when you read stuff about eating disorders online and talk to people about it nobody ever talks about how FLUID it is. Like I used to purge a lot a lot and then I tried to help myself by stopping and I just started restricting what I eat even more. IT FEELS LIKE A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE!! Also recently I realized that my favorite part of drinking is coming home and throwing up because the best part about it is that I'm not 'purging' NO I'M PULLING TRIG its fun like what ever. But im beginning to realize that its really reflecting purging behavior because I won't have even drunk that much and I won't feel sick but I'll make myself do it anyways bc its kinda socially more acceptable than purging and I can convince myself that its not. And the worse part about it is that I've been telling my nutritionist that I haven't been purging bc I didn't count it right and I was really starting to feel like I was making a comeback but no I've been making myself throw up at least twice a month most months. I go to look online about correlations between drinking and purging disorder and I can't find any and it makes me feel so alone. Who am I supposed to talk to? I don't feel like I can talk to them bc I don't want to trigger them bc u never know what someones dealing with and the only people I know who like talk about their eating disorders are bulimic or anorexic and I know that this is all so personal and I don't want to trigger anyone. But rn it j feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm eating 3 meals a day but each ones a struggle. I can't even tell my parents how much I'm struggling bc im so embarrassed. They're the ones sending me to the nutritionist but they think I'm going to talk her about sports nutrition.",1614232007.0
