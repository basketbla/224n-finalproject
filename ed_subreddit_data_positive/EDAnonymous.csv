Our community is ever-growing and expanding and queer people are a big part of it. We want to make sure everyone feels seen and heard on this sub, so we want to do our best to make sure everyone feels safe enough here to post and find community. 

We already discussed it for a bit in the mod team and recently added a new post flair NB/trans. Let us know if you like this or maybe like to see something else?

We have a daily chat stickied every day and we can designate one day of the week for queer talk (like we have wellness Wednesday).

Shut up,6,sxbbe3,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sxbbe3/shut_up/,0,"I had this friend, who for clarification does not have an eating disorder of any form. However, he doesn't think twice about what he says to me, and then goes on about how good he is and how he's a supportive friend.

Seriously. He does the little unhelpful things like 'Try and eat something ' or 'eat enough to stay alive ' which annoy me, but I ignore it because he's got good intentions.

But, he for some reason says the stupidest shit. Not even thinking fucking twice about what he says.

For example, he says to me, ""I spoke to my mum about your disorder and she says that you don't look like you have an ed and you can't because you've eaten pizza before."" 

He understood what she said was bad, but he told that to me. While also going on about how he's really trying to help me. I felt fucking sick for the rest of the day. I still feel horrible about it.

Even though I've told him that I'm very easily triggered, that Ed's are competitive, and all that shit, he would go on about how little he ate. What does that have to do with me? 

One day I told him that saying that sort of thing really triggers me, and he said ""Oh, I'd never say that."" I had to remind him that he did. And then he said,

""I'm not going to say anything, but I ate only [X] amount of crisps as a snack in the past two days."" 

Literally, shut your mouth. Don't speak about that. I've stopped talking to him completely, (also because he's a compulsive liar) but Idk why people can't learn the basic skill of shutting up. I know a lot of people on this sub have a lot worse friends, I just needed to bitch.",1645390936.0

I wish we didn't live in a food obsessed society where food is a part of every social gathering and event. I mean I too am obsessed with food and I hate that about myself, I guess I'm more obsessed with *not* eating rather than being a foodie or whatever. Like why can't I just hang out with friends without it involving eating? Why does every holiday in my family involve cooking tons of different foods or eating at restaurants? My family (asian) is always cooking and always wants to eat at restaurants. 

Why do that when you could just eat a simple meal? I mean the purpose of food is to keep us alive and give us energy, so why can't we just eat the same balanced meals everyday? I certainly wouldn't mind that. Or just living off of supplements like Ensures, although that's probably not sustainable in the long run.

 No, I don't enjoy food. I don't like to eat, I just eat to live. I was super obsessed with cooking and restaurants when I was heavily restricting, but now I'd rather eat the same things every day and not bother cooking. To be honest, once I move out I plan on eating pretty much the same/similar meals every day. I'm not going to waste money at restaurants if I can just eat a simple meal at home that gets the job done. I don't want ""food freedom"" or full recovery. My parents want me to ""enjoy food again"" but personally I just want to improve my quality of life so I can eat enough food to not die, and so food is not a huge part of my life so I can focus on more things that are more important to me like my education.

Like, this isn‚Äôt just my ed speaking, I know what my BMI is and it‚Äôs squarely in the obese region. My doctors, family, and friends have all been on me to lose weight for years now. I‚Äôve wanted to lose weight myself for an even longer time. I actually can‚Äôt remember a time I didn‚Äôt want to lose weight. 

Back in high school, I fell into my ed really hard. I abused myfitnesspal for restriction, forcing myself to come under my ‚Äúgoal‚Äù and becoming addicted to feeling hungry and having lots of calories left over at the end of day. It wasn‚Äôt until I started on HRT last year that I finally got the mental health boost I needed to force myself to delete it and I thought the worst of my ed symptoms were over. 

Fast forwarding a few months, I recently saw a GI over some of my persistent gut issues and got diagnosed with IBS. She recommended that I use mfp to record my food intake so that if I have a flare-up I can trace what likely caused it. Following her advice, I re-downloaded it and immediately fell back into my old habits. I full-on relapsed, falling into the worst state I‚Äôd been in almost 11 months. I finally got re-rid of the app by having my sister delete it off my phone for me, but this gave me an epiphany: how the hell am I supposed to lose weight healthily? 

My hunger cues are all kinds of fucked and calorie counting won‚Äôt work for obvious reasons. I just want to be at a healthy weight, not even like underweight. I want to be able to have GCS without having to go on a crash diet to meet the surgery weight requirements.

Everything That Could Go Wrong *IS* Going Wrong,6,sx6kyo,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sx6kyo/everything_that_could_go_wrong_is_going_wrong/,1,"For the past week I've been experiencing distress over my body hair. Every time I've looked at it I've felt a panic and felt super gross. It sucks, because I used to love it and call myself ""furry"" in a light-hearted way.

Well, thanks to Family Day here in Canada, plus a well timed meeting, I've had a four day weekend.

What went down:

- I snapped at my coworker and felt really bad even though we were both in a shitty mood from doing physical labour in a hailstorm all day 

- Went home, and binged. Despite it still hailing I rode my bike down to the Walmart and bought a shit ton of magnesium citrate before coming home and binging AGAIN. Didn't take the laxatives yet, however, as it was Thursday night and I just wanted to chill.

- I spent Friday biking to various fast food chains and absolutely embarrassing myself in the parking lot with impromptu binges and then taking laxatives after. The whole fucking day.

- this leads to a magnesium citrate overdose and I'm pretty sure I'm going to die at this point as my heart is being funky, and I text my friend to make light of it. He is not amused, and tells me to stop joking about overdosing. Fair enough.

- I attempt to cut my ex gf off completely because I'm sick of her caring about me, she stubbornly refuses to be cut off. This only proceeds to make me feel worse and this leads to me 

- shitting myself in the bathtub while shaving my entire body free of body hair for two hours with cold water running. It was awful, i cut myself up because I never shaved before. -2/10.

- Felt awful after shaving myself because now instead of looking like a kid I just look pathetic. I crawl myself to bed where I shit myself twice during the night.

Anyways, it's Sunday afternoon, I still have a stomach ache and I feel awful for behaving so rudely to the people I'm close to-- but i have no desire to apologize, nor do I know how. My last crumb of self awareness is looking at this dumpster fire and going ""wtf"". :(

And to top it all off, the one place i was supposed to get intake at refused to take me because I'm not local and then charged me 50$ for it.

I already have pre-existing chronic illnesses/conditions and have been trying to start getting medical care for them, yet here I am fucking up my body even more. Being malnourished from food restriction combined with the strain from chronic constipation + compulsive over-exercising/weight-training has resulted in injury after injury. First, I had a suspected spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak almost a year ago that's ruined my life, then what seems like a pelvic organ prolapse several months ago, and now‚Äîas if parts of my internal organs falling into my vagina wasn't enough‚ÄîI've developed what seems to be a grade-3 hemorrhoid or something prolapsing out of my asshole too. 

I've only been anorexic for a couple of years, and I have such a high caloric intake and low activity level compared to others with restrictive EDs. It doesn't feel like my ED is ""bad enough"" for these kinds of physical repercussions. I keep thinking that surely this can't be real, surely my restriction isn't actually related, but my research draws shows that that malnutrition fucks with collagen as well as bone density due to hormonal changes, and risk factors for CSF leaks and prolapse include........ issues with collagen, low estrogen, straining due to constipation, and/or Valsalva from lifting heavy weights. ü§° 

I have so much guilt talking to a doctor about any of this because the fact is that this damage is probably my own fault, and yet I'm continuing to engage in the behaviours that I'm sure played a role in it.

It was so severe and with that came the fainting, and other physical side effects obviously. Suddenly after around 5 months something in me changed and my appetite increased I felt happier and I gave up and started eating whatever I wanted, which turned into binging and eating EXCESSIVE amounts more than ever before. This lasted about another 5 months however I surprisingly barely gained any weight, which also makes no sense but despite being happy I was still consumed with overwhelming guilt about my food intake. Then, the switch happened again and I started heavily restricting and became depressed but also had no appetite whatsoever. Of course the fainting, weight loss and the rest of the symptoms happened again. This time Id say it lasted around 3/4 months but I got to a weight my body can barely function at.

coworker triggered me,13,swuili,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/swuili/coworker_triggered_me/,3,"hi everyone. im posting this on here because I really want to get this off my chest, its been bothering me for a while. this is also my first post so pls bear with me

to give some background, I've been working at my current job for about four months. ever since I started, I've had this coworker that's gotten on my nerves quite often. for some reason he always makes me the butt of his jokes, teases me, and just generally bothers me. for example, he made fun of me clothes one time and said I wear grandma pants bc the jeans I was wearing that day fit a little big. when I didn't follow him back on instagram he kept bringing it up every time he saw me for about two weeks. im 18 and he's in his late 20s to early 30s, I don't want to follow him on instagram. I wasn't very comfortable giving it to him in the first place but I didn't say no because I didn't want to be rude.

anyways, fast forward to yesterday (02/18). our job got pizza delivered and there was about 6 ish boxes? maybe more. when I went on lunch he was in the break room as well. as soon as I walk in, he starts making jokes at me. I decide to have a piece of pizza bc I was hungry and didnt bring my own food for the day. one piece. literally the smallest slice in the box. as soon as I take a bite, he says, ""oh, you know you aren't allowed to eat that."" I immediately freak out bc I believe him, he says its for a certain department at our work (that im not apart of). he then laughs at me and our coworker has to tell me he's joking. after he finishes laughing at me, he then says, ""wow, you just went right in for that pizza! you didn't even ask, you just went straight in for it!"" that last comment is what really triggered me. while it wasn't intentional, and obviously he doesn't know I struggle with this kind of thing, it really triggered me. I felt embarrassed of how I ate. feeling embarrassed of how I eat and comments about how I eat is what made me start developing disordered eating in the first place. so it actually really got to me. when I got home from work I cried. it was embarrassing and just stupid how one small comment ruined my day.",1645337573.0

Struggling immensely with C/Sing and I don't know how to stop. Vent/looking for advice.,4,swwa5j,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/swwa5j/struggling_immensely_with_csing_and_i_dont_know/,1,"First off - this is a side account of mine hence the lack of posts, as I'm way too nervous to post on my main account. Second - not sure if the TW flair is warranted here but I thought I'd rather be safe than sorry. No weight/cal/etc numbers mentioned

Anyway -

I'll cut to the chase right away. I (23F) have been struggling with chewing & spitting for almost two years and I really..... want to stop but I'm struggling immensely. 

I've been struggling with anorexia for several years now, and C/Sing is relatively ""new"" in regards to eating disordered behavior for myself. In summer 2020, I started having these really.... bad intrusive thoughts of ""If you finish eating that, something bad will happen"", and they became extremely debilitating to the point it was about EVERYTHING I ate. I'd spit food out halfway through because the thoughts were so bad. The only things I could get down were protein drinks. Any solid foods were spit out because my brain kept insisting that if I finished the food, something bad (family hurt, pet dead, etc) would happen. 

As time went on, it sort of clicked in my head that ""I can just C/S foods - won't gain weight, won't deal with the guilt."" At first it was just something I did once in awhile or to combat the bad thoughts, but as time went on, it became worse and worse to the point of a full blown addiction and I was spending probably about $100 weekly on just food to C/S. This was in summer-winter 2020. 

It slowed down and picked up, slowed down and picked up, over and over all throughout 2021. I've come very close to canning it several times (something in my head would just like.... turn off and I'd have no desire or urge to). But ultimately, it would come back, and I'd start again. 

I've tried to identify what my triggers are - hunger doesn't bother me, so it's not that. Stress? I could be having a good day and my brain will go ""Yeah, let's C/S candy later and today will be even better!"" Tired? Could've gotten a full night of sleep. So far I think what it is is.... routine of it, cravings, and something about the action of tasting whatever it is and then spitting it out gives me... almost a rush? But then, of course, immediately after it, I feel nasty and guilty. I've tried to sit with that feeling and remember it but my brain always just goes back to ""Just ONE more time"".

It's started to impact me physically. I'm bloated very very often now, and I have little to no actual appetite. The desire to eat the food I C/S isnt there, or for any food at all. Like if I could I'd ONLY C/S but I dont want that. I think it's also the reason I've put on weight and am now at the highest weight I've been since 2017 because I read it can impact insulin? And I know I'm definitely swallowing a little bit of it every time. 

At this point I just feel hopeless with it. I'm not in therapy anymore; resources are like nonexistent where I live currently (very rural area), I don't have a car, I don't have friends (not an exaggeration at all), nor am I close with my family, I've tried online therapy but I already struggle BIG time with trusting & connecting with therapists/people in general and the online aspect just made it 10x harder. I've seen people recommend working ""safe foods"" in but even that scares the hell out of me because it means eating more and if I ate every time I had the C/S urge, I don't even want to think about how much I'b be eating. I've tried gum but it doesn‚Äôt satiate me the same way, and distracting myself only goes so far as eventually it hits a point where ALL I can think about is C/Sing and I'm antsy and restless and digging through my cabinets for ANYTHING, even if it's like half a bag of stale chocolate chips.

I just.... who else has had it this bad? How the hell do I kick this on my own??? I just feel stuck and miserable and awful all of the time but I don't know what to do at this point. Thanks.",1645344456.0

tw: eating issues, childhood trauma, bodyshaming/negative comments around weight, body dysphoria 

i don‚Äôt have an ed so i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm allowed to post here i‚Äôm mostly just lurking in ed subreddits bc i relate to the content and i feel less alone (much better than twitter where ppl get bodyshamed constantly, post triggering stuff without any warning (more on sh side) and stuff so i just feel safer here) and i‚Äôm on mobile bc i‚Äôm in bed so sorry for format if i‚Äôm not allowed to be here just lmk and i‚Äôll head over to another subreddit to post this :)

ive been struggling with eating my whole life bc as a kid i wasn‚Äôt allowed to eat very much, partially bc my dad hates me (not even an exaggeration after the shit he‚Äôs done bc he‚Äôs done worse)(i wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to eat if i didn‚Äôt do an insane amount of chores for a child) and partially bc he did not want me to gain weight at all. i was SEVERLY underweight as a child (not giving out any numbers in this post i don‚Äôt want to give ppl something to trigger them). there were quite a few of those diet books that my dad had he would keep them out where i could see them. this lead to as a kid me constantly being terrified of gaining weight bc i didn‚Äôt want my dad hating me even more. even when i was allowed to eat it was hard bc everyone would comment on how much i ate. my dad would constantly go and bodyshame ppl constantly including me when i was a literal CHILD (i left his house at 13). 

he didn‚Äôt really treat any of my siblings like this as much it was mostly me who got food restricted from me (although i do think my dad being like this towards me and bodyshaming ppl could have been a partial cause for my brother‚Äôs ed bc once my brother got back from my dads house (split parents) and was talking about how my dad said ppl shouldn‚Äôt follow anyone who‚Äôs plussized online i won‚Äôt go into detail bc it‚Äôs DISGUSTING the comments my dad made especially considering the fact he knows full well my brother has an ed and is in recovery)

after i got out of there i was allowed to eat and still struggled with eating but i eventually reached a healthy weight and hit puberty not too long after. i‚Äôm a trans man (and personally have severe body dysphoria im mentioning that bc ik not every trans person does experience that) so that was fucking hell especially when the changes started happening. when i got boobs that‚Äôs when my eating issues continued to get bad. i can‚Äôt get top surgery for years (i‚Äôm 15). at the time (13) i hadn‚Äôt fully accepted that i‚Äôm trans and i was going through puberty. i didn‚Äôt want my boobs so that made eating even harder bc of the fact that my brain is stuck in the mindset that if i don‚Äôt eat they are gonna flatten back out.

i remember in around april of 2020 i hadn‚Äôt eaten in a while (i‚Äôd rather not share how long) all i had was timmies iced coffee for that whole time and my mom got me food from my favourite restaurant to try to get me to eat. i eventually ate the food but i sat on my bed crying for at least an hour bc i felt bad that my mom spent money getting my favourite food. it was freezing by the time i ate it but i at least ate the food. 

at that point i decided to do more to try to hide my eating struggles. not going into detail bc if anyone reads this i don‚Äôt wanna be giving out ideas like the crayons boston pizza gives ppl with the kids meal. 

the dysphoria eating issues and childhood eating issues keep affecting me more and more. i honestly don‚Äôt know what to do at this point bc it‚Äôs just so hard to eat. and when i do eat some of the time i get up in the middle of the night and eat half the kitchen then cry after bc i ate. i thought ive been hiding it well but my family, and friends, and partner are all concerned and i don‚Äôt wanna worry them. i just want to be able to eat properly without worrying about dysphoria and what ppl think about how much i eat and stuff. i want to be able to just be happy and eat like everyone else does. i don‚Äôt want to be counting the calories of the food going into my body like i do most days. bc no matter what the number of calories is or the number on the scale or the number in the bmi calculator is, or how my body looks in the mirror, i still feel like shit.",1645354744.0

"An alternative to ""all in""/""honoring extreme hunger""",23,swijat,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/swijat/an_alternative_to_all_inhonoring_extreme_hunger/,9,"Once I began legitimately trying to recover, I realized pretty quickly that there's no way I can do all-in. I just lack self control and am way too habit based, and I can already see that even slightly allowing myself to ""honor extreme hunger"" or whatever is just going to turn into long term patterns of bingeing.

I read about a recovery method involving eating a strict meal plan or calorie amount of ""actual food"" that is right around the amount a given person would likely need to maintain at a healthy weight. And then in terms of the extra calories needed to gain, using only supplements like protein shakes for that, so that you get used to eating a reasonable amount of food for meals and snacks long term.

Has anyone tried this, and if so, any advice about what to eat for those extra calories? I can't deal with multiple protein shakes a day, I've tried them all and having more than one a day or so just makes me feel sick. I'd add in healthy bars like Kind or Lara bars, but the problem there is that I love those things and have always eaten them as an enjoyable snack, so I don't think they'd work for this purpose.

I have been going back to old behaviors and a way of reframing my thinking is that there is no such thing as full recovery - and this is just a bump in the road - rather than thinking I failed recovery. 

Whenever I am upset, mad, or whatever emotion, my ED becomes a lot stronger. But, a way of coping for me, lately, has been to realize that there is no such thing as full recovery with a restrictive ED. Even when I was at my best, I would still track calories of foods that I would consider too calorie-dense.

I'm letting the ED win more than usual, but if I was still choosing to challenge every thought, I would never reach full recovery. I think it would just be dormant at times, or sometimes I would track my calories more than usual, struggle with finding a balance for exercise, etc. 

I think setting a goal for myself to reach some level of balance with my body and food, rather than aiming for full recovery, has taken a lot of stress off of me. And is a lot more realistic.",1645314849.0

Sad to realize how my ED dictated every moment,12,swijjo,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/swijjo/sad_to_realize_how_my_ed_dictated_every_moment/,1,"I was thinking back to a time period maybe 3 years ago? and really sad to remember how ED logic dictated every part of my day.

On weekends, I'd try to wake up later in the day, so that I might weigh a little less for my morning weigh-in (because of dehydration). I'd try to stay in bed as long as possible, maybe cuddle or initiate having sex with my partner.

Not because I wanted to cuddle or be intimate? Not trying to get up to spend my day off doing something fun, or staying in bed in order to rest? For what, 0.1 lb *mayyybe,* that's not even a real weight change???

There was just this overwhelming feeling of needing everything to be ""productive"" or useful somehow, towards weight loss or having whatever I considered at the time to be a ""good"" food intake.

If I had time, I would walk anywhere instead of taking transportation, even when I was beat, on a hot day, through a bad neighborhood. I would do all kinds of activities or go to events to distract me from eating (or make me feel like it was ""worth it"" for some reason, if I did eat). My friends started introducing me to drugs and I was down because it would be a good amount of time without eating.

It was exhausting but also motivating and energizing, as a very goal-oriented person. But at the end of the day, I had all the wrong priorities and I wasn't being genuine with others. So I don't like that.

He was incredibly supportive and proud of me, as he's been encouraging me to do it for awhile now. At the timeof me telling him, I was fully planning on actually doing it. I was gonna tell my therapist, I had already talked to my psychiatrist (who kinda just ignored it) and I really felt motivated to get better.

That motivation lasted for about two days before it was sucked out of me like a vampire when some shit went down with my family. For a few days, I restricted again, and then I was like,""Ok, now it's recovery time."" Spoiler Alert: No it wasn't.

I was in a severe binge restrict cycle for a solid week. I knew my hunger was validated by my months of restriction, but I was so terrified of eating to much that I barely ate at all, which lead to binging. Then I wod try to compensate with restriction, and yeah it was a whole painful ordeal.

Now I try to not eat for as long as I can, then when I do eat I binge, then I take laxatives and fast again to try and compensate. I'm no longer looking at recovery, I'm no longer planning on telling anyone, all I plan to do is sink deeper. Which fucking sucks for my friend.

He's so insistent on me taking care of myself, and I know by turning away from recovery so quickly, I'm failing him. I haven't told him how much worse it's gotten from fear of him resenting me for giving up and deciding I'm not worth the effort of friendship anymore.

Right now I'm living on Huel because my weekly groceries would go bad before I managed to eat them. For example, one chicken breast for me is 3-4 lunches, depends on its size and all shops near me sell 4 of them in one pack. Sure, I can freeze them but the point of eating healthy for me is to it fresh and I hate throwing out food. Same with minced meat - solely packs of 500g which would be 5 lunches for me, too many days for fresh meat to be open. There is no butcher or vegetable shop in my area, I only have supermarkets. The same goes for dairy, eggs, bread and basically everything. I'd love to see food packed in 100g portions so you could be more diverse in what you eat - you could buy chicken for Monday, salmon for Tuesday and beef for Wednesday because it wouldn't be packed as if to feed an army. You could buy multiple packs if you want to / need more calories, but it would help with food waste soooo much! I legit once asked a boyfriend to move in with me only to have someone to share groceries with. 

Same goes for ""guilt-food"" or anything delivered - I'd love to order a slice of pizza. Jus one fricking slice to satisfy my cravings but still make me feel good about not binging on something not healthy and high in calories. Or buy one chicken wing or just half a portion of fries.

I just want anyone's perspective, I know we're all disordered but I think I can judge someone else's size in a healthy way, despite my distorted view of myself. So I assume it's the same for you. (As for my own perspective on the subject: the only woman aroune my height I've seen as ""tiny"" was a severely underweight Junko cosplayer at a con, it broke my heart lmao)

Basically, in your opinion, can a tall woman ever be perceived as tiny thanks to weight/bone structure? I'm 5'7/170cm and not yet underweight but quite close to it. I don't have any friends over 5'2 IRL, so I already know that short women will never see me as cute or small - which doesn't hurt me since well, considering their own height, it's expected. They have called me dainty and delicate, which used to be enough, but now it's not.

In your opinion, can men and women of average to tall height perceive a tall woman as tiny? Bone structure probably plays a role, and I think I have a small ribcage/waist but large hips/shoulders, which I think gives a healthy and average look even as I lose weight.

how do you eat more regularly during the day?,7,swegi4,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/swegi4/how_do_you_eat_more_regularly_during_the_day/,2,"i really hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as pro-ed, because i really don‚Äôt intend it to be. 

to keep it short, the moment i eat something in a day, i basically cannot stop eating - i‚Äôll feel constantly hungry or i feel the need to be constantly full until i go to sleep. this causes me a lot of issues - i won‚Äôt eat until dinner time, and then i‚Äôll basically ‚Äúbinge‚Äù until i sleep. putting all other issues aside (eg b/ping, straight up binging etc.), the biggest downside to this is that i feel fucked during the day. i feel jittery, anxious, restless, sometimes i get really tired and feel like im going to pass out. the hunger is barely an issue here. i work full time and my brain does not function properly. it‚Äôs hard to concentrate. 

but if i eat in the morning or the day to counteract these problems, there‚Äôs pretty much a 100% chance im binging the entire day (or worse, b/ping because i can‚Äôt stand the guilt). i just cannot stop eating. 

has anyone experienced this? is there anything i can do to help me eat more regularly without going into full blown constant eating mode? :/",1645289803.0

Hi. I‚Äôve been in recovery for 13 years for drug, alcohol and eating disorder. After a hysterectomy I gained quite a bit of weight in 2015 and I just can‚Äôt lose it. But before that I excessively worked out and orthorexia. I was on top of the world thinking it was recovery. In these last 13 years, I can‚Äôt ever seem to get the obsessive thoughts about my body and food to get better. It‚Äôs a constant thought. A constant war in my head. It ruins my days. I get so upset with myself for eating ‚Äúbad‚Äù. I did eating disorder anonymous for a while, but it never helped with my inner dialogue. I hate this so much. Can you guys please share with me stuff that helps for you? I try all the affirmations. I try to always say something positive with the horrible thoughts. I try all that. It does not help the obsession or voices. I don‚Äôt care how others see me. I only care how I feel and see myself. But I can never see myself good, except when I was unhealthy or obsessively working out. I don‚Äôt know what to do, how to stop labeling every single thing I eat ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt know how to feel better inside. I keep saying all I have to do is workout insanely and I‚Äôll feel better. My metabolism was tested and it‚Äôs the slowest on chart, so I need to basically kill myself in workouts but that leaves me not doing any because I work so much and out in Florida heat.

Confused.,1,swqagq,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/swqagq/confused/,0,"Hi everyone. Over the years I‚Äôve struggled with eating. 2 years ago, I gained 50 lbs from binge eating. Then during the pandemic, I was home and lost the weight again. I‚Äôm still losing weight and I‚Äôve never been lighter in my life, but I‚Äôm struggling. I work out every single day and HARD (sometimes burning 700 calories). In Addition to that, I can only get myself to eat about 1000 calories a day‚Äî sometimes 1200 but that is rare and I only feel okay with it if I burned a ton of calories from working out that day.

During the weekends though, I eat over 1200 calories‚Äî realistically probably about 1700, which should be normal, but after every weekend thay I‚Äôm not disciplined, I hop on the scale and the number kills me. 

Last night I had a moment, where I ate nachos. They were so good, but I ate all of them, and I started sobbing because I wanted to be disciplined this weekend. I felt terrible.

This morning, I woke up thinking to myself that I am done with my poor eating habits and struggling with eating. I‚Äôm a 21 year old female, and I should be able to consume at least 1800 calories a day without feeling terrible about it ‚Äî especially if I‚Äôm working out at least 5 days a week! So I decided: ‚Äúokay. Today is the day where I heal my metabolism, and I work to creating a healthier mindset.‚Äù

However, I hopped on the scale tonight before dinner and I had gained 7 pounds from the nachos from the night before, as well as drinking and from eating my hearty meals today. I physically and mentally cannot handle gaining 7 lbs in 2 days and if I continue to eat like this, I‚Äôm terrified of gaining weight. I feel helpless and have no idea what to do, because now I feel like I need to go back to 1000 calories a day but I know my thinking is not healthy. 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has any advice/thoughts/encouragement that they would like to share with me, and if so, I would greatly appreciate it. I just don‚Äôt know how to get my life back. Thank you!",1645323460.0

I was in treatment around the time ""Skins"" was big and ~I didn't eat for three days so I could be lovely~ was doing the rounds on tumblr. A girl I was friendly with and I came up with what we thought was a hilarious game - we'd use the quote, but replace ""I could be lovely"" with some violently disgusting and/or embarrassing thing we'd done as a result of having an eating disorder. It's pretty childish but you have to laugh sometimes, right?   
  
My go-to option (which I have already shared in a comment on another post because i have zero shame) is the time I had a grand mal seizure and pissed myself while shoplifting wine (pretty sure the split wine and broken glass concealed the piss üòé Not a *great* win, admittedly). ~I didn't eat for three days so I could keel over and piss on the floor in tesco while nicking booze~ would look *great* on a tumblr ""aesthetic"" post!

I‚Äôm soooo burnt out by my ED but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be rid of it,5,sw4jyj,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sw4jyj/im_soooo_burnt_out_by_my_ed_but_i_dont_think_ill/,0,"[This is most definitely a rant and rave but I wanted to try out the new queer flair because it relates to half my rant]

I‚Äôm so burnt out by having an ED, if that‚Äôs even what I have. I have no idea where the line between ED and disordered eating falls and where I fall on that line because it so often seem to rely on such a subjective measure of your own behavior when differentiating the two, and my brain is either constantly gaslighting itself or trying to be honest and those sides bicker so much that idk what the truth is anymore. All I know is whether it be an ED or disorder eating, I‚Äôm sick of it.

In the past, I‚Äôve undeniably had a full blown eating disorder (restricting), but I eschewed some of the check off the box behaviors while keeping the essence of it all. My childhood was not good, and I have a shitload of trauma (like real PTSD too, it‚Äôs fun!), and sometimes (ok ALOT of times) if something is upsetting me I just kinda turn myself off to it. I don‚Äôt pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist, but my mind almost will treat it as if it doesn‚Äôt. My ED behaviors were causing lots of problems, so I kinda shut myself off to them. I deleted MyFitnessPal, hid my scale for awhile, refused to look down at my torso, tried to only rarely pinch my skin down there for fat, etc etc. I stopped being crazy anxious about every calorie 24/7. I stopped doing most of the things that make it easy to go ‚Äúyou have an easy disorder‚Äù, but I‚Äôm not any different. Earlier I was at the store to pick up some salad, and I was trying to remember what movie I wanted to watch while kinda just low key observing diff people grab their groceries and suddenly I just thought ‚Äúdamn it would be so nice to watch my movie with a big bowl of ice cream‚Äù. And honestly I‚Äôd like that more than anything in the world, to sit down and watch a movie with a big bowl of ice cream. But I can‚Äôt. I turned myself off soooo much to my anxieties about food, and why has that succeeded? Because I still live within the bounds of my ED. I turned off my severe anxieties about food and started eating a bit more but I still eat very little.  Less anxiety, less of the overt behaviors, but it‚Äôs [the ED] really just still kinda there. I don‚Äôt even know the last time I‚Äôve had a bowl of ice cream and watched a movie. Last year I definitely had some big binges because of some really shitty stuff I was going through and I think I might have done it last then, but like it‚Äôs still been awhile still‚Ä¶ and if one excludes those emotional chaos induced binges it‚Äôs been even longer.

I want nothing more than to eat‚Ä¶ just eat like a normal person‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think I ever will be able to. A lot of my negative relationship with my body and food really started with my dad making fun of my weight in 6th grade, and then really became an ED because of middle school social pressures the next year. My dad clearly has an ED, my Mom has disordered eating, and the behaviors are present in some of my grandparents. My childhood was fucked up in lots of ways. I‚Äôve gone to a psychiatrist, and like although I‚Äôm not crazy, the fact I basically didn‚Äôt have a single person show me love (coupled with physical and emotional abuse) basically past the baby stage really fucked me up irreversibly. It‚Äôs not something that really can be undone because I missed out on a lot of the parental love necessary to development. I can grow and get better, but the 5yo child who would grab their own bandaids when they scraped their knee because their mother didn‚Äôt care and the child who endured his fathers physical abuse and later teasing about his weight will always remain to a degree. And like that‚Äôs the part of me where my ED/ relationship with my body and food is rooted. 

Being gay then just made everything worse, my brain essentially mirroring how a lot of women were socialized because I see ‚Äúsmall cute woman make man happy‚Äù EVERYWHERE and like because my dad was abusive and already making fun of my weight, my brain just kinda developed weird because that‚Äôs the only template for achieving male validation it had. I don‚Äôt desire to look like a girl, but traits like the obsessively fastidious grooming that the patriarchy wants from women are traits I have mirrored. Like my Mom always obsessively made sure her make up was done in the morning and did it again if she was going anywhere; and in my own male presenting way I have mirrored that. Obviously for actual women there is more pressure, but I‚Äôm just saying with that all, and then even further pushed by the image obsession in the gay community, my brain basically subconsciously sees thinness as a requirement for love to such a degree that I can‚Äôt ever picture myself eating at normal levels and even though I‚Äôm burnt out on not eating there is STILL no actual will to change‚Ä¶ anyway rant over",1645256466.0

Instead of following your dreams and thinking about your future, you are just thinking of calories and weight and looking forward for your cheat day which often ends with a big binge"". 
I calmed down by the end of that day and at dinner time, (when i ussualy recalculate my calorie intake and figure out how much can i eat for my last meal) i told myself for the first time: ""you have to eat till you are satisfied to gain your period back. You will have to give up your control when it comes to food. It has to start now.""

I didn't realise i might have an 'addiction' until i was like.. taking 2 in the morning, two from one med teacher at school, then the Main Site med teacher, and one when i was in my taxi.

Crohn's disease and anorexia,11,svrmzc,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/svrmzc/crohns_disease_and_anorexia/,4,"Sorry for the lengthy rant, tl;dr at the end!

&#x200B;

A bit of context: I'm a 20 year-old NB who has struggled with an ED since my early teens. When I was about 17 yo, I thought I recovered, but later on the pandemic hit and it all went to shit. I have been working really hard to unlearn these toxic thought patterns, to feel \*at least\* neutral in my body, and to be able to eat intuitively. 

&#x200B;

After a lovely one-week stay in the hospital last summer, I got diagnosed with Crohn's disease. I had been constantly>! diarrhea blasting the toilet with blood!< for a week before, which made me severely dehydrated, and I couldn't eat properly. My colon and small intestine were badly inflamed, I had ulcers, anemia, etc. At that point, I dropped to my gw. Then, of course, they prescribed me with prednisone, this anti-inflammatory drug that helped tremendously. Except for the side-effects. Prednisone is notorious for causing ""moon face"" (basically a swollen, rounded face as a consequence of water retention and fat redistribution) and increased appetite. In the span of a month, I went from my gw to the heaviest I've ever been. I cannot describe to you the state of mind I was in. Not only was I placed on a restrictive diet (how ironic) where I had to avoid a LOT of food that could cause inflammation, but I completely lost control over my body. I felt so disconnected from myself, the mirror reflection alien to me. 

&#x200B;

When I stopped prednisone (3 months after the hospital stay), I fell into one of the worst depressions of my life. My ED obviously didn't want to miss the party! One thing I'm proud of is that I managed to avoid scales for years, which helps a lot. However, I got badly triggered when I went to get an infusion of this medication I'll have to take forever (Stelara). They need to weigh you to properly dose you, and boy oh boy, seeing the number on the scale sent me spiraling. All my self-destructive behaviors came back, and then some, and I managed to lose all the weight. 

&#x200B;

But I'm just so exhausted. So exhausted that I constantly have to fight this disorder, fight myself. Crohn's will follow me for the rest of my life, and the thought of having to go through these periods of intense weight fluctuations and medically-imposed diets is dreadful. I also learned that anorexics with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) have a much higher death rate. I feel like a ticking bomb, anxiously dancing on the line between my body killing me and my mind killing me as I await my next flare-up. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had a similar experience? How do you cope? 

&#x200B;

tl;dr Got diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which comes with intense weight fluctuations and medically-imposed diets. Paired with my ED, it's a recipe for disaster.",1645216206.0

thoughts on happiness,6,svsn01,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/svsn01/thoughts_on_happiness/,1,"So, like many of you, eating disorders aren't the only thing plaguing my mind. I'm also an alcoholic, severely depressed, may have borderline personality disorder (not officially diagnosed but my therapist brought it up and would like for me to ask a psychiatrist about it), and the list goes on.

People rightfully say that there is no point in complaining about your problems unless you are willing to take action to change them. And that advice may sound mean, but like, it's true. I'm not gonna fix my problems by whining about them. I'm not gonna lose the weight I want by purging and I'm not gonna feel fulfilled by drinking my problems away because these are things that are barriers to my true happiness.

But I also depend on them. Drinking, doing drugs, eating until I'm sick and forcing myself to throw it up, mindlessly scrolling through my phone, sleeping too much, wallowing in my own filth because I can't bring myself to actually clean even though it would make me feel better... They aren't making me truly happy, but they are dependable, unlike other, healthier coping skills which for me have like a 20% success rate in actually making me feel better.

And happiness is kinda scary. You know the saying, ""the bigger they are, the harder they fall""? At least if I really try to change my ways and fail after only a few days, it doesn't feel like a lot went to waste. But if I try for a month and relapse, that is a much worse failure. Not only because that's a month of effort down the drain but because I proved to myself I have the ability to improve. I am capable of positively changing my life and I *choose* to mess it up.

It's almost better to go on like this, feeling pretty confident that I can't actually fix any of this because the idea that I can and am choosing not too is just sad and pathetic. It's practically comforting to think I'm simply broken beyond repair so I can just go on sleepwaking through my life and my misery.",1645218911.0

"Ok, but what does ‚Äòrecovery‚Äô really mean",22,svhwvm,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/svhwvm/ok_but_what_does_recovery_really_mean/,7,"So I‚Äôve had an ED for 10 years now (agh) however I go through long periods of considering myself recovered, until the next relapse hits at times of stress. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs ever possible to get a ‚Äònormal‚Äô mindset around food, or do even fully recovered people still have ED impulses that they have to control? 

For example for me, even when I‚Äôm feeling good, thinking I‚Äôm finally recovered, no calorie counting/restriction whatever, I‚Äôm still TERRIFIED of gaining weight. Body checking on the reg. Calorie hoarding so I can eat a bigger dinner with my partner in the evening. Can‚Äôt do things like count my steps without it spiralling into ‚ÄòI must do x-number of steps every day or I can‚Äôt eat‚Äô. Cannot weigh myself at all without triggering something. 

I kind of experience it like a substance addiction I guess. Constantly fighting an urge to relapse, my brain always tricking me into finding an excuse to start again. One little taste of restriction sends me back to a bad place.

I've gained about 5 pounds from the binging and I'm so sick and tired of it that I don't even feel like bothering getting back to my LW.

But after last night's binge, I can do this anymore.

It was AWFUL.

It started with a frozen uncrustable straight from the freezer, followed by a pint of cold bre ice cream, and then an entire movie theater box of reese's pieces. After that, I ate an entire box of lindor truffles that I was gifted for valentines day. Then, I went upstairs to fetch a colossal chocolate muffin from the kitchen WHILE MY FAMILY WAS IN THERE. The muffin was shit... I finished it though. Apparently, that wasn't enough even though I was slowing down and felt sick with nausea. I decided to walk to the storage room and eat an entire bag of flamin hot cheetos, because I was ""tired of sweetness."" Mistake. I felt even worse. 

After that I waddled to bed because I felt so awful and sick. My mind wasn't being kind to me either.

All night, I woke up sweating, cramping, passing gas, feeling dizzy, all of it. Then, at 1AM, I woke up, walked about 5 steps from my bed, and proceeded to vomit all over my carpet.

It was disgusting. I could see the partially digested cheetos dying it bright red, the swirls of white chocolate, and the remnants of the ice cream I downed earlier. My throat burned with the spice and my room reeked of cold brew, spice, and vomit.

I went upstairs to fetch supplies to clean it up, but bumped into my father so he ended up doing it for me. I felt awful. 

Whilst he was cleaning, I was paying for the consequences yet again, cramping over the toilet and shitting non-stop. 

The worst part? My family doesn't even know I binged. Normally I tell them so that I am not force fed the next day, but this one was so embarassing I didn't have the heart. I've never PUKED INVOLUNTARILY from binging before! I've never even puked! I only ever purge by exercising! I'm so embarrassed that my dad had to clean the puke up. I'm so embarrassed that I ate all of the chocolate my mom bought me for valentine's (with me telling her I was going to try my best to not binge it). I am do embarrassed to have walked to the store in the freezing cold to buy a pint of ice cream. I can't believe I ate frozen food. I can't believe I lied about skipping dinner just so I could eat my muffin without judgment.

If you're unaware, Type 1 is autoimmune and I'm 100% insulin-dependent for the rest of my life. Anyways, here's the issue.

I've upped my calorie intake, which has been nerve-racking as it is. Up a couple pounds right now. But my body isn't used to having this much food, so my insulin-carb ratio is completely out of whack. I try to dose insulin, but I can't figure it out. I'll drop super low, so I'll have about 10g of carbs to fix it. Then my blood sugar shoots up to almost 300. I woke up at 278 this morning. After 20 units of insulin (when normally my correction factor is 1 unit for 50 mmol/dl!!!), I continued to spike to 370 and am only back down to 230 now. 

Anyone else have any experience either this?

Also, regarding recovery - I know that high blood sugar means my body isn't processing food. That's why uncontrolled diabetes causes weight loss. So how much of the food I eat is my body actually holding on to? At what blood sugar level does the body not hang onto calories? I really need my body to get the extra calories I'm eating. It's almost like my recovery is becoming unintentional diabulimia and I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

TIA for any advice. <3",1645217703.0

Also I just can eat things with healthy fats like nut butters and such, but even with those i struggle because of the calories.

Having a hard time,1,svoc5z,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/svoc5z/having_a_hard_time/,0,"I have multiple issues with eating.

Before I get started, the best way to describe my self with this particular issue, is that if there was a ‚Äùsenzu bean‚Äù or something that would give me all my nutrition calories and whatnots, I would happily replace eating anything else for the rest of my life.

I have had good periods with eating, most recently and noticeably when I was visiting the united states, and felt like no matter how much food I ate, I was still hungry. As soon as I returned home, ate a bigmac at the airport and instantly felt full. So my guess is something to do with the ingredients.
When I was more actively working out, eating was better but only very slightly.

1st problem,

I‚Äôve been described a picky eater. But it‚Äôs not what kind of food, it‚Äôs the texture of the food that makes me picky. For lack of a better word, some foods or even drinks feel ‚Äùwrong‚Äù.
Yogurt or juice with pulp, is a no go for me.
Juice tastes good, but if there is pulp in it, it makes my mind think something is wrong.
‚ÄùIm drinking, but theres bits and peices to chew. Somethings wrong, spit it out‚Äù
‚ÄùYoghurt is supposed to be smooth, but it has chunks, something is wrong‚Äù
Vegetables and berries same thing, if it feels unpleasant or wrong, i dont like it. 
Any food of any type, I can face this issue.

2nd problem,

I forget to eat. I have just recently been diagnoses with ADHD, and it has helped a lot. 
The medication is supposed to lower your appetite, but since my appetite was non-existent already, it has made me remember to eat. Before medication, I would literally forget to eat. If I was doing something, I couldnt stop and go eat. The feeling of hunger would be there, but ignored.

3rd problem, 

Eating feels like a waste of time. I could be doing something else, get more work done, play another game, anything that at any given time, I am doing that would be interrupted by stopping and getting some food. Hence the earlier part about a food pill. The waste of time mindset is supported by my metabolism. Wether I eat a little or a lot, in like 15 minutes im hungry again. Without fail aswell, after I eat a meal, I need to poop. Snacks do not cause this however.

Ive gone up and down in weight my whole adulthood between 50 and 65 kilograms. The changes happen within a matter of a few weeks.

What I am asking for is any advice, tips, people who can relate and things that helped them, for any of the specific problems.

I am tired of people who do not have any of these issues, saying ‚Äùjust eat more‚Äù

I know that. It‚Äôs just so damn hard.

If its any use, i mostly only drink water, I dont eat candy or chips or any of that category more than maybe once a month. I dont drink sodas, energy drinks or coffee more than on the rare occasion.

basically ever since Christmas I've been doing pretty good about not having severe binges. switching from low to high restriction (unintentionally, wish I could still low restrict) seemed to have really helped my binges not be so intense and distressing. well...tonight a multitude of factors made all this go down the drain. ive been very suicidal the last few days, im super stressed about my life esp my finances, I've been comparing my and my partners EDs and I'm convinced they have a real one and mine is just either faking or just disordered eating at worst, i helped my partner process their nutritionist appt today and it made me realize how much ""better"" at their ED they are and how much our symptoms are opposite and how I wish I had some of their symptoms, my partner bought one of my fave ice creams the other day which is a big binge trigger for me, and I just overall have been hating my personality more than ever. I feel so hopeless about everything, esp all my fucking eating habits and thoughts. I hate eating my feelings like I always do. now I'm even more suicidal just bc i did this. 

i just ate away so much of my money and my partners money. I feel gross guilt, disgust, and shame. i literally CANT afford to eat 2100 cals in 2 hours like I just did (on top of a meal and a snack I had earlier)!!!!! Im in debt!!!!! I don't have the money to binge eat, and other ppl barely have the money to feed me, so why the FUCK am I eating these amounts!!!! I DONT DESERVE FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AT ALL!!!! WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO GET THROUGH MY IDIOTIC ROTTING BRAIN?????

i havent used laxatives in like 2-3 months but Im nearly positive I will shortly. I'm waiting 20 mins to see if the impulse passes when I get out the tub, but I am very confident it won't. i need to punish myself and that's the only way that feels right at the moment, besides death. i need to feel empty tomorrow. I can't deal with this. I already have so much deep shame anyway",1645166050.0

- My skin looks so much better! 
I have mild acne that leaves scars, the scarring is a lot less prominent now and my skin tends to heal a great deal quicker.

- My nails / hair is so much stronger
My nails are actually growing without breaking, my hair is shiny and only a normal amount falls out when brushing or washing. 

- I‚Äôm not so aggravated all the time 
I swear to god i thought i had some serious anger issues the last few years‚Ä¶ turns out i was just starving!

- No more chest pains 
I was severely anaemic to the point of hospitalisation, my haemoglobin levels were way too low, i would get heart palpitations and my chest would hurt. scary realisation was when i was told this is because of my diet. no longer suffering these effects!  

- I‚Äôm not cold all the time 
My lips were constantly blue, my face was always pale and I was shivering all the time no matter how many layers i was wearing. I don‚Äôt have to deal with that anymore!

should i be worried?,2,sv6v72,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sv6v72/should_i_be_worried/,4,"hi! ive been fasting once a week recently. about 2 weeks ago i was on a 47hr fast and had to break it since my mom was getting suspicious when i didnt want to eat the food she brought. i broke it with 2 pizzas (one small and one bigger than my hand), a cookie, and a protein bar. as soon as i had the protein bar, my hand became super red and felt really hot, my body felt hot and my heart started pumping and *hurting* the morning after that i woke up to my lowest weight. 

now heres the thing, now whenever i fast or restrict my heart hurts, my eye twitches, and my arm *hurts*. i havent even been restricting anyway. ive been having nearly 1k cals or an unknown (probably large) amount of cals everyday and this pain won't stop. i read some things and i think it could be an electrolyte imbalance or insulin spike (??) idk, because im not a doctor in anyway. should i be worried? what can i do to fix it?? and im not at a low weight either...im 5'0 and was 117lbs when this happened. 

one thing to note, sometimes when i eat protein i get a headache that doesn't go away, could that be the reason??",1645152472.0

This just really pissed me off because she always seems to act like more of a friend to me than a mom and she also should have the sense to know that I'm going to be tempted to try anything that has zero calories, tastes like a dessert, AND suppresses appetite.

Are severe stomach pains after eating normal,4,sultgu,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sultgu/are_severe_stomach_pains_after_eating_normal/,0,"Hey everyone,

Recently I've(f15), after suffering from multiple eds for about 2 years, started eating dinner and snacks after dinner again, when I started to increase my food consumption, I noticed that I was having to endure severe stomach cramps, dissiness and bowel issues. I expected this more from not eating but was able to quell that while I was suffering from my ED. Now it seems to be never ending even when I don't eat and is bringing me a lot of pain and discomfort. I was wondering if anyone else has gotten these issues when they start to eat more, how to improve it and what it may be. Thanks :)


Also a side not that I am not in recovery unfortunately, I've kind of given up getting better and it just comes in waves (bouts of not eating or purging) so this could be due to irregularities in my food intake or a result of restriction, the only reason I believe it is in correlation to me eating more and more often is because it started up around that time (around 3 weeks ago).

Is it inappropriate to ask family members to temporarily remove a potentially triggering food from my house while in recovery?,6,sug5tj,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sug5tj/is_it_inappropriate_to_ask_family_members_to/,7,"Hi! I've been lurking on this sub for a while now but wanted to make a post to get some advice on something.

For context: I'm a university student who is taking time off from classes & temporarily moving in with my family to fully pursue recovery. My eating disorder really spiraled out of control over the past few months and the physical symptoms of both the disorder and recovery itself were impossible to manage alongside classes.  I'm working (remotely, part-time) from home and am in the house pretty often unless I'm out with friends. I'll be home until at least late May/early June. 

My eating disorder began as restrictive anorexia, but over the past few weeks I've fell into the habit of binging & purging due to the extreme hunger I face in recovery. Every single B/P episode thus far has been triggered by one food in particular: peanut butter. I don't know what it is about it, but that food just absolutely triggers me to no fucking end. Because I'm home so often, it feels SO impossible to avoid it.

After a particularly bad B/P episode tonight, I want to consider asking my family members if we can remove it from the house, at least temporarily, until I get my B/P stuff under control. I know that EDs can make people extremely myopic to the needs of others, so I can't tell if this is an unreasonable request to make. Having a family member with an ED is stressful enough on them already, and I don't want to inconvenience them further. My family also has no idea about the B/P aspect of my disorder, so I'm scared that making explicit reference to this will reallyyyyyy upset them.

So, the question is twofold: (1) Is it unreasonable to ask my family to remove PB from my house because of the trigger it poses? (2) If it's not unreasonable to ask them, how do I broach the subject? Should I make explicit reference to the fact that it triggers B/P episodes, or should I avoiding telling them about that as to not upset them further and just try to keep things as general as possible?

I constantly feel like I'm slipping away, and I hate it.

I've basically thrown harm reduction out the window. It feels like so much extra work and I'm already exhausted. I'm not actively suicidal (as in I'm not actively trying to die), but I feel so unbothered at the thought that I'm killing myself by doing this.

Little backstory first: I'm a teenage girl who has been suffering from disordered eating for a long time. First it was binging and that made me overweight. My BMI was 27 and I was always the fat one in our class. Last September I got fed up with that and I've been very depressed. I started huge restriction and I've lost ~20kgs in about 5 months and my BMI is now abt 22. I feel kinda good about that, but I feel like that's still not enough. 


The problem is, my mom knows about my ed and makes me see doctors etc. to make me feel better, but that's not helping. Ever since my first doc appointment it has only been getting worse. Now my restriction is much worse. Back in like two months ago, I ate about 1200 cal a day. Now I feel shitty even eating 700. I've lost my period, my hair is falling out, and I have huge nutrition deficients. And on top of that, I've started binging again. I usually binge on fridays, and eat about 2900 cal as I plan my binges. It still sets me in a huge weekly cal deficit but I still feel so shitty. My weight hasn't been going down that quickly anymore. Only 0.3kg in 10 days. I don't know wtf to do anymore. Now when writing this I have had my worst binge today (~3200cal) and it's only Wednesday :((( the weekend is still ahead and it's scaring me so much. I feel so bad, my stomach hurts and I feel tired. I'm so terrified that I will start gaining weight again. I feel like this early binge has already ruined this week. I'm going to restrict tomorrow, but I'm scared that I will just binge again as my mom just bought a huge amount of my trigger/binge foods... 



I've been also taking double and sometimes triple amount of my medicine for a few days now (not saying what med it is, I don't want anyone to do this) as it should help you lose weight faster, because it affects your body in a not so healhty way(well, no shit sherlock) . But it also could kill you if you take it too much, but at this point, I don't even care. I feel like maybe that would be the best for now. I just feel so numb. I don't get the real happiness feeling anymore. Not even from being with my friends. I just feel so shitty and useless.",1645049621.0

Last week I started my period and had a normal flow with it, which was super exciting considering it was the first time it had happened since late 2019.

In all, I‚Äôve been feeling great and eating consistently without restricting. Then fast forward to today. I woke semi hungry so I ate my normal breakfast at around 8:30am. I still felt hungry so I ate an extra waffle. No biggie.

Then I went to work. I felt the all too familiar hunger pains at around 11. Decided that I would just wait the one hour until lunch time because I was finishing up a project and plus we were having lunch catered that day. At noon, I ate the catered lunch and not even 10 minutes later the hunger pangs came back TEN TIMES STRONGER. I decided to take my break at that point and go home so that I could have an additional meal in hopes that the hunger pain would go away.

And y‚Äôall, I kid you not. I ate and ate and the hunger pains would not go away. It got to the point where I was even wondering if the pain was hunger or something completely unrelated. It was excruciating. I ended up texting my boss that I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and somehow managed to drift off to sleep.

When I woke up from my nap the pain was there but barely noticeable. And I still feel like I can eat. The problem isn‚Äôt even the eating but rather that it seems illogical to be feeling hunger after everything today.

 In high school I used to heavily restrict... I knew it was a probem even in the thick of my disorder. But now, I'm much more confused. I am eating less now that I'm in college, but I can't tell if it's an eating disorder or just my anxiety. I have social anxiety, although it's gotten better over the years, but eating/preparing food in front of others still seems to be an issue for me. I live with four roommates and when I hear any of them in the kitchen, I don't want to go out and make food in front of them because it makes me uncomfortable. This results in me not eating much when I'm at home. I also buy food at school, but tend to pick the place with the shortest line (usually the salad place, obvi) just so I can avoid being around too many people at one time.

All of this seems like anxiety to me. But the one thing that strikes me more as an eating disorder type behavior is the way I've been speaking to myself lately. When I look in the mirror, I don't like what I see. I end up saying to my reflection ""Do you like being fat? You obviously do."" And I will repeat that over and over.

I‚Äôm scared of the conflicting feelings about the scale.,2,su77vz,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/su77vz/im_scared_of_the_conflicting_feelings_about_the/,0,"Hi, all. I‚Äôm having a borderline panic attack right now so I‚Äôm sorry if this is a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings. 

I hate the scale. I hate the number that I see and sometimes I even hate the progress I made because it‚Äôs another day of not eating. 

However, I love seeing that number go down. I love knowing that I‚Äôm getting there even if it‚Äôs slowly and I‚Äôm only X pounds away from my goal weight. 

I hate how it controls me, though.

I‚Äôd say I binged today but that‚Äôd be a lie. I just ate a normal amount of calories to most people but seems huge to me.

The first thing I did when I got home from school was weigh myself. I was so angry at the number even if I know there‚Äôs going to be much more of a fluctuation due to increased caloric intake that I had a hot chocolate in anger.

Do I regret having that hot chocolate? No. Do I regret having it just because I was angry? Yes.

I hate that seeing that number can impact whether I eat something or not, you know? 

The problem is I‚Äôm a mess without it sometimes. 

I remember going to my Grandmas. She had scales but I didn‚Äôt really know if they were accurate/what my weight was because I couldn‚Äôt weigh myself naked and in the morning.

I ate quite freely whilst I was there and though there was intense guilt and shame I felt somewhat okay. 

In a fucked up way I was definitely still restricting on some level but I came back after three days to find out I‚Äôd lost a pound. That feeling was so euphoric. I can eat SO much and still lose weight!! 

Because I didn‚Äôt have the scale I had no moments of seeing the daily fluctuations and eating out of anger but I was definitely still restricting and I won‚Äôt sugarcoat that. 

I somewhat binge nearly ever weekend at my dads and come home being the same weight most of the time (this is not a given but has been the past few weeks or so.) It‚Äôs such a euphoric feeling to eat so much, or what I perceive as much and see the scale stay the same. 

How er, seeing it stay the same motivates me to get back to restriction and lose weight again. 

On my good days I want to get rid of the scale, to throw it away and eat freely and not worry about that Nunber.

However, seeing that number Ina. Day when I feel so wrong and feel like I‚Äôve gained so much weight is my only comfort and borderline euphoric. 

This whole rant sparked because I ranted to my dad about the scales but the thought of them actually being taken away when he complained to my mom scared the shit out of me and sent me into a panic attack. 

These feelings are hard, and I don‚Äôt know maybe I was just wondering if any of you have similar feelings when it comes to the scale?",1645047662.0
Being happy while starving,4,su1d0u,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/su1d0u/being_happy_while_starving/,1,"
I‚Äôm aware that I starved because of depression, but I‚Äôm doing a lot better I was able to get on the right medication and combined with therapy I‚Äôm doing extremely well on that area.

The thing is that it the first time in my life in which I feel happy and emotionally stable, and could finally see how  non-depressed people can appreciate and enjoy life.

The issue/good thing is that I don‚Äôt want to die anymore, but it is not possible to be 100% happy and ok if I starve. To me it almost feels like recovering from a drug addiction, it just easier not to, and even if I am in a recovery program I don‚Äôt think that others can grasp the idea of ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier to starve than eating‚Äù so I don‚Äôt feel like I can talk to anyone about it and deep down I wonder if my doctors and therapist are judging me for it (it could just be paranoia). Some days I love food, but on others I start wondering why would anyone like this, eating is exhausting and almost disgusting.

I‚Äôm not going to say that being sad all the time is easier because it feels like hell, but I feel lost, not wanting to die has given me so many responsibilities that I wasn‚Äôt ready for and I makes me feel like a helpless child. I‚Äôm still figuring out adulthood because I‚Äôm still young, and having both of those things together makes me want to pause recovery while I figure everything else first, but that would make everything even worse.

And it seems like all the ‚Äúovercoming my eating disorder‚Äù stories online are about people changing their original eating disorder with orthorexiaüôÉ. I know social media isn‚Äôt always real, and they could just fake recovery or be in denial. But even the ‚Äúreal life‚Äù sufferers of anorexia, bulimia, ednos, binging disorder, etc that i know have gone the same path.

At this point I don‚Äôt feel like real recovery isn‚Äôt possible, at least not for the majority of people. A friend made a suggestion of watching content that focused more of drug addiction, but it makes me feel like an impostor. If anyone has a story or tips on how to make it easier or how they have manager to not have a full on relapse (and even if you did, how did you manage to get back on track) I would really appreciate it if you could share it.",1645032258.0

honestly i never thought my self loathing would get to this level. i used to be so good at restricting, i had no binge urges, and lost weight drastically. then i tried to recover last summer, it went ok, but as soon as the school year started i relapsed, however i had unplanned binges a little bit more often. these unplanned binges slowly got more and more common and larger in size , until now i restrict all day and hinge at night. sometimes i try to fast to make up for it, which honestly just makes the whole cycle so much worse. tonight was my 4th night of binging in a row, after i cried off and on all day pleading with myself to just restrict . the thing is - all this binging has brought me back to my pre ed weight and i hate myself and how i look, seriously i‚Äôm overweight. i‚Äôm so upset because i know every time i tell myself i will restrict i know it won‚Äôt last long and any hope i had at loosing weight again would just have me end up gaining more. i‚Äôm so fucking frustrated and i‚Äôm honestly in a worse mental state than before and i feel so trapped. all i want is to restrict and lose weight again. anorexia, literally all i was and all i was good at is now gone, i‚Äôm at a higher weight than ever, and i‚Äôm not anywhere near recovered or even doing recovery. i feel so bad and so lost and like everything i ever think , do, and feel is for nothing. it doesn‚Äôt help that some of my friends struggle from disordered eating and they seem to be so good at not eating , and it makes me miss my old body and old ways even more. i never thought it could get worse than last year, where i was deep in my restriction, but these thoughts are so much worse. i feel worthless and like i couldn‚Äôt possibly have anorexia anymore -something that has been my identity for so long . someone please just tell me i‚Äôm not alone and not going crazy. and honestly it would be nice to talk to someone who feels similar, bc i just feel so invalid rn.",1644979637.0

* i'm taking human anatomy & physio and we're studying the pectoral girdle (scapula/clavicles). today the teacher passed out clavicle bone models and told us to figure out which ones were left/right by *feeling our own collarbones* and matching them up. that was my #1 bodycheck when i was really struggling
* in ap psych we're literally studying hunger hormones (HAHAHA) and the teacher started mentioning examples of eating habits. when she mentioned skipping breakfast like it was a normal thing, i started feeling really guilty for eating that day
* i recently found out that one of my friends secretly runs an ana recovery account on instagram that no one in our friend group knows about (popped up on my explore because the algorithm knows exactly what to show me). i suspected because she was always really thin and giving away food, but now that it's confirmed i feel competitive :(
* i was organizing my desk drawers while thinking about how i haven't weighed myself in a while - suddenly i found an old measuring tape. it was literally a sign.
* the whole coquette / black swan / balletcore / lana del rey  / 2014 tumblr aesthetic is showing up everywhere and i feel like low-rise pants and everything are coming back

Summertime I eat healthier (lots more available produce) go outside and move a lot. Lose the weight. Then fall comes and I‚Äôve lost so much that eating feels like a chore, I‚Äôm always the thinnest in the fall, usually barely eating at all, pure bones up in here.

Maybe emotions pulls into this. I‚Äôm very happy in the summer, so when I‚Äôm feeling well emotionally, I don‚Äôt think I need food to feel good. Fall usually the summertime hype calms down, but I‚Äôm so used to not eating that it feels impossible to start again.

I feel like I have an eating disorder but I have no clue. I grew up in an LDS household where mental health wasn‚Äôt talked about much let alone had any accessible resources. My entire life I‚Äôve been told how skinny I am. I‚Äôve always been underweight for my age and height (I have hyperthyroidism which contributes to this) but I feel like lately it‚Äôs gotten a lot deeper than that. I had my daughter (1.5 female) in 2020. It was an unplanned, unexpected and hard pregnancy. I weighed around 120 before I got pregnant. I was extremely sick and was throwing up 7-9 times a day all throughout my pregnancy. This took a huge mental toll on me. I am a very social person so when I became so sick I could hardly get out of bed I felt very isolated. I became depressed and due to my fear of throwing up I suppressed my appetite. After I gave birth (the baby thankfully came out very healthy) I weighed around 110 lbs. i got postpartum psychosis, which has gotten a lot better but I still get very detailed nightmares. Enough background for now. I currently weigh 92 lbs. i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I am always so tired. I don‚Äôt want to leave me house or socialize. Nothing sounds appetizing, but when I find something that does I eat a ton of it. I‚Äôve tried forcing myself to eat scheduled meals but in the back of my head I have this fear of gaining too much weight. I know it sounds horrible that I‚Äôm afraid of being plus size but I am. I am terrified. But what scared me even more is my daughter growing up and seeing me eat once every other day and thinking thats healthy. What do I do?",1644954686.0

Going back to uni, going out with friends, drinking, diner dates, and the need for energy to go to class and to work has slowly lead me to get back to a normal eating routine. I went through all the ups and downs of the early stages of recovery: trying to eat more but super clean and still low cal, relapsing for a day or two, then binging like crazy, then trying the three meals a day but binging again because my body has been starved for so long. Usually that's where I give up and go back to starving.
I've tried to recover so many times and it always exhausts me after 3 months of efforts so I get back on my bullshit but right now it's been over 5 months and since I eat pretty intuitively and have almost completely ditched the restrictive mind set, I've stopped binging. And the urge to relapse is getting increasingly stronger every day. 

I guess I just need to talk about it somewhere that's why I'm back on this subreddit.

I know I often miss the ""good"" parts of my anorexia (ofc nothing is good about this disorder but ya know what I mean) but it doesn't last long and I force myself to remember why I tried to recover in the first place.

I do not have a diagnosed eating disorder. Rather, 'disordered eating' (in the UK that means, you aren't underweight so we won't help you!).

The most secretive part about my eating is my nightly binge on anything chocolatey. I am so ashamed of this that I've never really told my MH team.

More and more increasingly in the mornings, I am wanting to self harm because it makes me feel so absolutely disgusting.

I've worked so hard on my overall self and physical/mental health but it feels like as soon as I do one thing positive, something else slips. Like I can never get a balance, I'm always going to be desperately trying to manage and keep stable.

some clarity i gained while eating at maintenance for two weeks that helped me and i think might help others,142,ssiaij,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ssiaij/some_clarity_i_gained_while_eating_at_maintenance/,6,"first off, the reason you still feel heavy no matter how much you lose while restricting is bc you literally don‚Äôt have the energy to carry your body around. after a week eating 2k calories, my body actually felt lighter bc i had the strength and energy to carry it. while restricting i always felt dragged down and heavy, and now i know its more to do w how tired and weak i was than the actual weight of my body. maybe that‚Äôs obvious to some ppl but it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt to me. 

another thing is brain fog takes a long time to go away. like weeks. i used to eat normally for a day or two and be pissed bc i still felt like shit. still had no energy and couldn‚Äôt think or see clearly. so then i‚Äôd restrict again bc if i‚Äôm going to feel like shit regardless i might as well just restrict. but after eating regularly for a while i‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs not an overnight thing. you don‚Äôt eat and immediately the fog vanishes. deep into week two i started feeling a lot better bc i could read again and focus on school.

anyways idk if this is helpful to anyone but getting some clarity on things that used to rule my mind has made me feel less scared and confused.",1644865135.0
I'm trying so hard to get better,8,sszyht,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sszyht/im_trying_so_hard_to_get_better/,1,"so TW I'm gonna be mentioning food and weight but not numbers. also some self hatred stuff. this is a rant

anyways, lately I've gotten into intuitive eating and it's been going really well for the most part, I've actually started to look really healthy and I'm getting loads of compliments and also my general quality of life has gone up, (read the book Intuitive Eating guys). but there have obviously been a few little setbacks like there is with all recovery. 
my sibling is aware that I struggle with an ED and I've told them not to give out to me if I accidentally eat something they wanted to keep. I've told them to say it to me once and let me apologize, or to say it in advance. last night they made a bunch of coffee jelly with their friend, like 4 big cups, and didn't tell me not to eat it. I had a tiny bit of one, assuming it was fine. anyways this morning they got so angry at me in front of their friend and I feel so ashamed and disgusted and like I should never eat again. I cut off the tiny bits my spoon could have touched, it was barely anything. but they won't even look at me and I feel so disgusting and I want to never eat again. I know it's bad but maybe it's as revenge almost. I'm trying so so hard and they KNOW that this sabotages me. my ED has created issues in every fucking aspect of my life. it's one of the few things that has led to arguments in my relationship. I just need support because I find recovery so hard, I've struggled w this for so many years. I did my best to fix the jelly afterwards and the friend thanked me and said it looked perfect but god I feel so horrible and piglike. I know I'll be better later but I just hate myself rn",1644920819.0
My story with my ED so far,7,sszo5a,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sszo5a/my_story_with_my_ed_so_far/,0,"I just need somewhere to put this where people will understand so here it is heads up it'll be a bit long

I grew up being told I was ""chubby"" my whole life even when I was a healthy weight for my age, most of this came from my mother. She's an obese woman who still pushes her issues with her own body onto me up to this day. Due to stress and the constant insults from my family I became an emotional eater quite young not to mention even before that my mother overfed me (back when I was young enough that she controlled that sort of stuff)

By the time I was 10 years old I hated my body so much that I tried dieting which of course with the unhealthy mindset I was in led to binging. I'd diet for a week, binge, overeat for weeks until I had a breakdown over my body and then repeat.

This lasted up until I was 12 when I developed a BED and grew to hate my body even more, this was also around the time I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety so it was a tough time. I restricted for awhile before going back to binging and gaining weight.

At 13 was when things went south in my opinion well even worse than they were before, I developed an RED. Slowly but surely my intake went down and I found myself constantly obsessing over the number on the scale. I became addicted to the feeling of control it gave me within a month or so and haven't been able to break the cycle since. I'm disgusted in my body and all I want is to reach my goal but even then deep down I know it won't fix anything. I'll keep saying just 10 more pounds over and over until I'm skin and bone. I'm terrified but other's judging me for recovering at a higher weight scares me even more so I keep going.",1644919550.0
RECOVERY POSTPONED... AGAIN,5,st29g6,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/st29g6/recovery_postponed_again/,0,"Hello everyone,

Just posting to vent atm, kind of at a loss.

Got a call mid yoga session from a home number and was glad to see it was the ED Clinic.

I finally gathered up the courage in December to approach recovery, albeit on the NHS.

I knew it would be slow but my first appointment was at the beginning of January which was to be shortly followed by another assessment at the end of January.

They have postponed my appointments three times already and now both of my appointments with the team are in April. APRIL. FOUR MONTHS LATER.

This feels like such an uphill battle honestly. Four months for my eating disorder to fester. I could literally be dead in four months.

I need some NHS ED success stories please because this is driving me nuts.

I used to be able to eat practically anything and everything without having any problem.

In elementary school, my friend who didn't eat much would make up a disgusting combination of food for me to eat, and I was more than happy to. It honestly didn't matter - food was food. Also, during my binges, which I've been doing all my life (earliest memory is age 5), I'd often eat one thing right after another thing, like peanut butter and olives, and not even notice it.

Growing up, I didn't understand how people struggled with food-eating competitions - I could totally eat that 6lb steak challenge? I could do that 3-person pizza challenge by myself easily? Why do people make it seem so difficult?

Nowadays, that's changed completely. I look at those food challenges, and it is astonishing to me that 1. people do them and 2. I thought that I could do them easily. And now, sometimes, food tastes not so good. And that's ok. Sometimes it is because what I have just is a gross combination of things, and sometimes it is because I'm not in the mood for something.

My roommate accidentally put vanilla oatmilk into her mac-n-cheese recipe, and we just had to try it. It was atrocious. I put pepper in it, and so when I ate it, I got hit with cheese, pepper, and vanilla. I gagged the whole time. It was fun! But mac-n-cheese used to be a huge binge food for me.

Chew/spit rant,10,sst0sf,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sst0sf/chewspit_rant/,14,"I have seen a lot of people post on this subreddit about how they chew and spit often and it's very reassuring but I just want to rant about it.

I was interested one night on how much food I truly chew/spit daily. I decided to count my calories for a few days. No limits or anything, just logging the caloric values of everything I chew/spit those days. And let me say I was very shocked.

Over the span of 4 days I chewed and spit about >!6k-8k calories each day!< worth of food NOT INCLUDING MY BINGES. I don't have a fear of calories that come from my chew/spit food (because there's no way my body has enough time to absorb every single calorie if the food is in my mouth for like 3 seconds before I spit it out), but I was not expecting such a high number.

I actually watch mukbangs and stuff and watching the people on there swallow their food is so weird to me (not to sound high-and-mighty or anything). I used to really enjoy going out to eat but I don't go out anymore unless the place has what I need to successfully chew/spit.

I miss out on a lot of my favorite foods like ice cream and yogurt. I also miss out on a lot of foods that  I need for good health because I find them gross to spit out. Or useless or something. I'm talking about things like fruits and vegetables and, oddly enough, cheese. The idea of seeing spit out cheese in a cup is absolutely disgusting to me. Eating disorders have the weirdest standards for those they effect.

Anyways I want to write about chew/spit binges now. I do it daily. I grab copious amounts of food, >!definitely thousands of calories worth!< , to put in my mouth for a bit and spit it out right after. I don't even know why. Odd how I'm okay with chewing/spitting such a large amount of food in one sitting but afraid to swallow vegetables! 

Lost all of my hobbies and friends to it as well.

Let me end this post by saying that if you haven't started DON'T!! Obviously. It is not a good habit at all and if I could go back in time to tell myself all of this I would.

now i can't even stay in voicechat with him for more than 2 hours before my ED urges me to go watch or read ED related stuff for hours on end.


i wanted to spend more time with him for valentine's day, but i've had just a few hours ago my first """"""binge"""""" since my relapse (in big quotation marks because it's nothing near the true binging i experienced in recovery as it was just a bunch of lettuce with cheese slathered on.)


and well, the self hatred fueled me to run around my room for 2 hours straight. long story short, i couldn't call him earlier than usual and won't even turn my cam on as planned because i'm too exhausted to make myself look less miserable.

Please dont feel obligated to read and I‚Äôm sorry if this is a stupid post.  I just really lack perspective, im so deep into this and im struggling to see any hope for my life :(

I‚Äôve had anorexia and a running addiction since i was 15/16, i turn 20 this year. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years but I‚Äôve relapsed 6 times, like hard relapse getting worse every time. I started uni this past fall and moved out, uni has been my lifelong dream and i looked forward to making memories and partying bc i never did that in HS due to my ED. But i relapsed, worse than ever, got a little better over christmas, and relapsed again this january, hard. I dont know what i weigh exactly, but i know its atleast in the >! 14s maybe 13s if i listen to what others have said i ‚Äúlook‚Äù like !< ,and not knowing my weight leads it to be very hard for me to see any severity in my illness

However this past week my chest has been acting up again, it did this last fall too when i was rly bad (i used to be afraid to sleep). Ive had pain in my left chest area (not directly in the heart tho). Theres also a like ‚Äúmuscle pulling‚Äù feeling around my left chest/breast aswell. I also have fatigue, sometimes stomach ache, and had pain in my left shoulder blade. All of this did kinda scare me bc i learnt heart failure can show symptoms in women pretty far in advance. At the same time, i dont even know my weight, i could be fine.

I got so scared that i started to eat, ive eaten >! 1700 !< for three days now. I feel like ive overreacted and like i was actually fine and now ive just gained for no reason. 

At the same time, im throwing away my life, i had plans to study abroad but u need to pass a health check and i prbly wont. Im also nearly failing school bc its so hard to keep up when im malnourished. I also get injured super easily in my workouts etc and im scared of osteoporosis bc i havent had my period since 15. 

Idk i shift so much between just wanting to say fuck it and recover, like i have moments where im afraid ill die, but then i have moments where i feel a bit better, and im convinced im fine

I can't tell if I have an eating disorder. Should I go talk to someone?,0,ssoyz9,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ssoyz9/i_cant_tell_if_i_have_an_eating_disorder_should_i/,2,"I'm a 5"" female weighing 47kg (which is roughly 103.6 pounds (so I think that makes me ""average"" weight?)

Since the first lockdown in 2020, I've started exercising regularly. Initially, I will admit I started exercising to get my body to look a certain way but I don't think I was ever ""obsessed"" with how I looked too much and eventually exercise just became a nice mental break.

There was a phase a few months ago where I was eating salads and not snacking at all every single day but I stopped because I started getting a bit light headed when I was walking around places and it seemed to be making my periods feel more worse than usual.

Recently, I've noticed that I have been eating a lot more than usual. I'm snacking tonnes when I'm not hungry to the point where sometimes I feel a bit too full. Sometimes I snack when less people are around so I tend to snack a lot at home. But then I'll just think to myself that I'll exercise it all off later.

I've started ramping up how much exercise I do to about an hour and a half a day and have added cardio into it too. Today was the first day in weeks that I've skipped a day of exercise and I feel a bit guilty about it. But I've never felt overly tired from exercise the next day etc. so I'm not sure if I'm exercising a normal amount or more.

I used to look in the mirror maybe once a day at my calves, upper arms and stomach. But I've noticed I've been checking my body every time I go past the mirrors in my house and any pictures my friends take of me, I could spend ages just looking at my body in it (and I have done).

I'm kind of frustrated at myself because if I were a friend, I would never in a million years think this about them. And I would tell them they look just fine the way they are and that it's personality and health that matters the most. I am upset at myself that I can't believe it when it comes to myself.

I know I can't get diagnosed on here, but does this potentially sound like something more serious than just low self-esteem? And do you think I might need to talk to anyone about it?",1644883325.0

And it‚Äôs been getting worse. 

And Then you have the subs who are all about calling that out, but they also jump on your back if you say something they don‚Äôt like. 

I‚Äôm so tired of there not being a middle ground. I‚Äôm tired of people saying extended fasting is totally healthy, and seeing highly upvoted before and afters going from normal weight to underweight and being praised. I‚Äôm tired of ppl cutting to the lowest they can and being praised for discipline. I‚Äôm tired of people acting like you‚Äôre making stupid choices if you get hungry on a deficit, that it‚Äôs only about volume of food and I need to just bulk up my foods with cauliflower or soemthing. I‚Äôm tired of people acting like you‚Äôre gonna die immediately if you‚Äôre overweight or obese and you need to quickly cut down as fast as you can, get on keto, start intermittent fasting, and lift all day every day.

But you know what I‚Äôm also tired of? People saying that the BMI is complete bullshit and disregard it. Yeah the BMI is flawed, but don‚Äôt tell me that I don‚Äôt need to pay attention to where I fall and what my optional range it. Don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs completely useless, and that most people are so fit or muscular they cant use it as a guideline.

It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúdanger‚Äù meter. It‚Äôs very easy to accidentally go one way or the other, because underweight and obese are not as always as extreme as people think. 

I‚Äôm tired of being told that eating what I eat, even under the advice of multiple medical professionals, is going to bring back my disordered eating and make me worse.

I‚Äôm so fucking tired of it. This sub is probably the only place I feel comfortable talking about it, and then I‚Äôm probably gonna have people judging for it. How fucked is it that the only place I feel comfortable talking about this is an eating disorder (support) sub?

I‚Äôm tired of one side pretending that it‚Äôs a moral failing and there‚Äôs something wrong with you and you don‚Äôt deserve good things if you‚Äôre fat or obese, and I‚Äôm also tired of the other side pretending you can be healthy at any size and that you‚Äôll never have to cut calories to lose weight, and if you do, you‚Äôre in denial.

I‚Äôm tired of being accused of ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äú for acknowledging as a shorter woman who is largely sedentary, I have to be more strict about watching my calories than other people because my margin of error is very small. I‚Äôm just so tired of being dogpiled and yelled at but I‚Äôm just trying to talk about myself when I‚Äôm just trying to get support or voice my support for others. I‚Äôm tired of people pretending that they know everything about me from a small snippet of my life BMI, and telling me that they know better than my medical professionals. Especially when the same women who are like ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm your height and I eat double to triple what you eat/your tdee, then when you ask them what their ‚Äúnon-active‚Äù lifestyle is, they tell you they walk multiple miles a day, lift heavy 3 to 4 times a week, and work an active job that has them on their feet all day. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶?????? Of course you! That‚Äôs way more activity than I get every day???

This tightrope I have to walk of not giving into my disordered eating but also making sure I am losing weight healthy and sustainably and trying to balance healthy behaviors without going overboard is incredibly hard. it‚Äôs almost unbearable when you have people on both sides jumping on me telling me ‚Äúoh you need to do more of it‚Äù or ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre going to get fucked up and start eating disorder again.

It‚Äôs like no‚Ä¶ I am painfully aware of my reality and how tenuous of a journey this is. I feel like no one understands how hard it is to be overweight as a short woman who has a past of disordered eating but also seriously needs to lose weight for her health.

Of my weight. Why tf else would I do things like restrict and compensate for eating if I wasn't trying to control my weight. 

But also...that's so vague and unhelpful. Wtf does ""control"" even mean?? It's not (at least for me) about ~control~ in general. Like, I don't feel out of control in any other part of my life. If I just desired to control something then I could have chosen to control literally any other aspect of my life. I could control the clothes I wear, or my hair, or idk the way I arrange the stuff on my desk. But no, I control FOOD and my WEIGHT, the two most difficult things to control. Why the FUCK would I choose these incredibly uncontrollable things if I just wanted control and stability in my life?? 

And also, it's clear when they say ""control"" they're not referring to control of specifically weight, because ""it's about control"" is almost always accompanied with a line like ""it's totally not about weight. It was never about the weight, it's deeper than that, they desire CONTROL"" when wtf YES IT IS ABOUT THE WEIGHT, and at the same time yes, it is also deeper than that, but why do you hesitate so damn much to acknowledge that for some people it IS about the weight?? 

For some it's nothing about control, they just want to be skinny. It could also be a coping mechanism, or an addiction. There are so many other ways to conceptualize an eating disorder other than the ""control"" narrative but I don't see any of them as popularized as this one!!

I just feel like the reason this ""control"" narrative gets pushed so often is because people don't want to acknowledge that some people have eating disorders purely because they want to be skinny. Because caring about weight and your physical appearance is seen as vain, and people don't want vanity to be the reason for developing a serious disorder.

But I'd argue that it's not fucking vain to want to control your weight, especially in the groups of people who have the highest rates of EDs! For actors/actresses, singers, certain athletes, kpop idols, and women in general, being at a lower weight is legitimately important. Women notice they're treated better when they're thinner. Celebrities get more attention, which translates to more money, when they're thinner and perceived as more attractive. Gymnasts, dancers, wrestlers are constantly pressured to control their weight to achieve an ideal body for their sport. Being at a certain weight is directly linked to positive outcomes (success, money, respect) and wanting these things is not vain!! And since the stakes of not being able to maintain a low weight are so high for these people, it is absolutely reasonable for this to cause intense anxiety to the point of developing an eating disorder. For some people not being skinny/attraticelve could literally ruin their life, get them fired from their jobs, cost them future opportunities, etc. Caring about their weight is NOT vain at all.

I just feel like pushing this narrative that EDs are vaguely about a desire for ~control~ instead of diving into the deeper societal pressures that contribute to the development of an ED is actually harmful. It minimizes legitimate anxieties and it causes shame for people who feel like they don't fit into this ""desire for control"" narrative.

It sounds like people want to legitimize EDs by treating it like idk a physical illness or something that just manifests by itself, and don't want to acknowledge that EDs can happen for a reason, because they think that reason is vain. When it's not.

And idk I could be reaching here, but I feel like the pushing of this ""EDs are about a desire for control"" explanation stems from a general delegitimization of  anxieties that mostly impact women. As in, people think that feeling anxiety and insecurity over your weight (which is a problem that women commonly deal with) is seen as ""not a real problem"" and therefore not a ""good enough"" reason for the development of an eating disorder.

Potential bf triggered my unhealthy eating habits and rituals,4,ss2lc5,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ss2lc5/potential_bf_triggered_my_unhealthy_eating_habits/,6,"I think this guy who I‚Äôm talking to triggered my bad eating habits and rituals.

But overall I think the comments he said about bodies that have the same size as me triggered it. I have had occasions where I have it unhealthy eating habits and rituals, but not as bad as this. 

He has made comments when we were friends. I got jealous of this girl who he was friends with. He said how he would be never attracted this to girl, because she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo tall and too fat‚Äù. I asked what‚Äôs her height and he said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs like 5‚Äô6‚Äù. I‚Äôm around that height as well and it made me feel so shit and manly in a way. Even though it‚Äôs average height especially my age and my race. I‚Äôm ultra feminine and hate being ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù because it makes me feel shit. There‚Äôs nothing wrong being flamboyant or masculine, it‚Äôs just who I am and what I am (can‚Äôt really change that). On another occasion I told him I‚Äôm a size 8 in shoe sizes (US). He said how size US 8 shoes are big for a women and proceeded to say sizes US 5-6 shoe size is average. It might be true, but what I said before I don‚Äôt like when I feel masculine in any shape and makes me feel not feminine and not attractive in a way. It makes me shit and makes me feel manly. I remember one time when my friend said to me she wishes she was my height (she is around 5‚Äô0) and I was flattered. He said to her ‚ÄúI prefer short girls‚Äù. Which made me feel so shit about myself, especially when someone compliments me and then someone saying how ‚Äúit‚Äôs unattractive physical trait‚Äù in my subconscious...

So my brain tells me I should be at least bmi 17 to feel feminine and small, so I won‚Äôt be seen as masculine. The thing is he is a great guy, I do love him very much. But those comments in the past really triggered my really bad eating habits. What confuses me even more is he says I‚Äôm very petite and stuff. But my subconscious tells me about the other comments he‚Äôs said in the past.

The thing is he knows I‚Äôve had moments when I wouldn‚Äôt eat a proper meal a day for a month.

last week I somewhat recovered but I'm now having chest pain, extreme fatigue, faintness, bodyaches, etc.  

my mom is in the medical field and she thinks it's Anemia. i'm going to the doctor at the end of the week but it's going to be hard because if they ask me about my symptoms and when they started, I don't really know what to say

because when I wasn't eating, I would have heart palpitations a lot and get really dizzy and almost pass out. But that's pretty normal for an ED. So I don't know if I should tell them about that because it might not relate to the overall issues I'm having at all really. Like I don't think it was caused by anemia.

so yeah I just don't know how to bring up my symptoms besides for the ones that been happening this week because I feel like everything else was caused by malnutrition. like I was losing a ton of hair which is a symptom of anemia but it's also just a symptom of EDS. 

it's just really hard because I can't distinguish what was me being malnourished and what might be an overall disorder. But I don't wanna get misdiagnosed because of all my crazy symptoms I had from my ED

I've been working hard on recovery since before we got together and have taken some pretty big steps! I guess I would say I'm mostly recovered at this point. But I do sometimes have days when I don't eat enough or have negative feelings about my body, nothing like I used to but it can happen.

My partner gets really upset every time this happens. Earlier today, I was feeling a bit down about my body, just not feeling attractive or whatever. I didn't say anything but she could tell something was wrong and kept asking about it until I admitted basically I was feeling down about myself. She got pretty upset saying I'm wasting the day, making her feel anxious, taking for granted the good things in my life.

However, this is a kind of rant about my experience I guess?? 

I feel like I see so many posts about how their ED gives them a sense of control but I feel like I just can‚Äôt relate? 

My ED doesn‚Äôt make me feel in control, it makes me feel more out of control if anything. The constant chant of food and making it to the next meal or day seems more like torture than any sort of control. 

I hate restricting, it doesn‚Äôt give me any sort of sense of accomplishment and I hate every moment of it - but it seems necessary to lose weight and that‚Äôs why I stay trapped in the cycle.

I love food. It‚Äôs one of the only things making me happy, and that‚Äôs sad. I find myself rewarding restricting behaviours with a treat because it‚Äôs the only way to get me to stay somewhat on track.

I hate the anxiety I feel whenever I eat and I hate the hatred whenever I feel like since wasted food but god do I also love to let go sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had a weekend lately where I don‚Äôt eat to the point I convince myself I‚Äôve gone up 2 pounds or so. I love eating and not caring if I‚Äôve gone up weight because it‚Äôs the only time I feel happy. It‚Äôs even more satisfying if I come home to see that I haven‚Äôt gained any weight. 

I hate the scale and I hate the fact that it makes me restrict more than necessary because of the daily fluctuations. I also hate that I can‚Äôt stop weighing myself. however, I also hate the crippling anxiety I get whenever it‚Äôs not in my vicinity and I fear that I‚Äôve gained weight. but the feeling of not being able to weigh myself on the weekends is also intoxicating.

I struggle to understand what I‚Äôd be without my eating disorder if I also feel like it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me holding on even if it‚Äôs also the thing that‚Äôs drowning me.

My own twisted source of happiness that‚Äôs slowly killing me.

He was like omg yeah you‚Äôre right and we walked over and he was like, want me to pull a S and a M for you? And I know in my rational brain that he probably just has no clue about women‚Äôs sizing and it‚Äôs easier to pull something off a rack or order it online than it is to pull it off a dressed mannequin but in my ED brain I was triggered to no end. In that moment I just wanted to go home so I told my fianc√© I wanted to leave and we did.  Walking out I explained to him what happened and how I was feeling and he encouraged me to go back inside and finish shopping, citing my rational brain‚Äôs suspicions - that the employee‚Äôs words had less to do with my body or his perception of it and more to do with laziness or ignorance.

trouble eating day before/day of having sex??,7,srunws,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/srunws/trouble_eating_day_beforeday_of_having_sex/,9,"hey everyone. im currently trying to wean myself off calorie counting and restricting, but... im having trouble feeling desirable unless i heavily restrict the day before/day of having sex with my current FWB. i have REALLY prominent horizontal red lines on my stomach when im full (partially from slouching lol...) and since i usually hang out with this person/have sex at night, when bodies looks their roughest from an entire day of action, i feel so fucking ugly :( 

he's really vocal about loving my stomach (and my bit of chub which for some reason he really likes, and that's another thing im trying to learn, that porn bodies arent realistic and that desire isnt that simplistic) but i just feel so gross and cant get myself out of this sick mindset that skinnier = more attractive

if anyone else is sexually active and is recovering please send tips my way!!! all i want is to enjoy super bowl sunday and eat some damn pizza, but i cant stop thinking about looking fat tomorrow when i see himüò≠üò≠

"Gain a small bit of weight and suddenly everyone wants to talk about their ""problems gaining weight"" or ""problems eating enough"" with you. Or the conversation just turns body focused for no reason.",22,srki8y,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/srki8y/gain_a_small_bit_of_weight_and_suddenly_everyone/,0,"So my ED can sometimes be weight based, sometimes it's more like orthorexia, and a few times I have been physically ill and just lost weight. Anyway, I tend to get very ill from restricting, if I take it too far, for whatever reason. And coming out of it I have to slowly let go of behaviors and thoughts etc. around food, and for me that means eating before I get faint and shakey, and kinda giving up a lot of control.

My last weird episode with food, I ended up so afraid of it (was having weird effects from it due to physical illness) that I would put off eating til I was completely shaking and heart racing, and felt like I would die. I would literally get to that limit before I would eat, every day.  
 And yeah, I lost weight, but I literally felt like I was going to die like three times a day before I would eat and stop my body  freaking out. ANYWAY, so recently I've just been kinda eating freely ish, three meals etc. without letting myself get super shaky and ill first, eating a bit of sugar again, maybe overeating sometimes, but nothing crazy. But I have put on a few kgs, i'm not overweight, but I guess a noticeable amount.  Also, I put on weight on my legs more than my waist and stomach, but I don't wear tight fitted tops, so I feel people think I've put on more than I have.   


So anyway again, WHY DO PEOPLE SUDDENLY NEED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THEIR WEIGHT??? It's driving me crazy, it's happened before as well. This time, with an acquaintance/friend ish person, it was like they couldn't hold it in. Like they see you, and they can't wait to flaunt the fact that you are heavier, and they are thin. Like ""I just can't gain weight"" I honestly don't even remember how they managed to shoehorn this into the conversation tbh. Like, first off, it's humble bragging that they ""can't gain weight,"" it's literally just a ""socially acceptable"" way to point out you are thin. And second  they could, they just don't eat much, and likely on purpose.

I've known a  couple of people who would literally eat whatever and would eat a lot and didn't gain weight, and you can just tell, there's a certain look and they tend not to have a slightly starved look about them and actually quite high energy levels, and also they NEVER talked about it.

So anyway, I'm fine with this person being thin, good for them, great if what you're doing works for you and you are able to function and be healthy. I'm currently trying to break out of extreme habits that were making me ill, so can I have some space please? I've done this before, and my weight tends to settle eventually. But like when I'm trying to get better and not fucking die, why do I need these vampires at me like this, literally pouncing on the opportunity to make themselves feel better than me.

Also they started talking about their stomach, and how that's the one spot they have etc. And I'm like, ok, what do I say, oh yeah my stomach is actually fine, I never gain weight there. I should've, since it was apparently a competition. But really, I don't want to talk about bodies or weight, like AT ALL. And I don't want to make people feel like shit. If she was suffering from health problems, or the can't gain weight thing was true, I would be fine to talk about it. But it was literally only because I've put on weight that she even said it. It makes me dislike people. Like, great, I feel fucking disgusting and humiliated now, thanks for bringing that up. It really fucking helped our relationship, and humanity as a whole to have this conversation.

And also, they say it's only your ED makes you think everyone is watching your weight, and then people act like this???Or is it, that they want you to explain yourself? Like here is the story of why I am not as thin as I was last time I saw you.... Like I don't understand????",1644764529.0

I've gained a significant amount in the last 2 years from could but most in the last year and a half due to an injury. I'm currently 70lbs overweight but working on it. 

However I've found in recent weeks I've been so bad mentally. Like, restricting and pruging bad. Heavy restricting when I step on the scale and I've ONLY lost 5lbs in a week bad. 
 
I've tried to tell my friends what's going on because they've noticed my behaviour changing, and they act like they care, but when I start talking about how I feel like I'm spiraling out of control in my ED they tune out and ignore it. One of my ""best friends"" has recently dropped some weight. About 20lbs in 6 months. I met her after I started gaining weight so she hasn't seen me smaller in person, only in photos. However she has been around for the last year or so of the more rapid weight gain, and has made several comments about me putting on a lot of weight. I've told her about my ED issues and how I'm struggling and again, she acts like she cares but then completely brushes it off. I tell her I wish my scale would budge and I feel like I'm losing it and she berates me and says to throw my scale away because numbers are irrelevant. I tell her that when I don't know my weight I constantly feel like I'm getting heavier so I stop eating completely. Like to the point where my clothes could literally swallow me whole but if I don't know by the numbers on the scale that I've lost weight I will convince myself I'm rapidly gaining. 

She said the numbers are irrelevant and don't matter and I need to ditch the scale because it's bullshit. She then goes in and on about her 20lb weight loss and how she LOVES that when she gets on the scale at the doctor he compliments her for getting healthier and how she loves that she's wearing smaller jeans and below the 200s. I'm happy for her and I constantly tell her that, I support her and I think she's doing great but I just wish she could return the support and be a friend. 

I have another one of my ""best friends"" who when I explained I had dropped 20lbs in a month from just not eating and working out, and that I felt out of control and exhausted ans sick all of the time said that ""but that's good because you needed to lose weight so keep doing that"".

I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm spiraling and I have 0 support. I know I need to quit bad habits but it's so hard not to be on one extreme, especially when no one believes I have an ED because I'm fat.

As for girls, our societal requisite is to eat less and do a lot of cardio, as for guys it's just to be as muscular and lean as possible. Not trying to compare the 2, but statistically more girls struggle with Eating Disorders. I don't even know what I'm saying. I feel lost. And every time I binge I feel so lethargic..

At the Thanksgiving party I ate my plate, 380 calories to be exact. It was 7pm and my only meal OTD (not that he knew that) but I thought that in general it was a normal sized portion and definitely small compared to others'.
He comments on how much I eat, like ""dang you eat more than me"" and laughed (he had 2 HUGE plates tho) and when I went to fix a plate for home (which everyone did) he just scowled and said ""damn, you still eatin?"" Without humor in his tone.

Today we all grouped up to celebrate a birthday and for 3 hours I say there conversing and before I left and cupcakes were offered, I reached for one and he looks at me aghast and said ""damn, are you like a fat person on the inside?""

??????

Homie I am a clearly underweight-appearing grown ass woman. eating a  cupcake or full plate of food is not gonna harm me in any way, and regardless of your opinion, you have no right to police my food, especially not in front of our group??

When he reached for a cupcake after a 3 lb burrito and quesadilla I said the same fat person comment to him and then said ""it doesn't feel so nice to hear food comments on the receiving end now does it?""

full or not is it better too eat or not? i rly dont know.

Anyways, I feel kind of manic rn, because the starving is coming so easy to me, and yet I am worried that mentally I will crack any minute now because I'm starting to feel paranoid and uneasy due to being up for days.

Right now she‚Äôs a heavier weight and she was telling me how uncomfortable she is and that she felt so much better and confident when she was skinny. She also mentioned that when she was skinnier I made a comment that she always told me she hadnt eaten (usually in the afternoon), and she said she had no idea she was doing that.

I never bring up these conversations first and I‚Äôm careful to choose my words and not say anything triggering. She does not do the same for me. 

I hate it. I can‚Äôt stand it when she starts talking about it and I‚Äôve told her before I don‚Äôt like to talk about it. I don‚Äôt know what her goal is when she has conversations like that with me. 

I already feel a competition vibe and I HIGHLY doubt me admitting to any kind of eating disorder would remedy that. I think it would make things worse. I just want my friendship to be normal and not centered around eating issues or eating disorders, is that like a crazy thing for me to think? 

When she‚Äôs skinnier she makes other comments too that are hinting at how skinny she had gotten etc(strikes me as bragging but I might just be triggered). once she even pointed out a girl that was skinnier than me and it‚Äôs like.... ok? Like... literally what is the point of that... is that supposed to make me feel good or bad or what? 

I don‚Äôt know. I just hate it. And I‚Äôve been gaining weight recently so her talking about how much better she feels skinny just makes me feel bad too because I feel the same way but I‚Äôve been trying not to let ED thoughts get the better of me.

Will I go back to my pre-ED weight?,9,sqxbmn,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sqxbmn/will_i_go_back_to_my_preed_weight/,0,"My ED started when I was already an adult, and I had been maintaining a healthy, normal weight for my entire adult life.

Now I'm in recovery and I'm just ever so slightly below that weight. Climbing back to that number (or at least to the highest number that I ever remember reaching - I wouldn't weigh myself very often) already scares me so much. But it's not the weight itself; I can tolerate it. What really scares me is, not having a ""safety buffer"" anymore, not being able to stop eating once I'm there and just keeping gaining and gaining and gaining weight. My problem is that right now I'm still eating so much - not nearly the amounts I was eating in early recovery during my phase of uncontrollable extreme hunger, but still much more than a normal person would. And so I think I'll reach that weight soon.

Most of my family members are around that weight, or at least have a similar appearance. 

Honestly, I would be okay with going back to that weight, and staying there. I don't really care about being underweight anymore as long as I can eat freely and not balloon up. But there are no guarantees that it will actually happen and I don't know what to do - I don't wanna reach that weight and then be forced to restrict again just to maintain. Not only would it be miserable, but I'd also relapse pretty much immediately.

***!!!!TW: mentioning/describing eating behaviour and I wrote one number (in spoiler tags)!!!!***

I live alone and can freely decide what food goes into my fridge (and can control myself perfectly when going grocery shopping) and I set myself a daily limit of >!500cals!<. I created this list of food, basically I will only buy/eat what's on that list, I am not sure if 'safe food' is the correct term for this list, I am kinda new to all the terms being used in these topics. The problem I have is that I tend to binge on certain foods, which I hate, that's why I am adjusting the list, if I binge once on a food it gets removed from the list, therefore a lot of stuff that I really love like fruits or certain veggies aren't on that list even though they're low cal (for example bell pepper, tomatoes, cheese, all fruits). So basically everything on my list is food that I only like moderately in terms of taste or that I know I won't binge on for specific reasons. Is this a common thing? Like only eating stuff that doesn't taste too good so it's easier to stay in the calorie limit? It's not that I only eat stuff that I absolutely hate, if I had to rate the taste of all the foods on my list, they would all be between 4 and 7 out of 10, nothing that absolutely disgusts me in terms of taste (like ginger, beer, olives, loquorice etc.) but also nothing that I'd die for (like pasta, chocolate, fruits, pizza etc.)

Example of the last thing I removed from my list:
>!Babybel Cheese, I was really trying to find some cheese that I won't binge on, it worked out for a few days with Babybel but now I binged the ones I had left and went over my calorie limit, so I am not buying them again.!<

My current food list for a bit more context:
>!some special type of wholewheat crispbread, rice cakes, mustard, chinese cabbage, iceberg lettuce, cucumber, chicory, romaine lettuce, courgette/zucchini, cabbage turnip, onions, potatoes, mushrooms and technically pickles but I am currently doubting them, might remove soon. Additionally I take several supplements to help against the lack of nutritional stuff and I am always looking for more stuff to add to the list so I get a better variety of food.!<",1644712325.0

Partner is on a diet and it's triggering.,8,sqrtbd,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sqrtbd/partner_is_on_a_diet_and_its_triggering/,1,"Sooo, this is my first post on Reddit, like, ever, so I am sorry if I'm doing anything wrong here! Also, English is not my first language, so sorry again for any mistakes!

To add a little background: I've been with my partner for 10 years now, and sometime during that time, stress at work made me develop Anorexia. I managed to keep it secret from him for three years (aka only eating when he's around, saying weight loss was ""unintentional"" etc...), and so he only found out when I started my recovery two years ago and I told him. We fought about food and body image a lot because he isn't the most sensitve person on the planet which usually is fine with me, but sometimes I would've needed more support than he managed to give me. When he was trying to lose weight shortly after I started recovery, it resulted in a huge disagreement, but he agreed on trying to not let me know when he's on a diet and to eat normally whenever he's around me. Shortly after, he started eating normally again anyway bc his strict diet just wasn't sustainable.

Now, he started dieting again. He's trying not to let me know and he didn't tell me about it directly. But I saw him logging his calories in an app while we were eating and he accidentally held his phone in an angle where I could see.  He also made nasty comments about his body, which is triggering to me, as well.

Now, I know I can't tell him what to do about his body, and him counting calories is his choice. But it's triggering for me anyway. I don't even know why exactly, because it's not my body, it's not my business, but since I saw that bloody app, it feels like having a knot in my stomach whenever I'm trying to eat anything. 

I tried to talk to him about Intuitive Eating and HAES  (which btw helped me LOTS), but he just said that he ""didn't believe"" in those concepts, and that ""even if I were healthy at every size, I still wouldn't like the way I look."". 

Does anybody have any advice for me? I don't want to break off a fight because I know I'm not in a position to be telling him what to do with his body, but  I don't want to relapse and be triggered whenever I look at him, either!",1644673268.0

Blood Sugar / Hypoglycemia issues? Please help anxiety bad,4,sqv1r1,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sqv1r1/blood_sugar_hypoglycemia_issues_please_help/,3,"Hello,

I am a 31 y/o 5'8"" 134lb male who has been battling anorexia for about 4 years now. I've unintentionally lost a few pounds over the last 6 months after being at an all time high weight(148lbs)/starting to feel better. I've been pushing myself too hard in the gym and a lot of movement at work.

I have been eating a significant amount of calories this whole time. I eat about 2500-2800 everyday. I am getting basic blood work done today (unfortunately not my A1C or glucose - just basic RBC,WBC etc). to see what is going on. I was diagnosed Anemic 2.5 years ago deep into my E/D.

I've been battling what feels like hypoglycemia and severe anxiety the last 2-3 days. I had these symptoms a couple of weeks ago but it went away. I am getting hard body crashes about 1-2 hours after eating. Extreme fatigue, irritability, dizziness confusion etc. I have noticed some sugar seems to bring me right back to momentarily. The other night I was not near food and went about an hour with these conditions. I immediately consumed a very large piece of dessert cake and felt like I was going to pass out. Extreme chills, shaking, jitters which lasted about 20-30 minutes. This was my wake up call something really isn't right.

I am scared and will do WHATEVER it takes to fix these issues. No more gym. Massive amounts of food (going to aim for 3500+). I am going to find another doctor on Monday to test my A1C etc. Has anyone had issues with their blood sugar? Were you able to fix it during weight restoration/recovery?

I decided to ask for help and initially thought I was going to be taken seriously. My dad gave me a hug and didn't say much more (he and I have a very rocky relationship) and my mother was upset. My parents put me in therapy. In therapy I didn't click with my therapist and she made me feel really guilty. My situation didn't improve and she tried to have me go inpatient at renfrew. This didn't go well as it was extremely expensive and my dad invalidated my eating disorder and I could tell he thought I was being dramatic. My mom said that I could go if I tell everyone I know what was wrong and with my anxiety it terrified me to make a status about this or tell everyone in my classes at school. Therefore, I decided not to go renfrew and quit therapy. I told my mom I would stop doing this. A little after quitting, my mom would check on me but over time I think everyone forgot. I also would lie and say that I was fine. 
 I have been reflecting a lot lately because bulimia mixed with my depression has really fucked with my teeth. I have my first root canal next week. I also have now had an eating disorder for over a decade. I just wish I could be normal and not have the urges I do. I have a really great relationship with my mom now but I wish she would have taken this more seriously when I was a kid. As for my dad, he isn't really in my life very often.

I am currently in tears and I just really need to rant,7,sqmceh,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sqmceh/i_am_currently_in_tears_and_i_just_really_need_to/,3,"Hi so I don't even know if i have a fricking ed or not but I starve myself, binge, and sometimes make myself throw up, so that's great I guess. Anyways lately I have been getting a bit better and have made a new routine where I let myself eat 1500 calories a day 7 times in two weeks. The rest of the time I just eat one small bowl of whatever my family made for dinner or one small dinner bowl plus 300 calories of something throughout the day. I know it's way too much but please don't judge me, I'm trying. Family dinner times are my absolute worst nightmare and I fricking hate them because I don't know the calories and have to (over)estimate. It's especially bad on 1500 days because I know I'm eating much less than I could be, but I'm so terrified of underestimating cals. Today was a 1500 day and I somehow managed to manipulate my family's dinner so we were having individually portioned homemade pizzas. I even went with my mum to the shops to pick out the ingredients and I made sure we got the lowest calorie options. I was in the kitchen alone at first when we started making them, so I could weigh everything out and finally know how many calories I was eating for once in my life! I weighed everything out and made my pizza, then went back to my room to add up the calories. *Guess what had happened when I came back.* My mum had put **so much more** **fricking mozzarella** on my perfect pizza. I burst into tears pretty much straight away and I couldn't tell my mum because obviously. I was so mad about everything and especially at myself for leaving the room while my food was unattended. I had to then make a **whole new pizza** while she was in the kitchen and I couldn't weigh anything because she was there. I put so much less of everything on just to be safe and it was so bloody infuriating. So now my pizza is probably going to be overestimated by a couple hundred calories. I know no one is going to read this but I'm just looking for a place to rant where people can relate. **eff my effing life.**",1644652552.0

This week has been so mentally draining as I‚Äôve been stressed academically and mentally. The stupid disordered thoughts have been so strong this past week and I haven‚Äôt been able to restrict like I usually do when I become stressed. 

All week I‚Äôve been looking forward to eating a smoothie bowl with almond butter Saturday morning (tomorrow) as a way to mentally cope and have something to look forward to. 

Smoothie bowls are such a comfort food despite being so high cal and the only time I allow myself to have them is on weekends when I feel like I‚Äôve ‚Äúearned‚Äù them. 

Any type of nut butter is also such a huge fear food so I just thought incorporating it into a safe food would make it easier. 

And now this, I don‚Äôt have almond butter and my parents won‚Äôt drive me to get some, so it won‚Äôt be as pleasing so there‚Äôs no point to eating it tomorrow.

So:

For background, I have followed Keto+OMAD for a couple of years now. After having a sizable (not total binge) dinner at a buffet place, I decided to fast. I went for 62 hours (2.5 days). I continued to do dance training as per usual for the 2 days (\~3 hours per day). Not once was I tempted to eat; I was not hungry at all. However, I did get colder the longer I fasted. At the 60 hour mark, I noticed my nailbeds starting to turn purple. I also slept in my down jacket the night before (the night of the 2nd day, so \~12 hours before I broke my fast). The only reason I broke at 2.5 days instead of 3.5 days was that my new OCD meds made me so nauseuous I couldn't see straight. But even when I did eat, I only eat till I wasn't nauseous- no cravings at all. Same for today- I just had a bowl of fish soup in the morning, a latte, and that's it. No hunger whatsoever. Including buffet food weight, I lost \~5lbs (\~2.5kg) in 2 days. Is what I described normal? Or are my hunger signals completely broken?",1644656376.0

Moments that fed my ed,6,sqch6p,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sqch6p/moments_that_fed_my_ed/,1,"- my brother telling everyone when I hit 100lbs and using that in arguments with me. Whenever I‚Äôd say something, his comeback would be something like ‚Äúno one will like you because you‚Äôre over 100lbs‚Äù

- my mom being a dietitian and never really letting me have any snack foods besides 100 calorie packs. This has led to a complete inability to exercise self control around foods that I didn‚Äôt get to have as a child (whipped cream, fast food, any candy, ice cream, Oreos, popcorn just to name a few)

- my mom getting mad at me when she would find snack wrappers hidden in various places around the house without realizing it was because of my internalized shame and me developing an extremely unhealthy relationship with food.

- my mom being shocked and telling me that we need to ‚Äúdo something about‚Äù me going from a size 4 to a size 6 in pants in high school

- my mom trying to incentivize me to lose weight with money. I was 180lbs and she and I agreed that my goal weight should be 140lbs and she told me she‚Äôd set aside $10/lb that I lost, which if I got to 140, that would mean she‚Äôd give me $400 as a reward for my weight loss

- my mom complaining about her weight and her body and her build in front of me when she weighs less than me and tells me that we‚Äôre built the same way (short, stocky, no waist)

- my parents complimenting me for getting back into being healthy after I go on an excessively long run as a punishment

- my parents asking if I lost weight and complimenting how I looked when I was at the peak of my ed

- my childhood best friend who is obsessed with the gym telling me daily about how life changing the gym can be after I told her about the anxiety that it brings me

- my parents lecturing me that it‚Äôs bad to eat at night because they could hear me bingeing downstairs in the kitchen because of my shame

- my mom strongly encouraging me to not wear tight clothes because ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt like how it makes me look in pictures‚Äù

- my mom checking my bank statements and asking about food purchases

- my mom trying to lightheartedly poke fun at my low tolerance for shopping. It‚Äôs a well known fact between us that I get really drained when shopping with her, and it took me a while to realize that it was because shopping and trying on clothes, especially with her there, is a huge ed trigger

- my brother‚Äôs girlfriend being extremely skinny (I suspect some restrictive ed going on) and my mom going on and on about how cute and petite she is and how fun it is to buy gifts for her because everything looks good on her

- my mom being really supportive and complimentary about my personality, intelligence, sense of humor, etc. With extremely minimal compliments about anything to do with my appearance (except my complexion and some facial features, she always compliments those)

i don't insult people for their weight or body or anything but i sure do think it, like, A Lot, even pre-ED. 90% sure that makes me fatphobic?

i just keep seeing people say that AN isn't inherently fatphobic so you're still required to be bOdY pOsiTiVe and as a stereotypical ""want to lose weight bc of beauty standards"" anorexic i legitimately just cannot understand it. if i'm understanding correctly AN is basically just ""you want to be skinni‚Ñ¢ -> you restrict"" and that's it.

so how can you be not fatphobic while trying to be thin and being horrified by the idea of being fat? how can you balance such opposing ideals? it doesn't make sense to me that one can simultaneously think, genuinely, ""this fat body is still beautiful"" and ""if i looked like that i would cry and fast for x days""? also those who are anorexic and attracted to fat people, i don't really understand.

Hi everyone, using a throw away,  I am really new to ED recovery and EDA. 

After attending a few zoom meetings passively while off sick from work (because of physical problems caused by disordered eating).  I returned to work and immediately fell back into my old patterns.

 While in crises 1 night I randomly decided to attend a meeting that I don't usually go to because I was in such a bad state.
 
 That meeting was the first time I really felt like I connect with the program and saw my self in the literature. I reached out in an EDA what's app group I was part of to see if I could talk more to someone as I was really in a bad place. 
 
I started chatting with someone and after exchanging a few messages and phone calls over about a week I decided I was finally ready to commit to the program. And this person said they would be my sponsor and we could start doing readings together. 

We continued to chat sporadically over the course of a few days while I wait for the book to arrive. Then about 3 days ago they stopped responding. Opened my messages but never answered. 

The logical side of my brain said that well people have lives it's probably a mistake etc etc. 

But the emotional side of me is really running wild. 

I have bad social anxiety and autism so find it difficult to read cues and often catastophise in my head. 

I feel like I broke some sorta rule that I wasn't aware of. That I did something bad to break the communication and relationship I had started to build. 

I struggle with new social rules and don't fully understand and am still working  out how the sponsor relationship works. 

I really really connected to the person I was talking to and even in just the few days of conversation I felt like I was really Starting to get some clarity and reframing my thoughts about my eating issues. 

I struggle alot with the reading and interpretation of the literature on my own because of my learning disability. I also find it hard because of religious trauma related to being raised Catholic and being able to talk about the process with someone who has similar experiences with religion and could approach it from an atheist/agnostic view point was the first time I felt like I was conecting. 

I had been feeling really bleak and hopeless. 

I reached out to my Dr to try get help from a dietitian or really any kinda support a  couple of weeks ago. But  according to blood tests I wasn't bad enough to ""need"" help. 

I feel like I am just barely keeping my head above water and I keep going under but no 1 will help me till I actually drown and it's too late. 

I feel like Everytime I take a step to try get help and start getting some hope I get the rug pulled out from under me. 

After experiencing some relief initially I just feel so so done with trying. 

What's even the point of trying to recover or even just fighting so hard to remain exactly where I am if any progress I make or when I try to reach I get  let down. 

I have been struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts and falling back into ED patterns has just been making them so much worse. 

Like I can't even look after my self anymore so why even bother keeping going. 

I recently started working with a new therapist and we have been going through some pretty intense stuff and I am only coming to terms with the fact that some of the experiences I had growing up and how I was treated were not ok.  so I am deep into that while struggling with my ED. 

I am just looking for an out like some sorta release. I almost self harmed today for the 1st time in a really long time and the only reason I didn't was because the shop was out of my preferred tool. 

 I've been having a really difficult couple of days. My partner and housemate kno I've been struggling as does my theaepist but I still feel like I am wading through this on my own.",1644620395.0
Chest pain but normal EKGs?,1,sqbxgl,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sqbxgl/chest_pain_but_normal_ekgs/,5,"Hello to all my ED babes, bros, and neither/both. Was wondering who has had chest pains while either actively restricting or accidentally undereating.

I was having chest pain a few months back, but due to body dysmorphia didn't even know I was losing weight, so I logged cals for a few days and found I was accidentally undereating. I went to the doctor and mentioned I had been undereating on accident. They know I have a history of ED and that I had chest pain in the past while actively restricting. They didn't seem to be concerned that my chest was hurting but did an EKG and it came back normal.

Problem is I'm half actively restricting half accidentally. Like, I undereat accidentally but when I remember how long it's been since I ate it's really hard to get myself to eat as many cals as I need. My chest is hurting way less than it did last time. I just don't know if the medical bills that I can't afford will be worth it, especially if the EKG comes back normal again.

NOT ASKING FOR MEDICAL ADVICE, just ranting a bit and wanted to know if anyone else has had consistent chest pain but normal EKGs.

Although I don't think I have ED, I am aware that I have difficulty with food.

I was overweight almost all my life, and always was on a diet, restricting myself then binge eating but never loosing any weight. It also affected my relationships with people, started to isolate myself from people. Until a few years ago, I was starting to get used to the fact, that it's gonna be for me, I'll just have to let it go when I suddenly dropped a lot of weight. It was because a very chaotic and intense workplace I had and then also taking drugs and not eating for days while doing intense physical work.

During the pandemic I couldn't move that much, not gained back all of it, but a noticeable amount. This point I started to eat as little and possible and exercise as much as I physically can and I did drop a lot of weight, I honestly was feeling very good in my body.

Then I met my boyfriend who is a very healthy, sporty person, eats intuitively and overall good. With him, I started to realize that my way of eating is not okay. It got to the point, where we were doing groceries and I would have a panic attack just thinking about the amount of food that there is, that normally I would like but I cannot have. This induced my habit of excessively scratching my skin and hitting my stomach/thighs/parts that I deem fat just to feel the pain and to stop myself thinking about food. 

With him supporting me I slowly started to eat a bit better, not thinking about it too much, trying to eat intuitively and I started to feel a bit better. But now, I started to gain back a little bit of weight and I am getting back to my old habits. I even tried self-induced vomiting many times but I am never successful but I keep trying until the throat is starting to cramp up and to the verge of passing out. 

I am freaking out because anytime I do something like I described I get really scared, but I don't know how to bring up to talk about it with anybody.

"non-disordered dieting gf admitted that she eats less than 800 cals a day, while i‚Äôve been trying to recover",53,spbxbx,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/spbxbx/nondisordered_dieting_gf_admitted_that_she_eats/,9,"so about three weeks ago, my gf and a close friend had an intervention sort of thing where they basically told me if i keep refusing recovery, they‚Äôre going to either leave or reach out for professional help. so i‚Äôve been attempting to recover since then and it‚Äôs been absolute hell for me, it‚Äôs made me morbidly depressed and even more miserable than i was before. i wasn‚Äôt ready to recover yet and i‚Äôve relapsed into a binge/fast cycle.

my gf has been dieting lately, and she also doesn‚Äôt really know much about disordered behavior and restricting. so i kind of figured she was rapidly losing weight healthily.

until yesterday, she was talking about her diet and just casually mentioned that she stays under 800 cals a day, she thought this was completely normal. this put me in shock, i had to tell her that what she‚Äôs doing is literally starving and is considered mid restricting. she was confused and told me she wasn‚Äôt losing any weight with a 1200-1650 intake, and thought that lowering it was normal. she doesn‚Äôt have an ED and isn‚Äôt obsessive about her diet or losing weight, she genuinely thought this was normal because it was working.

this of course triggered me into fucking oblivion, especially since i‚Äôm attempting recovery right now for her, and it‚Äôs been horrendously rough for me mentally. 

i feel guilty being so angry about it because i really do trust that she didn‚Äôt know what she was doing is unhealthy. but my disordered brain has made my thought process so toxic that i can‚Äôt help but get angry and frustrated that this happened while i‚Äôm recovering. idk what to do this is such a weird situation :/",1644514150.0

Heavily underweighted but atypical Anorexia,21,spi4by,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/spi4by/heavily_underweighted_but_atypical_anorexia/,4,"I'm diagnosed with atypical anorexia, even though I was obvious underweighted before my recovery and had all of the symptons of anorexia. 

I've been in a mental hospital for 6 months, mainly because of depression but also because of my eating disorder, and I got the diagnose atypical anorexia. When I asked why it is atypical, my therapist told me that my eating disorder isn't as prounounced as that of other patients. That really hurt me, essspecially because I just recently accepted the fact that I have an eating disorder, but than my therapist says I'm not ""sick enough"" to have typical anorexia. 

I know that atypical anorexia isn't less dangerous, but for my mentally ill brain it feels like my eating disorder isn't valid. I'm really desperate because I never understood what symptons has been missing. I counted my calories, lost my period, lost alot of weight in a short period of time and I also had a pericardial effusion. 

Of course I lied alot about my eating disorder and weight when I was in the clinic. I told the therapists that I hadn't the urge to move around, so I was able to leave the hospital for long walks, and I drank several liters of water before I stepped on the scale, so in conclusion I was realeased from the mental hospital when I was still underweight. 

I really don't know why my eating disorder isn't valid enough to be typical anorexia, and the fact that I wasn't considered as ""sick enough"" triggers me so hard that I kinda wanna relapse again in order to prove that I have anorexia.

i was starting to feel good about recovery and then read into MinnieMaud too much üò≠,9,spolaa,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/spolaa/i_was_starting_to_feel_good_about_recovery_and/,5,"i was initially just starting to try and have a better relationship with food, listen to my body (if i was hungry instead of snacking, have a full meal, if. i still wanted a snack i'd get that snack but ideally make it a healthier snack in the sense of like nutritious value, etc) and i was incorporating exercise and working on my trust in myself when i said i knew i was doing it for the right reasons of wanting to be stronger and build muscle and eat food in order to build that muscle.

so then once i realized i was more or less on this road to recovery, i decided to dive into internet research to validate my efforts on days it got hard (but also trying to avoid a lot of pro recovery things on IG like ""eat a fuck ton of ice cream, who cares!!"" and ""you'll actually LOVE your weight gain when you double the size you were before you even had your ED... i know i do!"" because i was like: look, I'm just gonna strive for health. that's all you can do and i was making major mental progress before

BUT then i started looking into more of a perfectionist-pleasing step by step plan because i wanted to make sure i wouldn't damage my body, wanted some clarity on symptoms, and wanted to discover a potential general timeline of when i could just be normal again and be like all these Instagram fitness girls who just live their lives while also strengthening their bodies.

(also i knew nothing about metabolic damage or weight restoration so i thought that'd be good research to do)

but long story short i discovered Minnie maud, loosely followed it for a couple of days (more so mentally than actually meeting any sort of minimum, i.e. ""its okay if i eat x bc I'm not even close to the minimum yet"" and ""wait, should i be exercising if I'm not weight restored? but i want to bc it makes me feel good... unless I'm lying to myself and this is actually quasi-recovery... what even IS quasi-recovery..."") and this mentality lead me to consume 5 bowls of Lucky Charms because i was told that its okay to eat anything and everything and to destroy the concept of bad food etc. but i didn't feel good when i knew i wasn't properly nourishing my body in any sense other than sugar shapes and red 40.

anyway, i was about to buy the book associated with it and then i saw some VERY concerning and overwhelming reviews that claimed it was actually severely dangerous, potentially harmful, and could make me gain significant amounts of weight with the unrestricted. guidelines it preached. 

this... then sent me into spiraling thinking that i have completely lost my positive, upward-looking recovery mentality because i agreed to this stupid method and now gained all this weight for nothing because it could be a harmful way to recover. this lead me to panic, binge on protein bars, sob, and end up on a call with aslana, a recovery center i can't necessarily afford right now and honestly don't entirely think i need???

AGH. i just don't know enough about my body and what it specifically needs and trying to do the research on my own is impossible because there is. so much conflicting information. i miss my initial mentality, but i fear I'll never get it back or that. it wasn't even that great to begin with.

i know i am supposed to seek a medical team and weight restoration and all these other recovery things, but i have no clue where to start, what to do, who to trust, and i feel hopeless. 

i am now in this analysis paralysis of not wanting to do ANYTHING. like i am too scared to restrict, indulge, exercise, avoid it, so right now I'm choosing to lay here and cry and post this on this group.

i know i can't seek medical advice but?? can i have like a general three step guide to choosing recovery?! I've chosen but now i don't know what to do. where to start

is spending thousands of dollars absolutely required btw?

**TLDR: i chose recovery, felt good and made some mental progress, researched Minnie maud, loosely followed, found out it's bullshit and now i know all this scary medical info that may or may not be accurate & my mentality is fucked. how does one... recovery**

* I put photos of skinny girls on my wall as inspo
* in year 12 I‚Äôd have short periods of barely eating / eating non calorie jelly and carrots with mustard to lose weight. It never stuck though and I‚Äôd cave

* I have a terrible relationship with food and overeat insanely now. Have gained 45 kilos + in about 6 years
* would go through short periods of way over exercising or under eating but it never stuck

* tried to eat under 500 calories for a while but again it didn‚Äôt stick
* tried to purge but couldn‚Äôt
* I still struggle with the thoughts that I should starve myself

My dad is really overbearing about weight and constantly talks about calories and what I eat in a negative way. He‚Äôs also very restrictive on himself. His sister had an ED growing up. My mum also has a bad relationship with food, crash diets, trying smoking to lose weight, and had me on diets when I was like 11 which involves taking protein shakes to school for lunch.

The reason I‚Äôm wondering is because I know these things are ED tendencies but it never ‚Äòstuck‚Äô if that makes sense. Like I‚Äôd go back to eating, back to not exercising, etc after a few days or weeks.

i think im going to try it. it will depend on how i feel tomorrow i guess, but ideally i would still let myself eat breakfast or snacks before any deserts in the evening. something proper during the evening would help too, but that might be a bit much for my brain right now.

i still struggle a lot with this but you would be surprised to know how many times i actually ate although i was determined to not do it, i got the will power to eat, just because they said something like that

both my partner and i use they them pronouns

ive had an ed since before i met my current partner (2 years in may). they have been supporting me endlessly through my ups and downs, and i mean that literally, bmi 18-23 and everything in between. they try their best to understand and never ever encourage my behaviors. 

when i gain weight, any amount of weight, i become isolated, i feel disgusting. this is how i feel now but to an extent i haven‚Äôt felt when i gained 2-4 lbs and freaked out about it, because im at one of my highest weights right now.

last july i hit 107 at 5‚Äô4 after a month of abusing my body. since then i have gained up to 135-140 and i hate myself. i don‚Äôt feel like myself honestly, and i cant hide it from my partner. i told them i may or may not visit this weekend, but in reality im waiting until i get back into the 120s to see them and their roommates again. 

truth is i have only been able to restrict for 4-5 days before a 2-3 day period of binge eating. i was on track to 130 a couple of days back but who knows where i am now. this makes me feel horrible and i don‚Äôt want anything but to isolate during these cycles. 

my partner says i choose my behaviors over them. but as a bulimic who has gained weight i feel like i have no choice but to. i feel like losing again would make me confident, will save our relationship. they would see something to be proud of in me. 

i feel like the only solution to this is to lose to a weight i feel comfortable in and show my partner i can manage both myself and the relationship. they tell me they love me at any weight, that their roommates won‚Äôt gaf about my weight gain, but deep within me i know i will never feel like myself above 120lbs.

I‚Äôve been to three therapists in my life. The first one, after two sessions, told me she thinks I have an eating disorder and wanted to talk to me about it. I immediately stopped seeing her because I thought to myself, ‚Äúthis lady doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about..I eat and I‚Äôm not skinny enough to be labeled as having an eating disorder.‚Äù

Years later, a second therapist clocked it in the first session and said she wasn‚Äôt the best fit for me because most of my issues are rooted in body image and she referred me to a therapist that specialized in eating disorders, who I never went to see because, again, I do eat and I‚Äôm not skinny enough for an ED.

A year after that, I saw a third therapist who was patient and gentle in bringing it up to me. She explained an eating disorder is about your relationship with food and how it affects your psyche, regardless of what you weigh.

I still didn‚Äôt accept it after that, but I was more open-minded. I did a lot of reading into EDs and finally, after a longgg time - after a literal lifetime of having an ED (because my mom has one) - I finally only in the last year or so accepted that I have one.

Six months ago I told my mom. She immediately said I don‚Äôt have one. Obviously because in her mind I‚Äôm not skinny enough and I still eat. My mom overtly and explicitly hates her own body with a passion and will also go on to tell me how we have the same body type. She‚Äôs been doing that since I was a kid. She put me on the Atkins diet when I was 12 years old. She‚Äôs not malicious - she just has her own issues. She also currently weighs less than me and oh man is it triggering.

Today I told the second person I‚Äôve ever told - I told my best friend. And she too INSTANTLY said I don‚Äôt have one.

I haven‚Äôt eaten over >!1000!< calories for the majority of days. However, yesterday I ate around >!600!< calories before having a bag of chips from the chippy which I can‚Äôt really estimate but know is a lot. 

I ended up gaining around 1 pound and 1/4 of a pound from that.

I don‚Äôt know. I want to recover or atleast start eating more but I have a terrifying fear of the inevitable weight gain.

I once started bingeing so badly I gained over 10 pounds within 5 days. However, I then plateaud and seemed to stay around the same weight when bingeing for the next two? Is something similar likely to happen in recovery.

I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to even gain 10 pounds if that was the case. However, I want to have the reassurance for if I do start taking this step, you know?

I now have to get injections in my eyes from restricting insulin,67,sog4hc,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/sog4hc/i_now_have_to_get_injections_in_my_eyes_from/,11,"So I just need to rant for a sec. I‚Äôm sorry if this post is a mess to read. 

I have to now get injections in my eyes every 4 weeks right now. I had my first set of injections about 3 months ago. All because I restricted my insulin. For a whole year I had diabetes burnout and I was just so sick of taking shots or using my insulin pump. I then noticed how much weight I lost from restricting, so  after I got out of the funk I was in, I was still restricting in fear of gaining my weight back. I knew the bad outcomes from having high sugars all the time, I knew about nerve pain, eye damage. I heard all the stories but I didn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôd deal with it later. 


Everyone was telling me how good I looked with my weight loss thinking I was just on a diet.  I was so scared that everyone would notice if I gained even 5 pounds. I‚Äôd feel like crap 24/7, I was basically a walking zombie during the time I was restricting. Constantly feeing on the verge of throwing up, my body would ache all over, I was sleeping all day long, I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on my school work, walking to my car right outside would have my heart pounding. Back in July I got tired of this and decided to put my insulin pump back on and count my carbs like I was supposed to before and I started seeing my diabetic dr. I ended up gaining all of my weight back, the old habits was constantly in the back of my head. I was okay though, I was proud of myself. i managed the bad thoughts and started trying to loose weight in a healthier way. I felt amazing, I didn‚Äôt feel out of breath anymore, I wasn‚Äôt sleeping all day long, I was doing so good. Then about 3 months ago  I started having blurry vision, which was weird because I just had my eye exam 3 months before then and everything looked good.

.I went in and was told that I have diabetic retinopathy in both eyes and need injections. I‚Äôm so frustrated, I‚Äôve been doing good since July and now that My sugars are under control my body is catching up to me. I would‚Äôve understood last year if I needed injections because my sugars were running in the 400s all day long (they now rarely get over 120) On top of that my 21st bday is coming up the first of April and to celebrate im going to the beach and in the back of my head I keep thinking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs one month of restricting‚Äù. I just think about how easy it is to loose weight when I‚Äôm restricting and I don‚Äôt want to look big in my 21st pics and cry about it. 

Who the hell goes through the trauma experience of getting told you need injections in your eyes for probably a good while and you‚Äôre seriously thinking about how it might be worth it in order to be somewhat skinnier. I literally cried the first time I started getting injections in my eyes and every time I go after that I get super anxious but here I am thinking that I don‚Äôt want to celebrate my 21st bday with my weight gain. Sorry again of this was a mess I just had to rant",1644420199.0
