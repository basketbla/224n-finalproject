What can you do about BDD?,184,iwwqte,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/iwwqte/what_can_you_do_about_bdd/,15,"There are many ways one can combat body dysmorphia. Some people are able to manage symptoms on their own, some need medical intervention or more intense periods of treatment. What ever your situation, there are ways to combat BDD. 

Here are some way to combat your BDD listed in ascending order from self help to medical treatments. 

- **Self-help:**    
This can include many things. Anything from taking physical care of yourself, to reading about BDD and how it’s treated to making changes in your life that help support a stable mental health. Self help in a great tool and at the bottom of every recovery is the personal desire to better ones situation. 

   
- **[BDD workbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/it3uwg/selfhelp_body_dysmorphia_workbook/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf):**     
Compiled by medial professionals, the workbook gives important insight to how BDD works, what triggers it and what methods you can learn to help yourself in a proven way. You’ll learn to limit your obsessive behaviour and recognise disordered thinking. This is one of the best self help tools there is. 

   
- **Online therapy and support groups:**    
[The BDD Foundation](https://bddfoundation.org/support-groups/) for example offers online therapy groups that come together weekly. A free and easy to access form of therapy can be a good support in addressing BDD symptoms if there are no possibilities or need for more personal or intense forms of therapy. 

   
- **Therapy:**    
Cognitive-behavioural therapy, or CBT, is the recommend form of treatment for people with BDD. It can focus on what are the specific issues and triggers in you and how they can be helped. This is a form of treatment that can give great, individual help and offer support in every area of life on top of BDD. 

- **BDD specialists:**    
Though sadly quite rare, there are places and therapists and doctors who focus on BDD and other related disorders. They can give more focused advice and treatment and are often informed with the latest developments. This is a good choice when available. 

- **Psyciatric professionals:**    
This form involves doctors like psychiatrists, who can give formal diagnosis as well as offer medical level advice and give prescriptions. If you feel like your BDD is so intense that functioning in daily life is hard or you feel like you could benefit from medication, it’s a good idea to talk to also a psyciatrist as well as a therapist. 

- **Medication:**    
Because BDD is a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder, it’s symptoms can often be alleviated the same as many OCDs. Sometimes medication can be a great tool in reducing the symptoms, and combined with therapy, the likelihood of better quality of life is high.   


- **Out patient care:**    
If more intense forms of care seems to be needed, one option is out patient care where the patient is in a close contact with, usually a psychiatric hospital or a doctor, and usually has for example therapy sessions several times a week. This can be a good options for those who have a very hard time with daily functioning or are suicidal.    


- **In patient care:**    
The rarest form of treatment is in patient care where the patient stays in the hospital and can be given support and help daily. This often requires for the patient to be in acute risk of suicide or is unable to function in their daily life. Though this is often the last option, it’s good to know that help is available even when things are very serious. 

The forms of treatment and the health care systems work differently in every country and it’s always a good idea to talk to your local doctors and professionals on what options are available to you. But know that there are many ways that BDD can be treated and alleviated. The most important thing is remembering you’re worth help and there are several ways to get it.",1600678389.0
You can always look worse - a warning about plastic surgery,417,r86rrh,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/r86rrh/you_can_always_look_worse_a_warning_about_plastic/,104,"Hello. I'm new to this sub, but not to BDD. I notice a lot of users on here think they're so ugly that nothing could make them look worse--so they pursue plastic surgery in hopes of getting an improvement that will magically release them from their mental illness.

Well, I'm here to tell you that yes, **you can look worse** than you do now after plastic surgery. In fact, you're more at risk of getting botched if you go into surgery with untreated BDD.

I'll share my story as a warning. I want to help people on here avoid what I went through.

This is a long post, but I assure you it's worth reading if you are planning to have cosmetic work done and live with untreated BDD.

**First, a short background:** Prior to getting cosmetic surgery, I was objectively a moderately attractive person. I had early symptoms of BDD, but it wasn't until age 11 that my BDD actually became destructive. I focused almost exclusively on my skin, and my BDD was a constant source of anxiety and despair. I lived with severe BDD until age 18, when enough changes were happening in my life that my mental illness entered a more benign state. Between 18-26 my symptoms were mild and I could focus on other things. Around 27 my BDD ramped up again and I became fixated on changing everything about my face--but my nose was my greatest obsession.

**I pursued a lot of unnecessary plastic surgery in a short period of time and wound up getting botched.** I was irrational at the time I booked the surgeries and chose to ignore obvious red flags. Let me repeat: *Because I felt so impossibly ugly, and was thinking so irrationally, I disregarded red flags.* I also disregarded the advice of good surgeons who told me I looked fine and did not need surgery.

**When you pursue cosmetic surgery with untreated BDD, you are more at risk of:**

* Not asking enough questions or the right questions during consults
* Proceeding with a surgeon who offers you the moon/unrealistic outcomes
* Ignoring surgeons who advise you to avoid surgery
* Ignoring the concerns of friends and family
* Choosing a surgeon in another country without considering how this impacts aftercare
* Spending impulsively on treatments and consultations
* Disregarding negative reviews because you think a bad result won't happen to you
* Choosing a surgeon based on bedside manner rather than reviews and results
* Rationalizing that even if you don't get a great result, any improvement is better than what you're currently living with
* Overvaluing positive reviews, especially reviews that don't include photos
* Ignoring your gut when something feels off

Everyone who pursues cosmetic surgery faces these risks, but for people with BDD these risks are amplified because you are delusional, desperate, and often times in a state of high-functioning psychosis.

**Surgery will not fix your disorder.** *No matter the outcome*, you will keep getting more and more surgeries because you will never be satisfied, not even by a good result. And the more surgeries you have, the more you risk emerging from surgery unnatural, unrecognizable, and botched.

**This is what happened to me.** I had a good primary rhinoplasty result but still wasn't satisfied, so I pursed a revision with a different surgeon who removed all the cartilage from my tip and left me scarred and blobby. The revision surgery of *that* revision left me without an infratip and a recessed, retracted columella. I look operated on, and now I have a shapeless triangle in the middle of my face. Worse, this third surgery has changed my favorite feature--my smile.

It took botching my nose, losing my identity, and spending a bucketload of money to do it for me to finally face my BDD and pursue treatment for my mental illness.

**Let my story be a warning and a call to action.** Do *not* pursue plastic surgery before you pursue therapy and/or self-help for your BDD. Get help *first.* BDD causes **delusional thinking** and it is likely you are operating in an irrational, delusional state when you pursue surgery. You may think your thoughts are rational because in your head your ugliness is plain as day. But **BDD is a mental illness that can alter the way your brain sees itself in reflections.** The way I perceived myself before getting surgery changed hour to hour, day to day.

You are not objective, you are not rational. You have a mental illness and that part of you needs treatment, not your body.

And remember, you can always look worse than you do now. I wouldn't say I look like a monster after my surgeries (that would be my BDD talking), but I don't look quite right anymore, and I am certainly less attractive.

I am now searching for worth and meaning in areas outside of my appearance. I hope to share a positive update here soon. For now, please consider my warning and take care.",1638559004.0
Just read a whole thread from men trashing on small boobs,51,sx90i4,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sx90i4/just_read_a_whole_thread_from_men_trashing_on/,20,"Saying things like ‘push up bras are lying’, ‘it’s so disappointing when her boobs are smaller than they looked’. Really made me and my A cups feel great! I just wish men would stop criticising women’s appearances at every turn like it’s our sole purpose to appeal to them. They would cry body shaming if women talked about how disappointed they were that their tinder date was shorter than his pictures. But they can openly talk all over Reddit about how disappointing small boobs or butts are and get thousands of upvotes from their bro’s, and literally no one calls them out! This disorder is bad enough without the constant reminder that everyone thinks you look unattractive too and it’s not just your own warped perception.",1645384937.0
I severely ugly and unlovable I finally looked in the mirror,5,sxep3b,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sxep3b/i_severely_ugly_and_unlovable_i_finally_looked_in/,1,"I just want to die I have nothing nobody nada nothing no personality no friends no relationships no social skills empty fking empty I’m done If you saw me you honestly would be grossed out. if everyone comments on how ugly I am how am I supposed to accept it? How am I supposed to accept that I’ll never be able to be in a relationship. There’s nothing about myself to love, nothing. I’m mentally ill My parents feel bad for me but my mom laughs at my face. Ive only been laughed at. My therapist couldn’t even help me. Ive been abandoned my whole life. My parents are attractive I’m hideous I don’t look good in nice clothes, I look like I’m wearing a Halloween costume dressed as a well dressed thumb. I don’t need you to say anything I don’t need to know it gets better. It doesn’t and it gets worse, atleast for me my situation can’t be changed the only change I can make is destroying the game and unplugging the cords forever. But I don’t feel like dieing I feel like staying just because It would be sad for my parents to find my lifeless body. 

I have a good heart but it’s masked. Masked by what I look like, I know how ridiculous does that seem? I gave up because I was rejected by the world, by our society saying “looks don’t matter” when they just do so stop giving people that bs. “Personality matters” what they mean is you need to entertain me and check off all my personality boxes, or your going to be seen as the ugly person you always were. If you make a mistake and have a bad day I Actually never cared about you, your ugly like I’d rather look at a wall. I don’t want to be seen as attractive I wanna be seen as the neighbor down the street. Not the fugly thumb looking dude. 

 I’m honestly getting used to being disgusting and sad. Feeling happy makes me uncomfortable. I was a cute kid until puberty hit and it was the worst years of my life. My moms friend couldn’t recognize me and had a disgusting look on her face. My mom commented on how big my nose is. I wouldn’t want anyone to live like this, It just hurts so bad. I feel pain 24/7 I tear up whenever I’m not busy on video games or other things I hate. I’m so bored. I can’t comprehend how this is possible imagine looking decent until 14 boom just severally disgusting like wtf how. UGHHHHHHHHHHH. I feel like this has got to be a joke. I’m such a joke compared to my family I’m a sad shrek that needs to grow up. I keep trying and trying trying I’ve learned that some people are just cursed. Just a boomerang you can’t go farther. My life feels free sims game where the game has a bug, so I’m stuck in my room 24/7, and all I can do is watch others live there lives while I wait, except there’s no more waiting, the bug is infinite, the bug is distorted, uncomfortable. I’ll try to leave my room but It just another portal that leads right back to it. I try to fix my life but the bug is always ruining it. it never lets me leave my room longer than a week. A relationship isn’t even an idea anymore it just won’t happen. I couldn’t allow myself to put someone else through pretending to like me.",1645400098.0
I feel like my body doesn't represent me at all,10,sx8o5s,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sx8o5s/i_feel_like_my_body_doesnt_represent_me_at_all/,2,"I think it's why I'm depressed. And it's not in the ""if I were skinnier, if I were prettier"" way. The best way I can describe it is in the transgender way. I always thought body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria were very similar and I can relate to transgender people a lot.


Except changing my sex still won't make me feel okay.


For me, I feel like I have to completely change myself because NOTHING represents me. The me in the inside and the body I could not choose are so different it makes me feel sick this is how I will be for as long as I'm in this body. Hate my voice. Hate my height. Hate my personality. Hate the way my brain naturally expresses me. Meaning I hate the way I speak, express my thoughts, body language, etc. 


And obviously hate my appearance. Things I can't change like bone structure and some other ugly things about me.


This easily explains why I wanna kms. The only way I leave this body is through death. 



I can't even talk about this irl without people thinking I'm crazy or dramatic ""oh u want to kms over this lame thing just get over yourself there are people starving"" 🤷🏻‍♀️",1645384028.0

Can we please stop commenting about our issues on someone's post about the opposite problem?,5,sxdzlz,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sxdzlz/can_we_please_stop_commenting_about_our_issues_on/,1,"Someone just poured their heart out about how upset, broken and how badly they're hurting over a certain flaw they have/perceive themselves to be lacking, and the first thing some people think to comment is ""I have it"". Its usually on posts about small breasts. There will *always* be one person to go ""I have big breasts"" or ""I have medium sized breasts I wish I had A cups"". Without fail. And I just want to point out how painful that can be for the OP.

To comment that you have something the OP is lacking, or broken over, makes them feel more alone. It makes them feel like they're the only one with small breasts for example, and that they're a freak of nature, or proof that they're not a real girl because it's so uncommon to have small breasts like they do. It's incredibly frustrating to read ""I have big breasts"" type comments over and over. I understand some of those comments come from a place of care, and are trying to offer another perspective. And I do appreciate it. But this is BDD. It's not rational. It's like a parasite stuck to your brain. If 100 people can tell someone they're beautiful and they still don't believe it, how could telling a small breasted woman about your big breasts be helpful in any way?

While women with big breasts absolutely struggle in many ways, so do women with small breasts. Commenting ""I have D cups and they're awful! I'll donate mine lol!"" feels incredibly belittling to the other person's pain, making light of someone's hurt after they've just poured their heart out in a post about how upset they are. There's no need for OP to read random strangers' cup sizes just for them to feel more alone, freakish and abnormal. I know these comments come from a place of care, to list all the disadvantages of having bigger breasts so OP feels better/more grateful for what they have, but the thing is most smaller breasted women don't want to suddenly go from A cup to D cup, they just want to be a little bit bigger, so these issues from the other end of the spectrum aren't any of their concern. Also, being a small breasted woman comes with a set of issues that are completely unique to those of bigger breasted women. I feel like some bigger breasted women think that just because we dont have ""real breasts"" that we can't possibly know what it's like to struggle. Showing us a list of your problems is not going to cure ours. They're completely different struggles, both unique, but both valid.

Imagine writing out 3 paragraphs about how your bigger breasts make you so insecure, you hate them so much, they make you cry every night, just for someone to comment ""I'm an A cup I wish I was as big as you"". I'm sure it's happened, I'm just yet to see it. Its very inconsiderate, it just disregards all the struggles that person opened up about, and is kind of saying ""you don't have issues"" if you're wishing to be like them and not consider how awful it appears to be for that person? If your friend was upset and crying about their big nose you wouldnt say ""I have a small nose"", no, you would comfort them. If someone was complaining about being obese, you wouldnt say ""well....I'm skinny"". Its not helpful at all, and it's not about you being skinny right now. It's about how they feel upset over being obese. I haven't really noticed any of these types of comments besides small chested girls' posts which is heartbreaking, but unfortunately it does feel like there's this strange power thing secretly going on and it's just something flat chested women have come to expect when posting here, which is wrong, they should feel as valid and comfortable as everyone else. My point is, nobody's first response to someone's pain should be to point the attention to themselves, *especially* if they're unable to relate at all. Just because having big breasts can suck, doesn't mean having small breasts can't suck either. BDD can be about anything, unfortunately, and none of you are less valid for your feelings.

The appropriate response to these posts should be to support the OP, lift them up, share your experiences on how you can relate so they feel understood and not alone, and if you can't relate, just be supportive or scroll past. Try to be more thoughtful and think how you would like to be comforted. We are all struggling here. Let's try to understand and support one another.",1645398123.0

Since I knew nobody else was there, I went into the women’s bathroom and took my clothes off in front of the big wall-mirror to look at my body. I felt gross and embarrassed for doing it but that’s how obsessed I’ve become with constantly body checking.

This disorder has so many severe symptoms and it makes you feel so damn depressed & the delusional thought patterns + thinking about your appearance EVERY SECOND of the day is EXHAUSTING.  Not even knowing what you look like, having multiple images in your head of what your face can look like & not knowing which image is the most accurate. Not being able to trust your own reflection.  Feeling ashamed of your body.  Almost havin no interrests in anything except things that have something to do with appearance/image. Feeling depressed and low on levels that are intense, isolated in your room all day.  Feeling like a deformed monster, which makes you not being able to look people in the eyes when talking of course. Being addicted to the mirror you can't stop lookin at it because you can't believe what you're seeing is real. Or on just completely not looking in the mirror. Being scared of mirrors & camera's.

The second a bad thought comes to my head or something bad happens to me, I think to myself that I only have one life. It motivates me to not only climb higher but to also not stress about it and find better coping mechanisms rather than crying on my bed all day. Use your ONE life to hype yourself the f#ck up. If you need to tell yourself that you’re hot every single day (even though you are), but you need to tell yourself that because you don’t believe it yourself, DO IT. Do it until you believe that you’re the most beautiful girl in the world. I know it’s hard to be confident sometimes when the beauty standard is changing constantly. Literally one day hip dips could be in, and the next they're not. You have no f#cking clue when the standard will change. 

If you don’t like something about yourself, THEN CHANGE IT. There are things we can and can’t change about ourselves. Exa: I **can** change my hair color and lose/gain weight, but I **can't** change my skin color. Why point out your skin color then? It is a pure waste of energy to hate it. If you have to change something to make you feel better (exa: nose job, fashion sense, hair color, boob job, labiaplasty, tummy tuck, etc), make sure you are doing it FOR YOU mama. When you change these things about yourself, make sure you do it so that it boosts your confidence in the right way. Make sure it doesn't eat away at your confidence. For example, let's say you dye your hair red. Just make sure that when your roots grow out, it doesn't kill you inside. Do it for YOUR validation and attention. When you do stuff for other people, that’s not confidence. That’s just being a people pleaser. One day you’re gonna grow old and realize that you wasted so much time crying and being depressed over how your body looks when you could have been out making happy memories with your loved ones and loving yourself.

One thing I always tell my friends and other people is **DO NOT TAKE CRITICISM FROM SOMEONE YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ADVICE FROM!!** It is okay to have a small group of people who you take criticism from. For example, the other day I facetimed my friend and she told me my outfit looked way too off to wear in public. Did it hurt to hear? Yes. When I looked in the mirror and realized that the colors were clashing and indeed looked weird, I appreciated her genuine advice. People that make you feel insecure do not want the best for you. Exa: cyber bullies and school bullies. So DO NOT listen to them nor take advice from them. Half the time they have no profile picture. They do not know you, so do not gaf about what they have to say. We have to care about someone's opinion. Someone has to look out for us. Make sure you choose those people wisely and know they want the best for you. 

Another point I wanted to make is know the difference between cocky/conceited and CONFIDENT. Every single day when I wake up, I tell myself that I am hot, smart, and successful, and that I am going to eat because I deserve it. Whenever I FaceTime my best friends, I frequently tell them ""you are hot, smart, and beautiful, and I am so grateful to have you as a friend. I am so happy that you are THAT B\*TCH"". Giving words of affirmation shows that you are confident and not cocky. 

**Here is the blunt part** \- but meant with all the love in the world: People don't like to be around insecure people. Because while you are making yourself suffer in literal silence, you're simultaneously so loud. Let me explain what I mean by this. I am just using a heterosexual dynamic for this example, because this is my personal experience. Men do not like insecure women and vice versa. Notice how there's a stereotype that women love a ""strong and confident man"". It's a stereotype for a reason, and men like the same thing in a woman. The moment I loved myself and become genuinely confident, I had a list of men hitting me up, and now I have a very loving boyfriend. I used to think the whole ""you have to love yourself before a man can love you"" was bullsh\*\*, but it is seriously so true you guys. People can tell when you're insecure, and this is what I mean when I say the word ""loud"". Insecurity screams a lot louder than anything, and while you do not mean any harm on others, it can come across that way. When you are self loathing and can't get yourself together, you tend to be negative, judgmental of others, scared of love, etc. **I used to be there**. I was that girl. I know what it's like. I  would go out for photoshoots with my friends and after an hour of taking pics, I would say ""I hate all of these. Don't post any with me in it"", and one day my friend straight up said to me ""gain some f\*cking confidence because you are way too hot to be doing this to yourself and to us"". My friend genuinely wanted to share me on her social media because she loves me and likes to share snippets of her memories with her followers (as do most of us), but I was too insecure and hated the way I looked. It got to the point it ruined friendships and made me a bitter person. This was years ago, so this process took a hot minute, as you can see. Now I am confident, gained my friends back, and love sharing myself with the world. We all deserve to contribute something to the world and to be loved. 

Nevertheless, change what you want about yourself if it boosts you in the right way and find confidence WITHIN. After this, you will attract whatever you want mamas. Feel free to direct message me if u wanna chat as well <3 much love and I hope you all take this message with lots of consideration.",1645398712.0

I feel like the terrible way I have felt about my looks for so long has seeped into my soul over the years and ironically, makes me ugly on the inside. That ugliness on the inside is probably shining outwardly and if I thought I was ugly before, it makes me actually ugly, it makes me even uglier. If I wasn’t actually ugly before and I was just imagining it, now I am.

I’m crying a lot. I want to cry all day. There’s not enough time in the week to really retreat into myself and fully feel how much pain I experience. When I do feel it, it’s overwhelming and I have no idea how its ever going to go away. It’s not just the body dysmorphia but the hurt I’ve experienced. The images in my head. The swelling in my eyes. The black stain on my spirit, making it look tarnished. 

I wish I could rid myself of the bitterness and evilness and wickedness and patheticness within that this disease has caused. I feel evil. The things I have wished on others deep down are so evil. I don’t really want anything bad to happen to anyone else but jealousy takes over me and makes me evil and ugly. It’s so hard to help feeling it when you see the face of ugly evil in the mirror. I’ve had this disease since I was very young. Now I’m 31 and aging is now a factor I have to consider. I wasted all my best years so sad about myself and now it continues. At least before, I had youth on my side. 

I want to be beautiful on the inside in a way that shines on my face and body and skin but there’s a gnarled pain inside me that is always there. It looks like an ugly demon clinging to the trees. The pain makes me not want to do anything but stew and writhe and hate but I wish others understood. I’m not really evil. I wouldn’t be hateful and jealous if I wasn’t in so much pain and felt so deeply ugly in my soul. 

If people understood this, they would simply have more compassion for jealous people. Jealous people are in so much pain we can’t even understand.",1645299047.0

I have this fantasy of being a deadly femme fatale but in a way where it's like I'm tricking other men because I'm actually a guy on the inside. 

Anyway someone sent me a mean tellonym asking me why I'm fat if I had lipo...it's mainly my boobs that are fat on me! But t shirts, anything I wear....I can't be stealthy. If I wear a binder with these I won't be able to breathe. The only articles of clothing that look good on me are the ones people pay to see me in.

I found out that girls stop growing around this age and I’m only 5’3 (my asian family genetics have cursed me to be on the shorter end). Most of my friends, some even also asian are already 5’5-5’7. My mom keeps constantly comparing me, getting mad that I’m not taller than her yet (she’s 5’5). I get horrible sleep due to studying a lot at a rigorous school, and I’m a picky eater (I love veggies, but I hate meat). 

&#x200B;

Also, whilst all the other girls in my class are sporty and slim, I’m a little round and nerdy. It sucks. I’m 5’3 120 LBS and I feel like a pig around my 5’7 100 LBS friend with non-greasy long blonde hair and skinny legs.

&#x200B;

Oh yeah, another thing. My LEGS. They’re not fat, but I HATE having thicker legs, and my parents say it’s such a blessing because boys would love it. It’s always about being pretty for the boys! I WISH I was a guy, day and night I feel so out of place in myself. My face is dry and somehow also has never ending forehead acne and dark marks. My nose is ugly and wide, and even my mom says I should get surgery to make it look more European/white. I hate my skin, tan and riddled with eczema. All the white girls in my class are so pretty, like dolls. 

&#x200B;

I hate how I fit into pants. I’m an avid enjoyer of the Dark Academia subculture, but unfortunately I don’t fit well into many of the clothing. I wish I could fit into pants and not look dumpy or so curvy. Every shirt makes me look chubbier too. 

&#x200B;

As a pianist and artist, having small hands is embarrassing and inconvenient. My fingers are so chubby and stubby, and look like small sausages. My friends have really nice, long fingers and elegant hands. I have scars on my right hand from eczema and my left hand is always stained from pen ink or paint because I’m left handed.

&#x200B;

The only good thing about me is my hair, which then again I hate having long hair but I was told I’d look fat if I cut it. And it’s greasy no matter what.

&#x200B;

My brown eyes are really bad too. It’s so common, and nobody compliments me like they do with my green eyed friend. I have eyebags from lack of sleep and chronic internet usage. I wear small round sunglasses because my vision sucks and I’m really sensitive to light. Do you know how many times I got compared at school to Doc Ock from the Spiderman franchise (in a negative way)? Love the character tho!! HATE myself. Ack. I feel so gross. 

&#x200B;

I hate seeing the boys in my class too. They’re all really charming, and people only see me as mid or “cute”. It feels degrading. I don’t want to be the “short smol bean” irl. I wish I was a 5’10, brown haired, green eyes, pale and slim boy with a charming sense of humor.

A little win: I stopped compulsively cutting my hair (it ended up shaved in places and shorter than I have ever seen it),2,swdhar,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/swdhar/a_little_win_i_stopped_compulsively_cutting_my/,0,"I’ve (33f) been cutting my own hair since junior year of hs when the small town bish gave me a mullet. I straight up looked like Janet from 3’s Company.

I cried So. Hard.

I also have 2b/3a curly hair which she did not know how to work with so out of fear, I cut my own hair now.

It’s worked out until 2 years ago when I just kept cutting hoping to change how I see myself after my depression meds ‘allowed’ me to gain 60lbs and lose feeling in my toes.

My bff moved me in with her and she’s been a real inspiration. She was growing her hair out before I finally was able to and it looks fantastic.

I feel a lot better about myself now that it has reached just above shoulder level and if I’m able to not cut it for this long (besides bangs), then I can get it longer. I can.

My hair length is directly related to how big/bad I see myself. And I’m so thankful I’ve gotten this far <3",1645287146.0

Anyone Else Overestimated Their Attractiveness?,8,sw3jqg,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sw3jqg/anyone_else_overestimated_their_attractiveness/,1,"Up until the age of 12 I was considered fairly unattractive but as I grew up I became average looking. I started wearing makeup and thought I was pretty because I had some positive reception from strangers. A group of teenagers hollered at me from their car but honestly they probably would've done that even if I looked like roadkill because they were probably just trying to provoke me. I've never had a boyfriend or been on a date before but I assumed it was just because I was too quiet and guys were intimidated by my ""beauty."" My friend told me I'm average, even with makeup, but I thought she just had too high of a standard. In public, most people are courteous with me but I'm pretty much invisible to the opposite sex. I don't get the treatment that the typical pretty girl gets such as stares or smiles but guys aren't mean to me either. For the past week I've done some intense ""inspection"" of myself in mirrors and have realized that I did overestimate my attractiveness. I'm probably a 6/10 but thought I was at least a 7/10. I've actually developed an internalized ego because of my perceived sense of attractiveness and I've realized that I've wasted a lot of time trying to convince myself that I'm pretty when I'm kind of plain.

I can't even stand just being average, I have to be at least pretty or gorgeous.

Now that I’m in the process of addressing those insecurities, I’ve started to hate my nose. I’ve NEVER minded my nose. But it always seems like once I address one insecurity another will always arise. I look really good in photos because I always edit my flaws/never smile, however that makes me feel like an absolute catfish.

I’ve had the (pleasure??) of experiencing pretty privledge for the past 2 years, with masks covering every single one of my insecurities (besides my paleness) I received so many compliments and felt so pretty.

but i’m not ok. i want to get my teeth fix this yr even tho it’s a 5k expense my dentist doesn’t recommend. i want to get my nose done even tho i’m terrified of the pain and possibility of getting botched. i want to get buccal fat removal and kybella so my profile isn’t so hideous. and i want a lipo so i can finally look thin and not as huge and fat as i look now.

sometimes certain clothing rly helps hide my fat and i look thin. but then i feel like a catfish or i catch myself off guard and i can see all my fat spilling out and feel like crap. sometimes my side profile doesn’t look too bad and i’m ok until i see what others see and feel ashamed of my weak profile and ugly teeth.

The amount of gaslighting I do to myself is insane. I try to tell myself maybe my parents are right maybe I'm actually pretty. Maybe I am being too nitpicky with my appearance. So I'll try to see myself as if I were them. Try not to look at my appearance to vividly. Try not to analyze my face. Try to wake up with a positive attitude. Try to tel myself I'm lovable and can be desired from a man. Take breaks from Instagram. Block or unfollow girls I compare myself too. All of it. But guess what. None of it really works. Even when I take a break from looking at my phone entirely, thinking maybe if I come back my brain will reset and see my pictures as pretty. Nope nope nope. It never works. My only explanation is I'm actually unnatractive. My parents overhyped me way too much with making it seem I was gorgeous. I'm not. Not at all. I've been told I'm average on the internet and that was posting my better photos. God knows if these people saw how I actually looked everyday. I'm so done with seeing this body. My face. I'm so done crying over the fact most men will not find me very attractive. And the ones that do I'll never believe it. So I'm screwed either way. I'm at my limit I thought I'd be able to possibly get on with life but I'm tired of thinking about how my life is only gonna consist of hobbies and always keeping busy instead of what most people get to do like being excited for dating and sharing that with someone.

I'm not here for advice, I've thought of it all. I've gotten comments from neighbors, friends, family, and kids. I don't go see my friends anymore. I don't go anywhere without a hat. I have to look at only the bottom half of my face in mirrors or my day gets ruined. I hate seeing myself in pictures or having to take pictures at all. I'm probably going to skip family vacations because of it. I actively avoid romantic relationships, even though I want one. Every time I go on Reddit and see someone that's bald(ing) and look at the comments there's always insults. Other internet culture that I am around does the exact same.


It's so easy for people to tell me what they think and I just want to curl up and not exist. It's so unbelievably clear that no one likes the way I look, including myself. I hate it all.",1645174957.0

I got chubby after the agen of 7 after I went through sexual abuse. (I also have hypothyrodism) I did sports, but my weight always fluctuated and adults use to say ""you would look prettier if you lost weight"". I heard this most of my life and I grew up considering myself to be unattractive because of my body, thinking no guy would ever want to be with me. 
That's why I lost my virginity in my early 20's. And even then, guys would only show interest on dating apps and they would ghost me and find a gf after me who had all the things I didn't. 

I compare myself to every pretty, slim girl and get triggered for not looking like that. I even watch their pictures and start naming all the things they have and I don't. Even in movies or series. 
I'm 25 and I've never had a boyfriend and I see teens looking amazing so young and thinking at that age I was disgusting. 
I've gotten better because I have more confidence but still hate myself most days. Like i'm ruined for not being that attractive. And funny thing, everybody tells me i'm pretty and that I've always been, but I can't take compliments that much because in my mind their not accurate.

And don't get me started on having a great day and liking yourself and then seeing someone prettier than you and just feeling like everything is ruined. Why do I always compite with these women in my mind?

I feel like I'm literally the only unattractive woman in the gym. I have an oompa loompa body and my glasses make me look dumb.

Well, it's been about 12 days since then and here are some of my achievements:

* Completed each day
* Filmed myself in my car
* Filmed myself after going to the gym
* Havent deleted a single video
* I found that some of the videos I wholeheartedly hated were not that bad after 10 days
* Filmed myself smiling and not looking at the camera

Here are some things I could work on:

* When I filmed my body I kept repeating the video and it made me cry the whole day, so I think I'ts a bit off limits for now.
* When going out I would film myself to check if I looked presentable and get bummed out when I did not look as good as I saw myself in the mirror. This is just not realistic and I should keep that in mind.
* Bad talk while filming myself. ""My x is too big in this angle.."", i'll keep in mind I'm doing this for myself and no one else.

It was scary at first but each time it got a little bit easier. I'll get to the point where I can film my body and most importantly: let other people voluntarily film/take photos of me, which is my ultimate end goal. Thanks for reading : )",1645159116.0

I’m not even like the plus sized girls with nice figures and pretty faces. I’m just big and ugly. 

I started going to the gym again to desperately try and lose some weight because I’ve gained like 40lbs in a year.

I know people say no one cares and they aren’t paying attention to me but I can’t help but feel like everyone is secretly laughing at me for even trying. 

Even on Instagram and TikTok I try to find fitness accounts to get inspiration but all I end up doing is comparing myself to them. I walk around campus and everywhere there’s a perfect girl rocking gym clothes and looking amazing and I’m just there.

My weight has been my biggest insecurity since forever and even at my smallest I felt disgusting. Now that I’m actually big, I just want to take a knife to all the parts I hate. Cut off the fat in my stomach, thighs, arms, everything. I want to feel dainty and feminine for once. I want to go into a store and not have to walk out crying again because I couldn’t find anything that fit. I feel like if I was smaller then maybe I wouldn’t hate my face as much either. I want to be skinny so bad and maybe I’ll be happy this time. 

I’m tempted to just push through starving myself so I can lose weight quickly and get back to a healthier weight. It’s not like anyone cares if you starve when you’re big. I’d just be doing myself a favor in their eyes.",1645159827.0

Can anyone relate to this?,8,sueqqf,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sueqqf/can_anyone_relate_to_this/,3,"I’ve been suffering with this issue that revolves around being worried about my appearance to a point where it consumes my daily life. 

 I hate my appearance. I feel distraught when looking at myself whether that be in the mirror or in photos with other people. I tend to look in the mirror quite obsessively and I always see flaws that I feel need changing. These episodes take place almost on a daily basis and the best way I can describe it is having this constant regular cycle of bottling things up to a point where I eventually break and get such intrusive and unpleasant thoughts that I have no control over nor can I manage. 

It has led me to neglecting my school work/revising for important exams as well as taking many days off school as my way of attempting to run away from my problems by isolating/avoiding myself from everybody and essentially the outside world, rather than confronting my feelings and being solution oriented.

As a result of this issue, it’s prevented me from being able to maintain good energy and relationships. It’s given me feelings of worthlessness and this inferiority complex that has taken a toll on being able to interact with other people and make friends. It’s also given me an intense lack of motivation in life that’s affected my grades/school life like i’ve previously mentioned.  

However, more significantly it gives me anxiety or what I interpret as anxiety. The worst part is the feeling it gives me throughout my whole body. It really just renders me useless and drives me to not want to attend school or do anything at all. For quite a while I had been disregarding my feelings and lacking in emotional honesty about what I was going through but I've decided to reach out for help in order to understand what’s truly going on with me as well as being able to find a practical solution to help me either manage or cure this. 

I plan on getting therapy before getting any invasive plastic surgeries in order to make sure that I don’t go overboard as well as make sure It’s the right decision. But I do see myself getting plastic surgery. I think the main factor before getting plastic surgery is to try and maintain a good mindset before initially going under the knife. If I’m going to go down this route with a somewhat negative mindset I don’t see how that would make the situation any better.

Anyway since I’ve moved from my hometown to be with my boyfriend his brother has hated me every since I’ve been here and now it’s “your girlfriend is butt ugly everyone in the family makes fun of her and talks about her behind her back. Why do you want to be with her? She’s overweight and just ugly” I’ve overheard his brother try to have a conversations with my boyfriend about how he should break up with me , How he needs to date someone of his own culture (which is Guyanese) I’m not from Guyana but I’ve seen all of his family and everyone one of his sisters and cousins are gorgeous, Which would make sense as to why maybe his family would much rather date someone like that.

My Eye Shape Sends Me Into Depression...,12,stlm3a,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/stlm3a/my_eye_shape_sends_me_into_depression/,1,I literally obsess over this daily. Sometimes my eyelids are small and make my eyes appear smaller while other times my eyelids are higher up and my eyes appear very round. It makes a drastic difference in my appearance because one time I was at a family party and all my distant family members commented on how pretty I am and how big my eyes are while one time I went to the same family party when my eyelids were smaller and nobody commented on anything. I took a side-by-side comparison photo and noticed a drastic difference between the size of my eyes when my eyelid fluctuates. It makes me depressed because I feel I can only look pretty on the days that my eyelid decides to cooperate with me.,1644981744.0

I was never a popular ""girl"" in school. I was never fawned over by the chads/jocks. I had male friends who talked about porn stars in front of me but would say ""not in front of the girls"" when attractive classmates would come by. 

I never wore makeup cause my abusive ex didn't let me, but that wouldn't have made any difference.

I don't have a massive ass or tits and my face is anything but sexy - ffs my stomach is bigger than my ass or tits. 

I have been called ""cute"" but never anything else and that has been rare. 

My dad constantly points out my flaws - calling me dog tits, criticizing my feet, my face he says is sagged like a bulldog, calls me square and without a waist while he has photos of porn stars my age on his phone. 

All my partners have seen porn. Not a single exception.  Yes, even when they know it makes me insecure. 

I've only ever attracted creepy old men or overly pervy men in their 30s. 

No one ever looks at me. It is what it is. I just know my own truth. I only own under 10 photos of myself where i think i look okay and that's cause I have yet to stare at them for more than 5 minutes.",1645000083.0
I’m not sure if I’ve developed BDD or if I was unattractive all along?,1,stvufe,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/stvufe/im_not_sure_if_ive_developed_bdd_or_if_i_was/,3,"I’m 30F and am encountering some distress regarding my physical appearance for the first time in my life.

In my early-mid 20s I received a lot of praise from people around me surrounding my appearance and had some people tell me I was ‘stunning’ and one of the most attractive women they knew. I was in a long term relationship with a really amazing guy at the time who would often butter me up and tell me I was the most ‘beautiful’ girl he’d ever seen etc.

As I entered my mid-late 20s single, I received some similar compliments but after turning 30 I rarely hear anything, even though I look just as young as I did in my mid 20s.

I am wondering if maybe the people around me had been lying/exaggerating my attractiveness all along just to be nice and this has warped my perceived attractiveness for all these years, making me believe I’m more attractive than I actually am.  I also wonder if maybe I might be entering BDD territory as I constantly dread seeing my reflection in the mirror, I hate seeing any photos of myself and rarely have any/post any. I also struggle to put myself out there with dating as I worry that the person I meet will think I’m punching above my weight and I’ll make a fool of myself. This never was the case in my early-mid 20s when I’d easily gain the attention of guys I fancied when I was out and chat to them with ease.

I’m sorry if this sounds super self indulgent and arrogant, I’m just spiralling thinking of all the cosmetic procedures I wish I could afford. Has anyone encountered something similar happen to them later in life?",1645017917.0

Share your story?,7,ste5v6,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/ste5v6/share_your_story/,14,"Hello family. I was hoping to hear other people's stories about their BDD as a means of support. 

What do you think caused it? 

What was life like growing up? 

When do you think it manifested? 

Do you have hope that you'll one day become better?

What steps have you taken towards recovery?

My BDD comes from my childhood. I was severely beaten, molested , neglected, rejected, mistreated and abandoned by the families I grew up with. Naturally I grew up with a number of mental issues but I was always strong. I eventually became a very introspective being and with being aware of myself, I became aware and very observant of others. This is the foundation of my mediator type personality. Although I am over what happened to me, my past affects me today without me having to even think about it. 

I am too stubborn to just accept that this is the way that I am. I refuse to live this way forever. I never give up. Every time something doesn't work for me, I always find the next best thing to try. Right now I am focused on hypnosis. I 100% believe that this is my last experiment. If I change my beliefs, it will change how I feel therefore change how I think; psychological change begats behavioral outcome. I can't afford it right now but when I am able to I'll be sure to let you all know. 🥰 Much love. Looking forward to your stories.",1644961236.0

DAE have complusions like doing your makeup over and over?,4,stdhde,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/stdhde/dae_have_complusions_like_doing_your_makeup_over/,1,"This thing has a hold of me. It manifests in many ways but some days I get really sucked into the compulsion to draw my eyebrows on, and wipe them off and draw them on over and over and over for hours. I wont let myself eat or leave the room until I look half normal. My bdd personally is centred around looking like a man, and feeling like I'm not a girl and really wanting to be a girl. I have a flat chest, my dad's huge nose, and eyebrows are a big determiner of how your face looks therefore something I really fixate on. Done wrong, too thick, too dark, too wide, they can make you look completely like a man. So I have to make sure theyre as thin and arched as possible. When I put other makeup on like mascara, fake lashes, lipstick, I can get through the day. I'm still in agony about my appearance but I dont feel an absolute compelling urge to draw my eyebrows over and over because I think the rest of my makeup helps me look a bit more feminine. But on my no makeup days, when it's just me, my bare face and my eyebrows, the urges take over me. Because there's nothing else like lips or eyes to distract from my huge nose so my eyebrows need to be as thin as possible so I dont look really manly. And even when they look fine I still keep feeling the need to try and draw them better because 10 mins later I'll look in the mirror and be like no I still look like a man. And then that's my whole day just doing my eyebrows over and over and over. I once counted the amount of times I wiped off and drew my eyebrows back on one time it was 52 times. But I'm sure I've done it more other days. Anyone else get strong compulsions related to your appearance or am I just super weird?",1644959475.0

will never be pretty enough,32,sssnnu,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sssnnu/will_never_be_pretty_enough/,4,"sometimes i’m okay with my appearance, until i remember that there are girls who are infinitely more beautiful than i’ll ever be and it’s so frustrating. 

the boy i’ve been talking apparently rlly likes me and after about 6 months, i still cannot comprehend how he finds me attractive when there are many other girls to pick from. i fear that one day he’ll finally realize how average i look and just start losing interest.

i also thing he’s just way out of my league, i seriously can’t fathom how such an attractive person finds me attractive as well, so part of me contemplates distancing myself before he comes to his senses and ghosts me.

he’s the first boy who’s genuinely showed interest in me (without entertaining anyone else) so this all just seems like a too good to be true scenario",1644894010.0

About twenty minutes later I feel the presence of my friend behind me with his phone. He smiles and says, he had to get some candid photos of me near the sunset. Because “everyone looks good near the sunset”

YAll. I don’t like posed pictures let alone CANDIDS. I could have died. Later he sent them to me in a private message and told me that he respects me and deleted them off his phone. Which like yay thanks for that. 

Of course I look at the photos which were repulsive. I am hunched over trying to hear an audio message on my phone. My forehead is scrunched and my teeth are protruding from my mouth. My forehead weirdly convex. Honestly made me sick and put me in a mood for the rest of the night.

WHAT THE NORMALS NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT US,80,sselk4,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sselk4/what_the_normals_need_to_understand_about_us/,16,"We aren't **fatphobic**. Yes, that's right, even those of us with EDs. You're not our psychologists or psychiatrists so stop trying to come up with explanations to why we are mentally ill - this goes for the TikTok people trying to come up with reasons to call people with EDs and BDD fatphobic and accusing us of ""itnernalised fatphobia"". Just the same way no two snowflakes are patterned the same way, people's lives are also different, meaning that there can be many reasons for illness or seemingly none. Stop playing armchair psychologist ffs.

We aren't concerned with the appearances of others. This isn't about YOU at all. We could see the beauty in others, yes even beauty within whatever people consider ""average"" or ""under average"" or ""unconventional"" or ""ugly"" , but never within ourselves.

We aren't vain. Mirror checking isn't a narcissistic thing - we aren't fawning over ourselves, our minds are racing with thoughts and feelings ranging from sadness to anger to disgust and hopelessness and a whole array of complex emotions.

If we could ""***just love ourselves""*** and not be mentally ill, we would all choose to be free of this disorder, but unfortunately it isn't as simple and complex and often chronic disorders like these need extensive work in order for real and permanent betterment to occur. 

Understand that when we say we don't believe you, we aren't trying to hurt you. We appreciate your efforts, but please understand our minds are our enemies and depending on how severe our illness is, that's how difficult it will be to believe you.

Please stop saying shit like, "" ***we all get insecure sometimes.""*** and ***""there is beauty in your uniqueness""***. Shit like that won't get through to us and on top of that you are being allistic and diminishing our struggle with a REAL ILLNESS.

Don't compare us to ANYONE. Good or bad comparisons. Any comparison will make us over analyze our bodies and can even ruin our whole day and send us into crisis. Just don't talk about appearances around us, especially if you know we haven't been well as of late.

realise that this is a real illness. realise that it is incredibly serious. get informed. learn the stats.

stop being selfish for once and think that not everything is about you.",1644855981.0

I always thought I was fat until I actually got fat. Over the last few years I've put on 50 pounds from depression, anxiety, and insomnia as the result of my emotional eating. I'm 5'1 and used to be 130 lbs, ballooning too 180 lbs has absolutely destroyed me from the inside out. I absolutely hate my body and can't help but compare mine to all the skinny girls on my college campus. I live in the type of body they're deathly afraid of. I live in the type of body they work their asses off in the gym to not get. I live in the type of body they would kill themselves over if it looked like mine.

I've tried starving myself and eating significantly less but I always end up binging on my favorite food because I'm gonna restrict myself from it for a long time. It's an endless loop. I regret buying a bus ticket to see my family for a photoshoot. I haven't lost the weight for it like I wanted to between when I found out about a year ago and now. I don't want to hear the comments from family members about my weight gain, even though they're a lot heavier than me. I don't want to look at the hideous photos of my now fat body. I think I'm gonna cancel the ticket and make up an excuse on why I can't go, but my family already booked the hotel room with an extra bed to accommodate my attendance. What should I do? Should I still go, but just say I'm not comfortable taking photos? Would that be considered rude considering how much my family spent on a professional photographer?

My jaw grew abnormally during puberty. My upper and left lower jaw is completely normal, but my right lower jaw is around an inch longer than it should be. I feel like it makes me look so manly and I hate the way my face looks from that side. It's all I can think about whenever anyone is looking at me from the right. I feel like it interferes with my quality of life more than anything else, yet the surgery to fix it would be incredibly expensive and invasive for what my orthodontist considers a 'mild case'. But what can I do to overcome it otherwise? I hate it so much and it makes me hate myself so much. People tell me they barely notice it and wouldn't even have if I hadn't pointed it out, but it's so obvious to me in pictures and in the mirror and stuff. I feel like while they might not actively notice it, they do sub-consciously. If that makes any sense. I just hate it hate it hate it so so so so so so much. It makes my chin deviate to the left, and throws my face off balance. I have to actively try to smile evenly on both sides so that my features don't look asymmetrical, because when I smile I naturally smile less on my right side since that's where my jaw is longer.

If it’s not the BDD it’s a flashback back. if it’s not a flashback it’s bad news. If it’s not bad news it’s me destroying things. A vicious cycle, over and over and over again.

I’m a religious person. There’s no one else that I’m as angry at as I am with God. Why am I still alive when all I do is suffer? Every single day I suffer and I’m made to go through the day, barely keeping it together. How cruel to not give me peace. Maybe he hates me too. If he doesn’t give me peace soon then.

Every night I go to sleep and wish that my final eternal sleep will come. Every day that I wake up and open my eyes, I pray that it gets better. That something is going to change. I just can’t do this anymore. I’m so tired.

My therapist told me to be “in the moment” when I have bad episodes so that’s why I’m writing. I have to write because I forget almost everything about the episode. It’s like a distant memory even though it would prob just have been a couple hours that has passed.

If you asked me if I see myself living until I’m 25 I’d laugh. I don’t know if I’ll make it through another year let alone 4.

Like for example I've had mental breakdowns for ridiculous things like not being 6'3+ ft.  tall even though I'm already 6'1 ft. or having a little bit too much upper eyelid exposure. Not only that BDD has caused me to waste hours in front of the mirror pretty much everyday analyzing every single part of my face.  I'm in constant fear that I will find a flaw that will make me think I'm ugly.

It won't even leave me after I go outside because I find myself constantly analyzing other people's faces and comparing their features to mine.

I start to get flooded with thoughts like ""If I had a girlfriend right now and she saw this guy, she would probably leave me for him and not love me anymore.""

I'm  tired of people on TikTok making it sound like some vain disorder or  having an allistic approach and saying shit like, ""everyone gets  insecure sometimes"". No, this shit has ruined my life and it has  progressively gotten worse and worse and I am 23. I get told that these  are the best years of my life, but how am I supposed to live them if  this thing has consumed me?I get body shamed by my own family even after  I had an eating disorder when I was younger - my face is criticized, my  boobs, my body, and honestly I am sick of it. Being told I have ""dog  tits"" and having my father take pictures of me to show me how fat I have  gotten while I know he is out here with some insane body standard cause  he sees porn of women my age. Being told my face is so fat and saggy  and comparing me to bulldog like ffs, what am I supposed to feel when  this is my reality?

I'm sorry I  don't shower sometimes for days on end, but I can't handle seeing myself  naked. I've covered up all the mirrors I have access to, but it's hard  not to end up seeing my reflection in windows or even on the god damn  microwave-oven door.

Tomorrow is  Valentine's Day and I am already terrified about what I'm gonna be  looking like when I eventually see my gf. The worst part is that she  tells me I am beautiful, but I can't accept that. I don't believe anyone  because to me beauty means being objectively beautiful - and despite  seeing the beauty in others, I just can't see anything in myself.

This  disorder has made me want to unalive myself several times in my  lifetime - I just wish people would stop seeing it as a joke or some  vain or ""fathphobic"" bullshit.

I  hope some day I won't feel this way. I hope one day I can get the  extensive therapy I need. I hope I can see myself the way others do.

And it’s not that I think my face is “ugly” by definition, it's just that it doesn't feel like it's my face, it's not the face I see whenever I picture myself in my head, and that makes it feel so much uglier than it actually is. And I just can’t avoid it, because everytime i think about myself or how other people see me, it only gets worse, and it makes me want to constantly isolate myself so that nobody can see me and associate me with a face that isn’t mine. And I can't take pictures without hating them because everytime i see it I think “it's not right,” and it’s gotten to the point where I don't do things and I don’t make memories or have friends or date because I just feel so wrong all the time. It's gotten to the point where all I want to do is start my whole life over, and it keeps me from wanting to move forward in this life that I already have.

I’ve considered plastic surgery, because if I could just change a few things then it would all be fine, and I think that the reason it’s so hard to find things I'm happy with is because they’re all connected. I have deep bags under my eyes that are probably genetic or because of all those years I spent with horrible depression, and I can’t stand it because I’ve started getting better and the bags are still there, but if they weren’t then maybe I wouldn’t hate my cheeks which are so overshadowed by the bags under my eyes. Maybe I could even love my cheeks if I could change my nose to be less long, causing all those little lines and wrinkles because it takes up so much of my face. Maybe I could like my forehead if my eyes were less hooded and my eyebrows were less low, maybe I could love my lips if they weren’t so overshadowed by my nose. Maybe I could love my jaw if my long nose didn’t distort the perceived shape of my face and made it look all long and uneven. And whenever I see people who look like I feel like I should look, I just get so jealous because it's not fair. It’s not fair that I can’t look like that just because I was unlucky enough to get a crappy combination of random genetics.

The only thing is that I don’t want to want plastic surgery. I know how expensive and dangerous plastic surgery is, and how it might not work, and how it might just make me even more unsatisfied and leave me wanting more surgeries. But I can’t stop wanting it. I want to be confident, I want to walk around and know that my face makes me happy, but I have no idea how to feel that away about my current face, because if it’s even possible to overcome that, it would be super difficult and probably take years and years of therapy, and I don’t want to spend all that time being unhappy and unable to move forward.

I’ve started seeing a therapist, but it hasn’t been long and while I’ve mentioned this to her I don't think she quite understands. Because yes, a decent amount of this is routed in self loathing, from never being the pretty one and never having anyone approach you and knowing that people were talking about you behind your back, because they did that thing where they pretended to be nice and then kept giggling to themselves, which might not have had anything to do with the way I look and was more about my unsociable personality. But that’s not all there is to it. I’ve had bad depression and anxiety, but I’ve started getting better. I'm doing so much better than I was before, and if anything I think it makes my dysmorphia worse, because everytime I see myself, I see who I was and not who I am now. It can ruin a good day when I feel great and look in a mirror and I’m suddenly hit with the crushing reality that the happy image of myself that I have in my head, is not how I actually look. It just makes me want to hit my head against a wall until I manage to rearrange my face in the right way. So at this point it feels like plastic surgery is my only option if I want to be happy anytime soon and not spiral into getting worse again. But it scares me so much, it scares me that people will judge me and that I won’t be satisfied and I’ll only want to change more. It scares me that I might start to feel the same way about any changes I make as I do about my face right now.

I always hear people talk about how plastic surgery didn’t help and they still weren’t happy after that, but I feel like I’m in that “I'm different” mindset, because everytime I see someone talk about their journey to loving themself, it sounds so much different than mine. So I’m mostly wondering if anyone here has ever felt the same way and what you managed to do about it. Like is my experience pretty similar to others and I just don’t see it for some reason? Is there something I can do to make it easier?

Tldr

I feel like my face doesn’t reflect who I am, and it's holding me back because I can't be myself if I don't feel like myself. I’m considering plastic surgery because I feel like if I just change a few things, then I’ll be able to love all the things that were connected because it's not distorted by all the things I’m unsatisfied with. But I’m scared that I’m going down the wrong path.",1644862839.0

Core issue,3,ssdffj,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/ssdffj/core_issue/,0,"I've recently realized (although deep inside I've probably always known) that my body image is the cause of my social anxiety disorder. 

I was pretty much bullied by my brother when I was younger, namecalling me cause of my rounder shaped head. Being called out for behaving ""wrong"" chewing loud. Generally hating on his 2 year younger brother. All while feeling alot of love for him and looking up to him as a little kid.

This has stuck with me for such a long time I am 27 now and it's still something that affects me daily.

afraid to talk to therapist/pdoc about body image bc of fear of drawing attention to flaws,18,ss02q8,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/ss02q8/afraid_to_talk_to_therapistpdoc_about_body_image/,4,"does anyone else here have this issue?? it's the best way i can explain it, i know there are many things that might keep someone from expressing their issues w their appearance, but i'm curious as to whether being scared that pointing out the flaws will make people think less of you is a common reason

it really sucks because i think the way i view my physical being is a major component of why i am unhappy/undee the belief that i'm innately less than and unworthy of living... and i can't/won't talk about it, so my therapist can't really ""help"" me when i am hiding so much

But yesterday he decided me to show his whole face and he's definitely above average in the looks department. He is really pretty. After he showed me his face all of a sudden he feels very unfamiliar and very out of my league. I feel like I don't deserve being friends with him because I'm ugly. I feel like I'm deceiving him because my brain is like he'd def block me if he saw my face. Also even though he's a guy I feel envy when I look at his face. I'm so jealous of his pretty eyes and skin I literally wanna cry. I wanted to meet him irl someday but now I just wanna block him and never associate with him again I feel so awful.,1644794454.0

Either my tops are too loose, too tight, too long or too short. What should i do then, at the time of buying she would be fine with what i bought then after few months, she would be like you look fat, dont wear this shirt, like why didnt you tell me that before. She would then taunt me for not knowing how to dress for my size like as if i embarrassed myself. I dont know what to wear now because of this and i dont feel comfortable in anything because of those comments. So ive opted for some old frequently worn hoodies, if i wear anything else, i would get comments from my mom. I dont know what to wear when she literally has problems with 90 percent of what i wear. I cant leave the house as i know im humiliating myself as i must've worn something unflattering.  Either my tops are too baggy, if not then either not loose enough, or either too long or not long enough,  i cant win either ways. Its just frustrating and aggravating, she still doesnt get that though, if i were to call her out on this, i just get callled sensitive or i get offended by everything when i asked are many times before in the changing room if it looked good on me, she said that time it looked fine now months later, your telling i look fat now. I can gaurantee you that same thing will happen to the new top i bought days ago, as she told me yesterday i look fine, probably months later she would be telling me i look fat dont wear that just like every other thing ive worn, this will stay in my closet abandoned as well.

I’m sick of it. I look in the mirror sometimes and think I look okay, then I take a photo and I look completely different, the facetime video is 10 times worse. I can’t tell which one I actually look like. I can’t trust my own eyes and it sucks. I feel hideous and gross.

"""It's not like that in real life""",12,srym8a,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/srym8a/its_not_like_that_in_real_life/,4,"I used to tell myself this, too. So I could try to cheer me up. ""Women like this are a minority and only exist in media"" but as I have been going out more (was a shut-in) and see hundreds of people every day, it could not be more wrong.

On average, I would say I see 120-200 people ONLY going from the subway to my university and out of those people maybe only 5 are more on the chubbier side. And of those 5, 3 have more or less skins problems that are on the lowest spectrum of cellulite and stretch marks (all those 5 are able to wear revealing clothes, which amazes me). Every single girl I see, have perfect bodies. 

These are young, but I also see way too many old women that have better bodies than me. I assume at least a high % have given birth and yet they have bodies that fit standards so well.

I scrolled through his Instagram followers,32,sroh81,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sroh81/i_scrolled_through_his_instagram_followers/,13,"I don’t know how to express all this, so I’m just gonna dump it all out. Advice is really much needed, especially if you’ve had a similar experience. I made this new account just so my bf wouldn’t find me posting this. 

I’m in a new relationship right now, we got together back in October after being really good friends for some time. He is very conventionally attractive. Fit, tall, beautiful blonde hair and blue eyes, perfect lips, perfect everything really. And a lot of other people definitely feel the same (including my best friend who had a huge crush on him when we first got together). 

My BDD has been really quiet for some time now, because I’ve been burying myself in schoolwork and other responsibilities. I made especially sure that my BDD would stay silent especially now that im in this relationship, because I don’t want to ruin what I have with him. I’ve never ever told him about this, and I’ve never even once mentioned anything insecurity or BDD related. Like in the beginning, when he called me cute or gorgeous, I wouldn’t try to even remotely express insecurity or argue what he said. I’m terrified he’ll leave once he finds out. 

I have no idea how this happened though. I was doing so well, but then, suddenly, out of nowhere my BDD hit me so hard last week. And then I started to think of things, like how he doesn’t ever compliment me anymore (since… October when we first got together). He doesn’t ever tell me I’m pretty, even if we’re going out somewhere and I try to doll myself up (literally spending hours checking myself in the mirror). He’ll compliment like if my outfit is nice or my shoes are cool, but he never calls me pretty. But the problem is, he’s so sweet and kind and social with others, and he does the same thing too where he compliments their outfits, or their shoes or their hats (like other girls too), and it makes me feel not special. Cuz he doesn’t do anything other than that with me anyways.  

I don’t want to ask him to compliment me. I don’t want to admit that. I love to tell him he’s so good looking and so cute and how his hair has been looking so nice lately (sometimes he gets irked how messy it’s been looking). But I can’t even remember the last time he called me pretty. And if I ask him to compliment me more, it would just be forced. And that makes my heart sink.  

I was on vacation recently, too, and I was posting selfies and pictures. He never even acknowledged them. He didn’t like them, comment on it, absolutely nothing. I figured maybe he was just busy, and that’s totally okay. He’s not the kind to spend lots of time on social media. But then… ever since my BDD has been acting crazy, I’ve been convincing myself that he’s lost all attraction in me. And that maybe it isn’t because he’s not a social media guy, but because he just found no reason to compliment those pictures of mine or say anything. Because there was nothing to compliment to begin with.  

And it didn’t help either that a couple days we had s3x, and he didn’t touch me. He didn’t look at me. We just had s3x, he finished, and he went silent on me. I’m crying even now feeling so ashamed of my body. S3x before wasn’t like this. 

And then yesterday, I made the absolute worst mistake ever. I went through his follower list on Instagram. He has a lot of friends that are girls, which is okay. It doesn’t bother me. Except when I actually looked, they’re the pretty girls at my university that are absolutely stunning models. And they look EXACTLY like how I wish I did. Perfect bodies, beautiful faces, incredible hair, they’re the cool pretty girls. Something I’m not and can’t ever be. 

 I went through almost every one of these girls he was following. And I saw how he liked even their very scandalous pictures (which, power to them, especially if they have that confidence!!! I sure as hell don’t. But of course it made me feel more jealous and insecure). But more importantly,  these pictures they had posted were almost around the exact same time I had MY pictures posted. Which means he just ignored mine, saw theirs, and acknowledged theirs. 

I’ve been nonstop crying wishing he would just leave me already  because I don’t deserve him. He’s so much better, and I’m pretty sure he wishes he was with someone prettier too. Someone whose body is so much better than mine. I’ve gained a little weight since we got together and I know that’s probably what’s making him lose attraction in me. 

And I wish I gained weight in the right places too. I have very very small boobs, no butt, no hips, no waist. And my face doesn’t even make up for it either. I’ve been nonstop picking my skin since last night, making everything so much worse. I’ll never feel beautiful in any relationship I’m in. I can’t even imagine this one will be any different. 

I worked so hard to at least be numb to this. And now I’m back to where I started. A pathetic, ugly girl.

Please help me. What do I do. What would you do if you were in my place. Am I just deluding myself because of my BDD?",1644774761.0

some tips for acne and scarring,6,srtirg,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/srtirg/some_tips_for_acne_and_scarring/,0,"i pick at my face incessantly and pop sebaceous filaments, whiteheads, blackheads, etc., which is sooo bad for your skin because it traumatizes the pores which can increase their appearance, but it's one of my compulsions.

for anyone else dealing with something similar, two greatly effective, cheap, and natural solutions are pure aloe vera gel, which minimizes scarring, heals skin and moisturizes, and saline solution (salt water) which naturally draws bacteria out of the skin. 

all you need to make a saline solution is sea salt or non-iodized salt and distilled water. aloe vera leaves can usually be purchased at grocery stores or you can get pure gel from walmart/the drugstore. aloe vera also helps minimize the appearance of self harm scars and stretch marks.

I can lose all the weight I want but my shape will always be wrong and my face will always be ugly. If I really am as pretty as I thought I was just this morning my mentality would not have been destroyed in the course of a day.

I know it was a bad move to post on /amiugly but I truly wasn't expecting negative comments, like that's how up my own arse I was. I wasn't even my first time posting there and I should've known better considering the prevailing conclusion from that last time was ""plain, bland, needs to lose weight"" which also made me spiral.

There is also no one else I can ask for their opinion because my friends and family are all sick and tired of my obsession with my looks and also they never be honest because they have an agenda, which is to make me calm down.",1644769556.0

Knowing that I should feel like a black goddess , I don’t. Believe me when I say guys love black women they love the ones that look like Rihanna or something. As a black woman if you don’t look like that you’re considered ugly or unattractive maybe even average… So society tells us we should up keep ourselves the way we know how. Baby listen when im going somewhere I dress comfortable and I be myself , when I walk I walk like I got somewhere to be and yet I still get told that I need to smile more or if I don’t I’ll stay looking ugly?

My biggest obsession is my teeth and gums,3,srvwyd,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/srvwyd/my_biggest_obsession_is_my_teeth_and_gums/,3,I have periodontitis and as a result my gums have receded and exposed the tooth roots and I feel extremely disgusted by the sight of it and I also have a lot of health anxiety about it since it increases the risk of heart disease and many other health issues. One of my biggest fears is that my gums are going to recede even more. I do my very best to keep gum disease under control but I know that it progresses very essily once some irreversible damage has been done so I constantly worry about it. Some days my anxiety is manageable but other days it's so severe that I can't even function and feel like there's no point continuing life. I usually avoid looking at my teeth because I know that's best for my functioning and well-being but once in a while I feel the urge to check my teeth to make sure my gums haven't gotten worse. That's always a bad idea though because I get extremely triggered.,1644794250.0

My entire life I've struggled with looking not only boyish,but also way too old for my age. Seriously,when I was 10,I was so overdeveloped that I had to wear mostly adults' clothing. I wish I had a dainty,petite and feminine body and a cute baby face,but no,I was cursed with a broad bone structure,huge *ss hands and feet,small b00bs,a head that is way too small for my huge body,a cleft chin that makes my face look deformed,permanent dark circles under eyes,grey and dull skin,and a huge nose bump. I also am very underweight and my square jaw sticks out even more. It doesn't help that my mom forces me to wear hairclips,which just makes my face look even more square shaped. My biggest insecurity is my neck,it's literally as wide as my head! 
When I saw a photo of me with a bunch of my clammates,I was shocked at how deformed I looked compared to the other girls. First,I saw a bunch of girls with cute round faces and big eyes,and then I saw myself,looking like a boy with long hair.

I hate all my clothes and I always hate how I look in everything but I just keep getting more clothes hoping Something will make me feel good. I want to wear lingerie and feel cute and send pics to my bf. But I know he’s already seen so many people with better bodies wear the same clothes. I want to have sex but when I see my body all I can do is compare it to the  people he always watches and want to cry. I can’t masterbate because all I do is think about him and then compare myself to what he masterbates too. He’s been spending the night at my house for a few days. Even when he’s with me he has to masterbate 1-3 times a day, and I just saw he’s been looking up this huge chested girl of course. I hate my body all I want is for someone to be actually sexually attracted to me. I want to feel good about myself I just want to feel enough.

A year ago, I started video recording myself trying on swim suits. I was so bummed out over myself that I ended up having a tummy tuck in October. I felt amazing.... Told my husband, if I could just have a tummy tuck, I would finally be comfortable in my own skin. I loved my results.

Until, I recorded myself again trying on swim suits. In my mind, I look better, but still don't know how I feel about being in a swim suit. I am 5'10"" and just feel like a giant, awkward blob of a person.

I can look at a ""normal"", healthy female and think she looks amazing in a swimsuit, but the second I see myself (essentially the same size), I pick my poor body apart.

The fact that they were all so disgusted and so shocked anyone could find it sexy. 

That is what happens when you go in a normal nsfw sub. Your average male thinks very poorly of labia like mine. I feel so disgusting and abnormal. The most feminine and intimate part of me is ugly. I could never be confident or have a normal sex life or relationship.

But many people recover from BDD or learn to reduce the symptoms to the point where they don't play a role in their everyday life. Remember that a mental disorder is not a life long sentence but rather something that can be managed and recovered from.

I think I have BDD. I feel like my brain is in a fog and every second I can only think about my appearance and how fast I am aging.

However, I recently turned 30 and my obsessing has amped up to a whole new level. For a few years I travelled solo around Asia after turning 26. I was the most confident version of myself during these years. I didn’t have time to think about myself, I only wanted to explore and meet new people. When the pandemic began I had to return home and leave behind that life. It took me some time to adjust to being back in my own country after having had so many different cultural experiences overseas. I began noticing a strange feeling in my left eye after some months, but I ignored it. It was not until I drank too much gin one night and freaking face planted onto a wooden floor that I began to take more notice of the odd feeling. I broke my nose that night and whilst it did not seem displaced at the time - I began noticing the damage a few months later and obsessing over it. I started having more eye problems and began moving my nose around trying to line it back up in the hopes that it would fix my eye (after somehow becoming convinced the two were related).

Fast forward to nearly two years after the fall, and I am now almost unrecognisable to the person I was a few years ago. My nose is crooked, my left eye has sunken into my cheekbone and some days I can even feel my cheek sagging down my face. I feel and sometimes look like I have a lazy eye and my smile is starting to droop. I guess what I’m wondering is, why have I begun to notice these issues within such a short time frame? Can BDD become heightened after a fall that noticeably changes face shape - or is it likely the changes are minor and I’m just overly aware of them? My parents don’t notice a difference in my face but some of my friends and strangers I meet comment on my eye looking lazy (of course such conflicting reports confuse me more). I believe I do look drastically different it’s just that I’m the only one so focused on the changes. I can’t even sleep because I can feel asymmetry with my eyes closed even more! I’m literally going crazy. I keep pulling on my face and raising my eyebrows hoping to restore some life to my face. What is going on?!",1644748287.0

kiiiiinda wanna die tbh,36,sr07hl,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sr07hl/kiiiiinda_wanna_die_tbh/,17,"I feel like a lot of people assume if you have body dysmorphia that you probably aren't actually fat but you just see yourself that way. But what happens when you are actually overweight? What do all the well-meaning people who were saying ""oh you're not fat, you're totally normal xoxo"" say then? Because you literally are. It's not in your head, the number on the scale proves it.

I'm somehow too big and not big enough. I'm a 5'4"" man with basically no muscle. 225 lbs I'm like... Too compressed. If I was a foot taller, or even half a foot, I might not be so bothered by my weight. But my arms are flabby, my shoulders are small, I have boobs on my front and backside and my legs are thick and tiny. My face has been completely broken out in acne for months and no matter what skincare I try it doesn't go away. I don't have to be a body builder mega chad, but sheesh, I look like an effeminate slobby pig.

""so why don't you just go to the gym and work off your excessive fat and build muscle you lazy fat f***"" you're probably thinking. And like? You're right? You're absolutely right. That's exactly what I should do. But I don't. I go to school (or I'm supposed to, the past few days I've sleep till 1pm instead.) I go to work, then I go on the internet after I get home until I go to sleep. I could make time for even a short work out. But I just self-loathe/pity instead.

When I look in the mirror... All I can see is a loser. A guy that could have been more but wastes everything that was given to me. I eat and drink my problems away. Or try to. They don't go away. I want to just stop eating entirely, or go back to the days a few years ago where I would force myself to throw up after every meal. At least when I was doing that I was actually losing weight, I got down to 170 lbs. Then everything went to s*** when the virus broke loose and I gained over 50 pounds.

My doctor said that if I keep heavily drinking, I'll not only gain more weight but my liver will shut down. At the rate I'm going I will drink myself to death before I'm 30. So that alarmed me, and I tried to stop for about a month or so. But now I'm just thinking of saying f*** it and keep going and if I die, I die. I was driving drunk the other day and trashed my car. I wasn't injured but God do I wish that accident had killed me.

It doesn't help when I go online and I see other guys who are well built or women talking about how they would never date a short fat guy. My last boyfriend cheated on me and it's no wonder why, I am disgusting inside and out. I want someone to love me romantically and I honestly don't care if they were a man or a woman and I keep trying to establish connections with people but no one wants to talk to me. Or they're already taken.

My beard only grows on my neck, or should I say triple chin, in patches and it looks gross and sloppy. I wish I had a real beard. I wish I was a real man instead of whatever pathetic excuse for a lump of too much flesh that I am. I wish I could look in the mirror and not wanna punch it and cut my arms open with the shards until I bleed to death.

Oh well. Life goes on and we all pretend everything is fine, for some reason.",1644697000.0

The pandemic spoiled me because I was able to mask (literally) my biggest insecurity. Unfortunately soon I won’t be able to do that. What doesn’t help is I have a relatively large sized nose and large lips too. I remember a couple months ago in school I took my mask off for a bit and overheard a kid say to another kid how I look like a fish and how I look like I suck mad dick because of my large lips hanging over my tiny chin. Ngl it made me laugh but it multiplied my insecurity by 10 because up till then no one ever said anything about it and my family kept on telling me it was all in my head but that confirmed it for me.

I hated my curls and wanted to straighten it, I felt like I looked like an electrocuted dog. It was so frizzy and short and uneven. It probably looked the same to others but I felt so ugly.

Yesterday I was with someone, and they said that my body reminds them of a marble sculpture. I asked them what they meant, and they said specifically my hips and thighs. I was surprised and told them I hated my hips, and they were shocked. 

This interaction made me think about my body in a different way and appreciate my hip dips in a new perspective. I never learned to see an ounce of appeal in them due to my mindset. I have this very strict and detailed ideal of “beauty” and what I want my body to look like in my head, I don’t even try appreciate anything about my body for the way it is. I need to remember that other people have their own (completely different) ideas of beauty as well, and that have I many things that I should learn to be at peace with about myself.

I get complimented about my looks by strangers and friends alike. I'm not a stud but i'v been with attractive girls, although i have body dysmorphia since early teen and i cant see myself in pictures otherwise i might spiral into depression and i have no idea how attractive i am. I dress very dapper and i groom myself almost obsessively, i cant stand going out if i dont take my time to groom myself.

I cant deal not being considered physically attractive. I dont care if they find my personality interesting or if they think i'm an A.hole, it's only about look. When i go out my only focus is to garner female attraction, attention or compliments about my look. I get bored otherwise.

If a girl reject me i need to know if it was because of my look or my vibe/personality/whatever ( in that the case i dont care at all). When a girl accept me i have this urge of knowing if it was about my look that attracted her (i dont tell her because that would make me lose points).

Anyone else recovering from their femcel/incel days lol,11,sqcdsl,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sqcdsl/anyone_else_recovering_from_their_femcelincel/,1,"I definitely lurked on the trufemcels subreddit back when it was around; it was one of the only places where I saw people like me being open and honest about their experiences of ""ugliness""/desirability. I thought I was a freak for being a woman who had never dated, never kissed, never been called beautiful or given compliments on my appearance, never had anyone ask me out, always been rejected when I asked others out. It was refreshing seeing that I wasn't a freak of nature or a reject from society; so many other women my age had been experiencing similar things... and it felt amazing to be among those who just understood what it was like. To be... ugly. Or at the very least, perceived as such. Treated as such!! The kids who grew up into adults who never grew into themselves. 

Sometimes, I do find myself missing that community simply because it was the first and only place where I saw women talk about being ""ugly."" In hindsight, regardless of whether these women were ugly or not, I see that lots of these people were suffering from BDD. I think incel communities unfortunately appeal to people with BDD; most of us are very aware of lookism and how it affects everyone's lives, and we gravitate towards talking about it and affirming our worst perceptions of it because... hey, we have BDD, and it's a compulsion we feel we have to satisfy. For as much as I miss the sense of camaraderie that community provided to me, I also feel deeply disturbed by how low I felt at such a formative point in my adolescence and how the sentiments expressed in that subreddit shaped my views of myself and others. Like, in a huge way that affects me to this day. I still feel paranoia about men and their intentions, believing most men to be looks-obsessed people who cannot value a woman as a friend, as a human being unless she is servicing them with her appearance. I still feel like my main worth is how I look. It's hard to explain how I lost so much to that community but also how that community gave me a sustenance that I really needed at the time??

I'm seeking therapy now, and my boyfriend has been immensely supportive about it. We have a really strong relationship, and I'm grateful he is in my life.
I knew this a while ago, but before he met me he wanted a relationship with an asian woman. Then realised how silly that was.
Recently he told me how at times he compares me to pretty featured women, particularly asian women. He also told me how he realises how lucky he is to have me soon after the fact. And has told me that he wants to work towards not doing this, because it hurts me a lot.
I kind of had the feeling he did this, but have shrugged the thought off because of my BDD. But yep, I was right... I was right and I don't know how to feel about this. I told him how much it triggers me, and I'm glad he wants to work towards it now. Despite that, just thinking about what he has told me still makes me want to burst into tears.

I (16M) have always been worried about my weight, in not fat, whenever I weigh myself I am exactly 50kg,  I'm 5'2, so that's a normal weight for someone my height. Last year, I also got gynocomastia, which has ruined me. I can't go swimming, even though I really want to. In school, I've psyched myself into constantly wearing a coat on top of my blazer, and when the teacher tells me to take it off, I get incredibly anxious even though I still have a blazer over my shirt. I constantly feel like I'm getting looked at for fat rolls that aren't even there.

Whenever I'm out with friends, even on a hot day, I wear a coat or shirt, cause I can't stand the thought of anyone seeing me in just a shirt cause of my chest and stomach. Looking back as I'm reading this, there is never a time when I'm not thinking about it in social situations, it's constant, the only time I ever feel somewhat confident is at home when I'm sat down. 

Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I feel great, I think to myself that I'm not fat in any way, and I look perfectly normal, and my face looks great and I look my age (which I know I don't, I've been on hormones to boost puberty cause I'm late), but other times I feel like a fat and ugly 12 year old.

I feel trapped all the time and I can't go out with my friends without constantly pulling down my shirt or hunching over to hide myself.

I don't really know what I'm expecting with this, I guess I just need some reassurance or advice really, thanks :)",1644621116.0

I wish we were taught proper nutrition and physical health in school,11,spyl6s,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/spyl6s/i_wish_we_were_taught_proper_nutrition_and/,0,"For example, up until very recently, if i ate anything that was unhealthy (even a small chocolate bar) i’d think that genuinely added fat to me. Even now, if i eat a piece of chocolate, it feels like i’ve gotten fatter. Like you’d just gain weight any time you ate unhealthy. and i never had any education to contradict this. Along with the BDD, my view of how health and weight gain works was completely distorted. I am SURE if i knew, for example, that weight gain is primarily affected by calories consumed, not the type of food, i would not have been so rough on myself. 

I’m SURE if i was taught about bloating and water retention, i wouldn’t have had as many breakdowns and painful days thinking about how fat i am. 

I’m not saying this education would just cure me. But rather, it would at least give me some grounding to resist the BDD. But, no, instead we were shown some documentaries that basically said sugar is evil and it’s in everything so watch out! We were given incredibly minimal education on eating and body disorders. When we got taught about anorexia we had to sit through a 5 min youtube video that was just disturbing pictures of incredibly anorexic people. After being given the definition and being told the usual “hey this isn’t good for you pls speak up” generic BS, we moved on. Nothing about how guys can have body image issues as well. As a guy who was obsessed with being skinny, this would have helped. I’ve been skinny my whole life but i always thought i was fat. Literally obsessed over having a thigh gap everyday (even tho i had one, i just didn’t believe it).

There is no such this as delusional or non-delusional BDD.,5,spv62z,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/spv62z/there_is_no_such_this_as_delusional_or/,4,"There has been a lot of use lately of terms “delusional” and “non-delusional” BDD. 

It’s very important to correct this:   

**There is no such thing as delusional or non-delusional BDD** in any official medical literature. 


**There is however BDD with good insight, and poor insight.**

This means that, with **poor insight**, the person with BDD is convinced that all their issues are real and their distress is reasonable and a normal reaction to their perceived flaw. 

With **good insight**, the person knows that their feelings and view of themselves is affected by a mental disorder (BDD) and it’s not fully accurate and they are more open to treatment. 

One can be in between these levels of insight.

People’s appearance has no role in the severity of BDD nor the type of symptoms one experiences. 

By definition, everyone who suffers from BDD suffers from a distorted self perception (you could can this a “delusion”).  Many of us are convinced we’re actually horribly ugly and not delusional and our distress is proportional, this means we suffer from **poor insight**. 

Let’s make sure we don’t use terminology that doesn’t exist in how BDD is defined and treated. BDD is a complicated disorder and hard to define so let’s try to stay consistent with the terms to not make this more complicated or even misinformed.",1644570747.0

The way a groom treated me at my cousins wedding made me feel hideous. He had such disdain for me on the spot and showed it through his body language. Its interactions like these that make me want to stay home and hide my face from the public.,18,spirue,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/spirue/the_way_a_groom_treated_me_at_my_cousins_wedding/,7,"I remember i went to a wedding and my cousin keep boasting about this man she met, (She been wanted to get married badly)and saying he was great and amazing. and she begged me to go to her wedding. I sucked it up and went despite my anxiety. I go there, greet him say hello , shake hands and smile. As soon as i smiled his face fell. i panicked instantly and wanted to go the mirror right away.  I am sensitive to facial expressions, every dirty look or look of disapproval it triggers me back to my bullying days and makes me want to hide. That was not a good sign. I did have a photographer look sorta funny as well. Again i wanted to go the mirror. I  walked away quickly after that. i  checked the mirror my eyeliner was a bit smudged and hair got poofy from the humidity.

  I noticed my cousin husband was fine with everyone, smiling with other people, even if he was nervous was polite to them. With me, huge different story!!! He was uncomfortable around me and made it apparent to show me that he felt slighted around me and that i was an annoyance.  Just for being happy for my cousin get married?? by being positive and wanted to congratulate? This dude was in his late 40s and i was in my early 20s, how is someone nearly 20 years older than me thought it was okay to act this way is beyond me.


As me and my mom were leaving to go home. the groom was hugging and telling everyone 'thanks for coming' as they were leaving. He hugged my mom, he saw me, and gave me a straight up hostile look and does not say anything. I felt awkward and was like um.... the first thing that popped out was 'Nice to meet you!"" and he says in such a cold tone 'thank you' and walks away and literally turned his back to me and continues to greet and thank other guests. I couldnt help but feel slighted. I went home overthinking, thinking why he reacted so negative to me like that. I thought maybe it because he didnt know me well. But he didnt know my mom and he hugged her and was polite to her. He was fine with my other cousins he didnt know well and greeted them fine.

  I dont think i was the most offensive looking person there. Why was i the one to be left out and treated bad?.Thats what bothered me, the different treatment. His body language made it clear iI made such a negative impression and disgusted him that he had to turn his back and talk to me in a very cold manner.

 Everyone else seemed fine with me, some people said i looked so beautiful which i couldnt believe and  they were nice, and full of smiles except for that douche and that photographer sorta looking at me like a deer in the headlights. i Me having BDD, of course i always focus on the negative. A million positive things can happen to me, but there is 1 in million that is negative, my brain will focus more on that.

I had to see him again when he drove all of us when we went to another wedding, again he was cold, purposely excluded out of the photo when we are in the photo booth when i tried to pose next to my cousin but just suddenly and roughly grabbing her to take a pic, rude much?? like i was not there! that picture came out so awkward, i was just standing there to the side alone looking confused! He gave me the side eye and was visibly annoyed by my presence (heavy sighing, looking around everywhere but me looking panicked, ) i dont think i ever seen anyone so triggered and offended by my presence like  that,.  sorry i exist and that you find me so ugly, that was not my fault!

if this happened to you , would you feel ugly and hurt? doubting yourself??",1644533055.0

The fact I can't weigh myself makes me really scared,2,spulf9,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/spulf9/the_fact_i_cant_weigh_myself_makes_me_really/,0,"Trigger warning I guess? Not sure how this sub works so I don't know If trigger warnings are necessary. The place I rent doesn't have a scale and I want to buy one but I'm frugal and scales are like $30 so I don't really feel like buying one. I might cave in and buy one because I always squeeze my inner thighs together while standing up to see if they touch. If they start to touch even a little bit I get scared that I gained weight. But buying a scale and weighing myself might make it worse. Honestly, I don't know If I have BDD or an eating disorder right now because I have been clean from anorexia for like years. Ever since I lost weight in the summer though, I've been feeling really happy about being skinny. I moved out from my parents house and I sometimes I'm too busy or lazy to cook or buy food so I just naturally ate less and got skinnier. I don't try to restrict calories but I notice myself going back into my old mindset sometimes.... I also don't think I look fat but I randomly feel fat sometimes even if I haven't eaten much. I feel like since I don't eat much + I don't work out I probably have a really slow metabolism. I don't want to count calories because I know that will make me spiral into old habits but sometimes I get uncomfortable because I'm not sure if I actually eat too less or not. I am happy when I think I haven't eaten much. It also doesnt help having a roommate who eats like nothing so it makes me wonder if I actually eat too much or too little 

Also my facial asymmetry drives me crazy. I always talk about it to my boyfriend but he says no one notices it. My roommates girlfriend who I met recently called me pretty and it made me so happy because I thought she was really pretty. I feel pretty sometimes when I look in the mirror but if I really inspect my face I get super uncomfortable. I hate how asymmetrical my jaw is, how long my face is, how there's a bump on my nose, how asymmetrical my lips are, and how small my lips are too. I really think I would feel better if my nose, lips, and jaw weren't asymmetrical. Also the side of my face are like a little sunken in? I hate how my eyes are small. I hate how when I smile my nose gets so big, especially in certain lighting. Like oh my god my nose looks so ugly in certain lighting, but in other lighting it looks small and nice. I feel okay with makeup on but I still think my midface looks too big. I hate how big my face is. Even with makeup my eyes still look small. I definitely think I'm below average, even though my boyfriend thinks I'm pretty. I don't compare myself to celebrities, I mainly compare myself to people around me or strangers that are the same race as me. I feel like I have slightly masculine features honestly. I started really hating my face when peers in highschool made fun of my eyes, and also when I started to notice myself more in photos and videos. Tbh maybe like 9-12 I started hating getting my photo taken because I thought I looked bad. I had anorexia and BDD at like 13/14. I still am super uncomfortable when other people take pictures of me. I don't know if I have BDD now but I don't know where else to rant so I decided to come here.",1644568444.0

TW: ED + early onset BDD",12,spfnii,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/spfnii/i_am_sick_to_my_stomach_with_myself_they_lied_to/,12,"**PLEASE no input from anyone who feels a need to disclose that they have a curvy body type & somehow have it worse. It is a trigger for me.**

I'm so pathetic, how did I fall for it? When I was around 12 or 13 I developed anorexia after going down a rabbit hole of thousands of thinspo, pro-ana, ED glorification content online and started starving myself. It got so bad that I lost my period and had to start birth control to regulate my cycle again at 14. At the same time (and even years earlier), I was exposed to a lot of pornography and sexual beauty standards. I'm so stupid, why didn't I just listen to that?

When I was 14 I think that's when my BDD and body image issues really kicked in because I started hating myself *extremely* for making myself super skinny and it was/still feels irreversible because my natural body type is already petite. I started >!self-harming!< while comparing myself to curvy women and purposefully giving myself panic attacks about them because I felt I deserved the pain. I started excessively researching exercise routines, creams, surgeries, and pills to get big boobs and wider hips and a big butt...to no avail. Sometimes I'd get reassurance that I wasn't done growing and puberty would catch up like a flower waiting to bloom...

Well now I am 22 and I am still struggling with my weight. I am an underweight, disgusting skeleton-looking piece of garbage who could never amount to the beautiful, sexy, feminine woman that I so desperately want to be. And I cry about it every day. I have no curves, virtually no femininity, I have no sex appeal and it brings me so much anguish...

It was a lie. The whole time. Skinny was never the standard for men's general sexual tastes and preferences. That stick thin standard with thigh gaps and collarbones and ribs showing...yeah, that was created by *European women* and gay men in the fashion industry because it's the body type that best shows off clothes...it is not the desirable, ""fertile,"" vibrant feminine woman that men chase and lust after.

I want to wake up and feel good about myself, I want to feel like me. This isn’t me, it feels like I’m desperately looking for external validation for how I look and people around me know it too because I just radiate so much insecurity. So much that this is my only identity.

The only few moments of pretty privilege I felt were when I had two biscuits per day for months. But that was temporary too.

I guess I’ll never be the beautiful girl that I’ve always dreamed of. This is who I am and I hate it.

I probably shouldn’t put a picture on my resume. I really don’t know what to do, the idea of death sometimes sounds good to me. Because then I wouldn’t have to deal with these problems and I’ll be at peace.

Joining a sorority made my body dysmorphia worse.,5,soxp13,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/soxp13/joining_a_sorority_made_my_body_dysmorphia_worse/,0,"I rushed a sorority to make friends in college and network. Last spring I gained close to 30 pounds due to unhealthy eating habits and more sedentary lifestyle. Prior to this weight gain I was very thin and never worried about my body. I mean I had a ton of issues with my looks but I was thin and that’s what mattered.

 I went to the beach last summer with my sisters and we took pics. I looked absolutely awful. My face was all fat and deformed and my body was unsightly and pasty pale. My friends were all cute and thin. I cried after seeing myself. 

Ever since those photos were taken I became extremely insecure about how I looked. They really showcased how bad I look. I now constantly am comparing myself to my sorority sisters and girls I’ve met in greek life. It seems to me like all of these girls are thin and tan and blonde and gorgeous and happy.

I’ve lost quite a bit of weight but I still feel so hideous and disgusting. I’m always gonna feel fat and ugly compared to these girls. I just wear baggy clothes all the time and have made excuses to not go out because of how awful I look.

I avoid taken pictures of myself even from my family ever since when I started to feel ugly around 8 years old.Never took selfies….

The more I look into the mirror, the uglier I become.I couldn’t barely look at the mirror when I was kid as I felt terrifying.

I used to be a extremely skinny kid with funnel chest.It was my biggest insecure at that time.

Now I’m 21 and I’ve been working out for several years, gained about 55lbs but still feels skinny. I’m 5’11 ,170lbs and around 20% of body fat.

I used to workout only because I hate the way I look.Being angry and hating myself was the motivation to do it.
Only recently, I hopefully found some positive reasons to workout.

Also, feeling ugly makes me less actively.
I don’t really want to be around people.
It gets better comparing to my past self tho.

someone just compared me to an unattractive male celebrity….im a female.,61,so1xgj,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/so1xgj/someone_just_compared_me_to_an_unattractive_male/,63,"they just went out of their way to text me and say i looked like this person, and it completely shattered the self confidence i’ve been building for the past 2 days. 

the celebrity as a person is pretty cool and funny i guess, and he’s not ugly but he’s not the most attractive…what’s worse is that they’re right. i do look like him, but i didn’t need anyone to point it out. 

we have similarities mainly in the eyes. i’ve always hated my eyes because of the shape and how spaced out they are. i fckin hate myself. like this is genuinely sending me down a spiral, why would they do that to me.

then i asked the boy i’ve been talking to if he thinks i look like him and he said and i quote 
“he looks like a sloth, and you look like a sloth…so ya”
and that literally broke me because
now i feel like he’s been lying to me when he calls me attractive
plus i’m the one who even started calling myself a sloth, it’s even in my ig handle  (because i do resemble them but they are the the type of animals that are so ugly that they’re cute so i love them) 

i hate when ppl call me a sloth tho because, my way of coping is to hurt myself before anyone can hurt me  
which is why i keep a  low esteem.
so to see ppl hurt me with something i’m already hurting myself with is like beating a dead horse

now i feel horrible abt myself and prolly gonna isolate because i feel unbearable ugly",1644373140.0

Before and after postpartum,4,sofcyv,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sofcyv/before_and_after_postpartum/,0,"I’ve always had an issue with my face, body and my boobs. I had my boobs specifically tattood so I didn’t have to look at my areola/nipples. 

My family have always told me what small boobs I have, it’s a running joke for them. I know it shouldn’t affect me but it does, I used to have slightly larger boobs but I lost a bit of weight and they went with it. 

Fast forward to this week, I was feeding my 2 week old (I decided to do combined feeding) and my family have all been around. My mum decided this was a good time to tell me that my boobs looked huge compared to how small they usually are and how empty they will be afterwards. This has really affected me. 

I always said I’d have a breast lift by 30 but I’m sure I’ll be having implants in now. (This will come with comments telling me I shouldn’t have, that I always looked good)

I am beginning to dislike more and more about my body and I can’t stop but think about what it’s going to look like after. 

Ive always found it hard to understand why my partner would want me, I’m not particularly attractive or everyone’s cup of tea but I certainly don’t understand why he’d want me now. 

My face doesn’t look the same to me anymore, every time I look in the mirror I feel sick. I stupidly looked up things I shouldn’t have especially pictures of people that I wish I had similarities too. This included my partners ex’s, I understand why he wanted them. 

All this has been making me cry multiple times a day and I can’t seem to stop. I want to make myself perfect for my partner and everyone so they have nothing to say. 

I find that not being able to be intimate with my partner for minimum of 6 weeks really hard because it’s like what else do I have going for me at the moment? 

I always knew having a baby would be hard on the already warped view I have of myself but I didn’t know how much, I was hoping I’d look in the mirror and think it was all a miracle and how wonderful I look for having such a great thing but I don’t. I wouldn’t change having him for the world because he’s perfect but I just wish there was more out there to help you.

I thought maybe it's just because these women are built different but I started seeing women showing their bodies in clothes and giving measurements (thanks tiktok/fashion sub)and those measurements are bigger/same and to my eye they look bigger than me

Than I saw a picture of myself in a bathing suit and I thought...I don't look that way do I? You know the saying ""the camera adds on 10 pounds"" but pictures of me I see and than mirror look different

The amount of people I see on tiktok casually filming other people and even commenting on how they look makes me despair.

Or like someone is ordering food minding their own business and then someone decides to do something quirky in the queue and you’re now inadvertently part of the spectacle, with thousands of people online analysing your facial expression to see your reaction. Or god forbid, you’re just doing your work behind the counter and some unfunny teen films your reaction to a ‘prank.’

Jesus. I can’t stand this. It’s bad enough going outside and ‘being visible’, now I have to worry about whether someone is secretly filming me or how I might inadvertently be part of some viral tiktok. I’ve avoided cameras for years, now it increasingly feels like I can’t escape from them. I know the likelihood of being in a viral video is low, but there is definitely an increase in people filming others and uploading online.

My BDD went away because I was pretty. It’s back now.,2,snpnis,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/snpnis/my_bdd_went_away_because_i_was_pretty_its_back_now/,4,"So I have had BDD ever since I can remember myself. Growing up I had many body obsessions. First I hated my skin, then my nose, then my cheeks, my ass, my thighs (I come from a culture where being curvy isn’t attractive), my stomach, my hips. Once I came out on the other side of puberty, I’ve grown into my features and started looking conventionally attractive. A few month ago though, I found out what my side profile looks like (classic trigger) and have spiralled into a pit of BDD again. It is easier for me to mitigate my BDD symptoms than it used to be when I was a kid/early teen because I feel like I still look nice overall, even though I feel broken because of my profile. My overbite makes my moderately-sized lower jaw look small. My BDD is both better and worse than it used to be. I had episodes of suicidal ideation because of BDD spirals this year, but I also learned to live with it and take care of myself much better than I used to (maybe it’s because I feel prettier than I did before finishing puberty). 

As a result of my BDD coming back, I realised that becoming attractive is a bandaid solution. It is much easier to live with BDD if you know you're conventionally attractive, but that won't stop you from still being insecure and feeling like your only value is your appearance. Additionally, your looks are not forever. If you’re around 20 and want to “cure” BDD through plastic surgery, that will only last you 20 or so years (and you will likely still be dissatisfied with the surgery results). As you age, your BDD will come back and progressively get more mentally taxing. I know it’s easier to be pretty. I watch tik toks from gorgeous girls talking about BDD, and I deeply envy them because they most likely have beautiful profiles. Ultimately though, BDD is not only about compulsion but also about self-worth. “Becoming pretty” will not give you self-worth. When I was 15 and for the first time my reflection in the mirror looked beautiful, I started crying because I realised I was still an empty shell of a human being with no self-esteem. I think what I want rn is not so much realising that my profile looks fine (everyone keeps telling me that, but it doesn't help) but telling my thoughts, “yea, you’re right, I am ugly, but it doesn’t matter”. I know so many (conventionally) “ugly” people who are confident, happy and have very attractive personalities. I am attracted to both genders and throughout my dating history I never paid much mind to how the person looks, unless they are hot which would just be a plus and not a necessity for me (like being rich or something). I wish I treated myself the same. I want to forget about my face and what it says about me. I want to be away from compulsively trying to better my appearance. Let's say I’m “ugly”, I just really want to be normal mentally, not physically. Normal like the majority of people who aren't the standard of beauty but lead happy, healthy lives unlike me.",1644341244.0

This sub is so incredibly poorly run and whoever moderates knows exactly what’s going on but chooses to ignore it. How is this a welcoming sub to Trans people when someone can just casually post something so transphobic. How is it welcoming to POC’s, specifically young ones, when a lot of the posts and comments talk about how ugly being a POC is. How is “i hate other pretty girls” rhetoric so freaking normalized here? Oh but no mean language, right.


And for the people that keep posting these awful, toxic comments. Your mental health is not an excuse to be a horrible person. Stop spreading hateful, disgusting rhetoric because u refuse to have some accountability. This isn’t a “support” sub, this is a place where people go and just unleash all their toxicity and hate, and I feel like it should be titled as such.


Update: Please report the toxicity out. Bring it to the moderators attention and don’t just ignore it and scroll. Thats the only way we could make this sub a bit less toxic.

I'm at a healthy 25 BMI now since shedding the covid 15, but of course my motto is ""you can never be too rich or too thin"". I eat healthy though, so I'm not too worried about extreme weight issues. I'm willing to put my health before my obsession when it comes to diet.

Now I'm on a facial skin care kick. I'm kinda obsessed with Retin-A and stacking moisturizers. Watching the progress is kinda fascinating, my new routine has made a noticeable impact on acne and skin texture. I stare way too much at my face now though, hard to look away.

I guess, when is it BDD, or just wanting to make the most of the body I have? I took a quick glance at the survey in the wiki, and I certainly identify with most of the traits in the OCD umbrella, so maybe BDD is another one?

things like being a former fat kid, bullying, ugly duckling syndrome, abuse, everchanging beauty standards, and more can all factor into a conventional person developing bdd. i personally was an ugly duckling, and still struggle coming to terms with how people seem to perceive me now. its overwhelming, i feel like a long con prank is being pulled on me, and im waiting for the day that people drop the act and tell me how they really see me, the way i see me.

i should be able to say that without a million caveats, on how i know unconventional people objectively have it worse in some ways, but being conventional comes with its own set of problems. we all deal with this illness differently, and none of us will heal as long as we participate in this invalidation war. that goes for unconventional and conventional looking people.",1644204142.0

My face is abnormally wide, I have a deformed potatoe face, my eyes are really small which makes my face look even wider and just completely unproportional. I had a big ass crooked nose which got fixed with surgery. Honestly my parents who financed that could have spared that money because I still look like shit. My body is ugly as well. I have no bum or tits. I have weird looking thin chickenlegs, no hips and broad shoulders. I'm honestly so surprised that people recognize I'm a woman..... 

My mother who looks like me thinks she's pretty. Tbh I would even call her quite arrogant because she brings other women down to make herself look better. She doesn't say that to their faces, she is very nice to other people but she always tells me how much better she looks compared to others her age. She also says I look like her and brings my friends or cousins down when comparing me to them.  I guess deep down she might be insecure and bringing others down is her way to make herself feel better. Or maybe she genuinely thinks she's the prettiest woman and I'm the prettiest daughter ever but Idk how someone could be this delusional..

I also feel anger towards my father for deciding to mate with her. But what really pisses me off the most is their audacity to ask me when I'm going to start dating. Like in what world do I stand a chance with anyone???? I just can't believe how delusional they are... It triggers me way more when people tell me I'm pretty than when they tell me I'm ugly. (Btw the only people to call me pretty are my parents and an uncle.)
Anyways I feel like I'm the only one with Bdd to be so incredibly angry at their parents even tho besides deciding to have children they aren't bad people. Sometimes I feel bad for them because I'm so emotionally unavailable and I don't give them any type of love. But I just can't help it. My mirror tells me I have every right to be mad.",1644183150.0
I think I've figured out the root of my bdd...advice needed,12,sm6diw,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sm6diw/i_think_ive_figured_out_the_root_of_my_bddadvice/,1,"So I think I've got it.

I'm Yemeni and when I was younger I looked like a mixed girl and I was praised for my looks a lot (I think wanting to be the prettiest in the room stems from my childhood) but somewhere when I hit puberty I got darker and started to look more Somali. I remember being called 'dhuxul' which means charcoal in Somali. 

In my family, lighter skin is seen as more attractive and looking (East) African is seen as an ugly trait. I am constantly compared to my sisters; they both look very Arab. They are also one or two shades lighter. It's really had an impact on our relationship as sisters. I don't like being around them. I always feel less worthy, less attractive. I feel like they also have a better bond and I always feel left out. 

I don't think I can ever accept or overcome this, but does anyone have any advice on how to cope? How can I not be triggered so much or how can I feel better when I do get triggered?",1644178680.0

I saw a post on here earlier talking about how BDD sufferers who are  unattractive have it harder. While I understand where that person is coming from (you’re more likely to be mistreated by outsiders/strangers if you’re outer appearance is considered unattractive), I think self-perception is important.

Over the years I’ve read lots of articles in the news about conventionally attractive people committing suicide due to BDD. The most recent article I read was about a 20 year old man who committed suicide because he couldn’t deal with blemishes on his skin. I saw his pictures and his family confirmed that he had beautiful skin; however, he would spend hours staring at his skin in the mirror, analysing any bumps or discolouration.",1644149203.0

I don't understand why I keep gaining weight,8,sluwp0,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sluwp0/i_dont_understand_why_i_keep_gaining_weight/,5,"I don't know what to do. I've been unhappy with my body ever since I can remember and then I lost weight and still wasn't happy but now all the weight is coming back and I don't know why.

I'm currently 24F and I had an eating disorder from age 13 to 18. I don't want to go back there but I'm struggling a lot right now mentally with it.

When I was at my heaviest, I wad 93.5kg. I had a life style change (moving out from home), I became better with my eating habits, I started working out more often and went down to 73kg within 6 months.

I went back home and gained 5kg back within like 2 months. I told myself it's not a big deal and I'd be fine as long as I stay below 80kg. Time passes, and by the time I'm 23, I'm around 85kg. So basically I gained the weight back within 5 years. I guess COVID also happened, which made moving about more difficult. I moved my own goal posts and said it's okay as long as I stay below 90kg. 

But now another year has passed and I'm currently at 92kg and I don't know what to do. I work out twice a week (3-4x if it fits into my schedule) and I have an average of 4500 steps a day. Could be better but I do have an office job where I just... have to sit at my desk from 9am to 6pm. I have fruit with almost every meal, vegetables in every meal and also a salad as a side for most meals. I don't eat meat or fish. I do snack, I love crisps, but I also ate snacks when I was at my lowest weight.

I know I'm getting older but surely I'm not that old to be gaining 7kg within a year despite no changes in diet or life style?

I want to lose weight but I'm scared if I focus a lot on my diet again, I'll fall back into my eating disorder. I just hate the way I look with or without clothes, I hate looking at my stomach and my face.

I feel like I won't ever be happy, I wasn't even happy when I was at my lowest, but I accepted myself more then than I do now and I just want some of that self acceptance back.",1644148220.0
briefly figured out what normal feels like,12,sls90l,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sls90l/briefly_figured_out_what_normal_feels_like/,2,"I have no one to share this HUGE step, aside from this subreddit so..

I've had an insane building anxiety about my face for years now, and the pandemic happened just as my BDD suddenly worsened. This was the best thing in the world, as everyone had to wear face masks and the world got locked down.

Immediately, I only attended classes online, and used every single excuse to avoid seeing friends, and if they convinced me, I would keep my facemask on 24/7. I just pretended I had immuno-compromised family living with me. I'd rather die than for people to know I have BDD, as I used to be known as a total social butterfly. But I wanted to take it further, to not have have see anyone at all. 

So I decided to take time off college, I temporarily moved across the Atlantic Ocean to Central America to avoid social contact even further as aside from my family, I knew no one there. I've been a hermit for the past year, I only leave the house I'm lodging at for irregular doctors appointments, and my face mask stays on.

Anyway, my dad and my kid sister (who both already lived over here) finally convinced me to go meet them at the Cinta Costera (or the Causeway in English), which is this long road going straight across the middle of a body of water. On the left, you see the city skyline and beyond that, the Atlantic. On the otherside, across the water lies the mountains and jungle.

So, sunset comes, and my dad suddenly wants a pic, I'm about to refuse because DUH PICTURES EW, plus it's fairly busy so no way am I letting so many people see my uncovered face, when something inside of me just tells me to go for it.

I swear I'd forgotten what it was like to show my whole face in public, it's been well over a year, and for a minute, I didn't care at all about what I looked like. Or if anyone was looking at me. 

It was warm, even the breeze was warm, the sunset was covering the entire sky. And I felt so free FFS. I can't explain how good and calm I felt. I put my mask back on after a minute, and soon the anxiety comes rushing back, but I can't get that feeling out of my memory. It was utter UTTER bliss.

i'll get right to the point and say i hate my chest. it's not as flat as it was when i was 18 but it still is unnoticeable unless i'm naked, and even then, the fact my stomach sticks out the same amount as my boobs and the fact that i have a wide torso/rib cage makes me look even worse than with clothes on. the size is what bothers me the most to the point where i have wanted to self harm on my breasts because at least the first thing any potential gf will notice is the scars, not how deformed and blobby i look. it'd be fine if i had actual curves to balance it out. it's gotten to the point where even nsfw art makes me feel sick because i immediately start feeling underdeveloped and gross. i don't even have a pretty face or wide hips or anything to 'make up' for it. i've never thought this way about anyone else but when it's me i just feel like i'm horrifically deformed. i barely find the energy to get out of bed and take care of myself because what's the point? i'm ugly anyway, why try to hide it? i'll shower and then just go back to sleep. i'm almost 21, every girl i've ever dated has cheated on me and each time it had something to do with me being sexually unappealing. i'm too broke to afford plastic surgery. i just wish i didn't have this body.

I’ve been feeling so well these past couple of weeks especially since I’ve started seeing someone (long distance of course), I do have the nerves for when he sees me, I always will honestly, but I’ve been feeling a lot better because he’s always keeping me distracted and makes me feel confident actually. I hate when I’m just by myself and just watching a YouTube video or scrolling on Instagram (I really tailor my feed to block out anything but animal stuff and some memes) and something comes up about a body, whether it’s a tik tok girl, an insult comedy post made about girls with no boobs/ass, or just a picture of a beautiful woman, I automatically get flooded again with the feeling of how ugly I am. I get so nervous my boyfriend will see my body in real life and realize how bad I look, whenever we send sexy pictures I have to make sure I angle the camera a certain way so I don’t catch too much of the rest of my body, even though he is incredibly incredibly flattering and sweet about my entire body.

I haven’t felt real disgust with my body in the past weeks so it sucks to have the feelings come up again, and when I revisit this subreddit I’m reminded of how many people still struggle with this everyday and it just makes me sad. I hate calling my body and face ugly but it’s what I’ve come to believe, so when my bf compliments me, I can’t help but just not believe it. Even with all of this I know it’s really important I always accept compliments very graciously from him, especially since constantly putting myself down and denying compliments was a major factor in the end of my previous relationship. Moving forward, I do think my confidence will only get better, but I know that’s on me to fix and not my partners, but he sure as hell helps. Okay just needed to vent haha. 🤍",1644095767.0

My (26f) boyfriend (28m) struggles with extreme BDD,3,sl2qj7,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sl2qj7/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_struggles_with_extreme_bdd/,11,"For context, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now which means we began dating during the pandemic. We gradually kept hanging out more and eventually I moved in with him over an hour away from my family about 8 months into our relationship. 
In the beginning, our relationship felt very uplifting and positive despite what was going on in the world. We were being very intimate and didn’t really argue much. He is a very loving and sweet person and I consider myself lucky to have found him in the shitstorm of current dating culture.
7 months ago he quit left his job on a mutual termination agreement and has been struggling to find remote work (I am severely immunocompromised so he’s agreed to stay as safe as possible for now) and I know it’s taken a toll on him. I have helped him clean up his resume, look for jobs and I want him to find something so he can finally feel self sufficient again.
I noticed his body dysmorphia a few months into us dating when it felt like my compliments didn’t hold as much weight as they did at first. It went from a lighthearted brush off like “oh you’re just saying that” to straight up not believing me anymore and I’ve grown resentful. 
I put so much effort into our relationship, I’ve encouraged him to get help numerous times, I’ve given him extra compliments but it feels like him and I are stuck in a toxic cycle of me feeling less vulnerable around him and him feeling guilty for the way he feels. 
I know post this may come off selfish but I don’t have anywhere else to express my selfish thoughts, I try to hide it from him. That being said, I just don’t know how to feel like my words actually mean anything anymore and it makes me feel less compelled to compliment him and I know that’s contributing to his insecurities. I feel guilt for not wanting to answer his 14 questions about his body a day. It feels emotionally exhausting and I want to give him reassurance when I feel like it naturally (which is often.) 
Anytime I have expressed my feelings about this to him he spirals mentally and feels immense guilt so it doesn’t even feel worth talking about anymore. I just want to feel like this relationship doesn’t revolve around his obsessions. I can’t force him to seek help but I’m also suffering the consequences of that. 
I go to therapy weekly and my therapist keeps telling me he needs help and I so badly want it for him. He deserves to feel better and he’s a great person. 
What would you do in this situation / how would you feel? Is this normal in relationships where one is struggling with BDD?

Antidepressants almost immediately stopped thoughts/worries about my appearance,6,sk5yxx,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sk5yxx/antidepressants_almost_immediately_stopped/,2,"I do not have clinical BDD, so take everything with a grain of salt. I thought I would just share my experience so that others might know that there are options out there.

For the last few years, I've been worried about my appearance (especially my face). It would come in waves. Some days, I didn't think about it too much, just put on the normal makeup and went out the door. Other days, I would leave public places early because I felt like people shouldn't have to see my face. I was obsessed with glowing up and constantly watched videos and read about it.

In was in a bad wave when I went on antidepressants. I started for completely different reasons. But, on the second day, I noticed that the bad wave was over. If you don't know, antidepressants normally take 2 weeks for effects to start to show, so I thought it was placebo. But in the 4-5 months I was on antidepressants (duloxetine then fluoxetine), I was barely worried about my appearance. I would actually go to school without eye makeup on, which is insane for me. I didn't watch all of the TikTok glow-up compilations (again) on Youtube or visit r/amiugly everyday. It didn't even occur to me.

But antidepressants (specifically SSRIs and SNRIs) didn't work for me for the reasons I started. Turns out I have a rare gene(?) that makes antidepressants make me more depressed and very (TW) >!suicidal!<. The only upside in taking them for me was just the improvement in body image. So I stopped at the end of December and haven't been on them since. 

Within a week or two of stopping, I became worried about my appearance again. I honestly forgot that it was something I used to think about, so it was very weird to have it pop up in my mind. Now, I'm back to my old habits, only I'm in a very bad wave. I keep watching videos of people glowing up and trying to analyze all of the ways in which their face changed that made them better (and how I could replicate it on myself), I go on r/amiugly everyday and even posted there (on a separate account), I got Faceapp and started editing me to look better than taking notes on how I could achieve this in real life. The semester started and I'm constantly thinking about how I look, especially when we're in groups for assignments. 

Anyway, all of this to say, please talk to someone about possibly starting antidepressants if you're struggling. It could really help! Also, if you're worried, I didn't gain any weight on them, so remember that that only happens to a percentage of the people.",1643954665.0
Idk,7,sk5l00,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sk5l00/idk/,3,"I just want to feel beautiful. No models seem to look like me. I have a large protruding nose, small lips, fat accumulating under my chin. Boxy torso. Small butt People tell me I look pretty, but I don’t see it. I just want to love myself so badly. The way that someone can just look at someone else and become curious and obsessed with them just from their appearance… I want that to be me. I want to see what other people tell me they see. 

I want to be a waif. I want to look ghostly and elven and dainty. I want to look like I could snap. Have dainty flat facial features. With symmetry. 

Sometimes if I’m in an illusion I think I could look like her. I see her. And then I look from a different lens and I’m deformed and morphed and fat and a lard. I saw a picture tonight where I looked so unlike what I thought I did, that I wanted to scream. Disgusting creature. I don’t even feel like I look human in how gross sometimes I look. 

I want to love myself. And I don’t. It’s so embarrassing having to keep all this self hatred to myself. I cry when I feel close to my boyfriend because I don’t understand how he finds me attractive physically or how he thinks I deserve him. I feel so lonely in this struggle.

Doctor laughed when I said I was too ugly to have friends,18,sjqfw9,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sjqfw9/doctor_laughed_when_i_said_i_was_too_ugly_to_have/,0,"I’m honestly so distraught about my appearance recently. Every second of the day I’m thinking about it. It’s even becoming difficult to be seen in public with a mask, because it doesn’t cover enough of my appearance. I’m an ogre. I’ve never ever seen someone even close as to how ugly I am. I spend all day researching how to fix these problems but it just makes me even more distressed. I have severe jowls and a massive double chin, a dad bod and moobs but I’m an 18 year old female. My jaw is really wonky and my nose twists to the opposite side, emphasising it more. I have small eyes and uneven lips that are also incredibly small, they also go the opposite way to my nose. My mouth itself is tiny, which looks ridiculous on my massive head. I basically have a lollipop head, but my body is massive and broad, so my head is actually really big considering how broad I am. My head shape is like an upside down pentagon. I have a cowlick at the front of my hairline making my middle parting look really uneaten as one half is sticking up in an arch. I’ve tried other hair partings but it emphasises my wonky jowls.  And I hate my haircut, it’s so unflattering and short. It’s supposed to hide my wonky temples but it just looks like someone shat down either side of my head. I’m already so much of a failure in life, why couldn’t I just look mediocre instead of disgusting? Anyway, I had to go to the doctors because I stuck a knitting needle through my thigh, and it only went through the fat but that made me feel humiliated because now I’m thinking about how fat my thighs are again. She asked about my support system and that’s when it happened. The average person doesn’t know what it’s like to be too ugly to socialise.

Cried in a shopping mall..my body is genuinely messed up though,9,sjhli4,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sjhli4/cried_in_a_shopping_mallmy_body_is_genuinely/,2,"So..every once in a blue moon I decide that getting outside of my house and do something nice for myself would be a good idea.
It hasn’t been so far.
Two days ago I went shopping because as it happens with someone who has a fd up body shape..I realized most of my clothes looked bad on me.
I am very very small built for a 20 year old woman, with even 13 year old girls having wider hips and shoulders (measured in inches) than I do. Puberty did almost nothing for me.. 

If I go on a website and put in my measurements to help me find my size, even the smallest xs are often described as being too big
Stores like Zara are a no no, same as Stradivarius for example

I spent hours in the store, went through at least 4 of them only to find myself almost crying the the changing room and actually doing it on the way out and on my way home..
NO, this isn’t just my Body dysmorphia talking, I am and was genuinely too small for most of these clothes, shirts were either too wide at the shoulders or big in general or too revealing because I had to go for a smaller size..
Pants I won’t even talk about because at this point I am used to buying them at the kids section and even those are often ill-fitting and some too wide for my hips.

Jackets look ridiculously big and shoes that are my size make my already big feet look like I’m a duck because of my skinny legs.
I often wear shoes smaller that hurt my toes because most shoes in my size are too wide for me.

All I kept doing, as I always do was 
1.Walking through the stores staring at all the beautiful clothes thinking : Oh that’s nice, can’t wear it though…or that would look awful on me
2.Trying on plenty of stuff and it always being too big

I don’t feel like a woman and coming from a family of tall, busty and strong looking women, thinking I would end up like that too and ending up not to..makes me so miserable and there’s no way I could ever accept myself",1643890075.0

I have a job where I have to put my hair back and I kind of have a crush on one of my coworkers, he said the same thing and now I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m anxious about going into work because I can’t think of a hairstyle that would be allowed and make me comfortable.",1643889456.0
Even if I were pretty,4,sjh257,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sjh257/even_if_i_were_pretty/,1,"Looking back on old childhood photos of mine, when I liked the way I looked and was radiant from swimming all the time, I feel like I have decent facial harmony. Regardless, even if my actual features haven’t changed since then (except for some uneven jaw growth), I still look like a completely different person.

My skin is super dull and I get told a lot that I look tired. I’ve been battling depression and OCD since I was a kid, so I guess that would end up showing externally in some shape or form. I have extremely bad posture, I haven’t exercised regularly in over a decade despite only being 19, I’m just a mess, even if I am picking the pieces back up.

I guess my point is that even if I do have quote unquote pretty features or was genetically blessed, it barely even matters with this self-prophetic condition. I think I’m ugly, I think that that is something that makes me unlovable, I think that I’m worthless, so slowly, slowly, that’s what I turn myself into. Through not having the energy to take care of myself, through self-hating crying spells, through staying in bed playing games for weeks on end, I become uglier and uglier, and more withdrawn, until all the beauty that I’ve ever been blessed with gradually slips away from me and I just become the forgotten one. The ugly one. The unlovable one.",1643888247.0

Really, one day ill be happy. Im not even sad anymore just lost at whats my next step. What i want for my life is not something i personally could obtain.

Side Profile [Relapse],18,sj0gx7,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sj0gx7/side_profile_relapse/,12,"I was doing really well for a while. Every day I woke up it seemed like I just felt better and better about myself! Like my BDD had just completely gone away. My self-confidence was at an all time high, I felt really pretty and I felt like people were treating me better. I felt like maybe others could look at me and think I was pretty too.

But then I remembered about my nose. And my big cheeks, and the fat under my chin. Now I'm relapsing. And I don't know what to do. I feel absolutely disgusting, and as if no one could possibly look at me and think I'm pretty. I feel humiliated, and like the guy I like must think I'm disgusting every time he sees my side profile. So I try not to let him see it, always facing forward. But I seriously don't believe that he could find me attractive. Who would, after seeing how much of a monster I am? I feel awful right now.

And don't get me wrong, I think I'm pretty from the front. At least moderately pretty. But from the side, maybe I'm a 3/10. I feel really gross and depressed, and I don't know what to do. I don't think anyone could ever love me or pick me over other women when other women have cute little button noses, and skinny faces, and just beautiful side profiles.

i can't even take selfies anymore unless i hide my lower half of my face and cover the chin fully, its gotten that extreme. and if i do see other women with this kind of face it's usually smaller so looks more ""normal"" and ugly like mine. never heard anyone consider it pretty or cute at all either

Severe BDD - nothings working,3,sj1jbh,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sj1jbh/severe_bdd_nothings_working/,8,"Sorry this is a long one 😂

For exactly a year I have been plunged into a severe bout of what doctors have labelled body dysmorphia. My primary concerns are the size and shape of my face/head, and the shape of my legs. Unfortunately it’s not just limited to these aspects but virtually all body parts. I hate the way I walk, move, blink and speak. It all looks wrong/awkward to me. The worst part is that while these flaws may be exaggerated in my mind, they are also very real (backed up by data) which means that no amount of therapy or drugs can ever ‘cure’ them. I’ve tried multiple therapist&psychiatrist, drugs (ssri’s and antipsychotics , hypnotherapy and a stay in a psychiatric hospital. 

I am now functioning again (back at work and getting on with life) and the obsessional checking behaviours are no longer present. But I still can’t bare to look in a mirror, I still hate the way I look, and I still have no hope in ever feeling truly happy or free. I’m sick to death of reading recovery advice around keeping busy or focussing more on who I am rather than how I look. It doesn’t work, it just means I’m distracted and avoiding thinking about my life and future. If this is the best that life can be for me I don’t know how much longer I’ll survive.

I’m sorry about how depressing this was but I hope it makes someone feel less alone. 


Ps.  I have a great support network around me and access to some of the best bdd consultants in the world. If you too are struggling please get help as many people do recover.

Thankfully I have a supportive partner who stroked my hair after I quieted down until I was able to fall asleep for a half hour. I covered up the mirrors. I don’t know if this goes into eating disorder territory but I felt the urge to binge. 

If I tell my therapist nothing will be done and there aren’t many resources where I live. I feel like what I am doing is very traumatising to my partner and he shouldn’t have to live with it. I know I need to change my relationship with food and my appearance. Nothing ever seems to make sense to me. I don’t understand the notion of being more important than how physically attractive I am. I don’t understand how I am deserving of love just for being me. All of that, accepting myself for who I am, feels like defeat. If I just keep trying I’ll be a version of myself worth loving one day. That’s just really hard to achieve when so much of my energy goes towards not killing myself.

i don’t have anyone that understands why i wouldn’t want to go. and i do want to go. just maybe not to this beach. maybe not with my sister who literally is perfect and wears string bikinis. add in the fact that i’m pale and just not comfortable being in a small bikini. i’m jealous i’m insecure. i just don’t want to go but there’s no way i can say i don’t want to go on this free vacation to my family.

i don’t want to be jealous of her bc i love her and she deserves these things, but i’m just so insecure right now. i’ve had 3 guys in the past get with her after being with me. it deff just makes me feel like my husband is going to want her lol or at least think ab her. i obviously can’t bring this up bc everyone’s gonna talk ab how insecure and rude it is to say that. i just don’t know. i just don’t want to go lol.",1643809171.0

How do I get over my body dysmorphia when I'm actually unattractive and it's not just in mind?,26,si8ogc,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/si8ogc/how_do_i_get_over_my_body_dysmorphia_when_im/,17,"Post inspired by the therapy session I had today.

My therapist kept trying to convince me that my physical appearance isn't my issue and my perception of myself is warped. (Also she has never seen me without a mask on... But its not like she could just tell me I'm ugly anyways )

The fact is that... My real life experience greatly contradicts this. Ever since I was young I've heard people talk badly about the physical features that I have: ""Big noses on women are unattractive"", ""frizzy hair looks so unkempt"", ""moles look like someone shat on their face"", ""nobody would ever like a girl so skinny with no curves""...

And I've had people actually insult me to my face. Throw paper pieces at me saying that they mistook me for the trash. I've been asked out as a joke.

And when people aren't being mean about my physical appearance I just get ignored. If I go out with friends they'll end up having guys flirting with them while I stand there awkwardly. If I have a crush there's a good chance they'll end up liking my pretty friend instead. When I enter a room nobody says hi to me but they say hi to my pretty friend.

Am I supposed to believe that my perception is actually warped? All my life it's been made clear as day that I'm ugly. And now I'm being told that I'm just being exaggerated. I'm not really sure on what to with my life.

Can I even get over BDD if I'm actually ugly? It's like every time I leave my house, my worst anxieties are confirmed.",1643757258.0

 I often fantasize about becoming like them and treating them the same way we were treated. Or that they are taken to some place where no one cares what they look like and need to survive on personality alone.
Unfortunately, because of their luck they probably would do better even in such a society because their personalities are also developed better. A place centered around empathy and respect for the less fortunate is probably the only society in which they wouldn’t succeed. I’d love to see them struggle in it.

I'm having trouble rationalizing that the clothes I wore when I was younger are not supposed to fit my body or my actual style anymore. I don't think this in particular is a side effect from BD, just my hoarding instincts.

What I dread the most is trying on new clothes. Realizing I'm not my previous size anymore, having to measure myself to order a new set of pants because mine are too worn out or just dont fit me. Learning about sizing again. 

Coming to terms with the fact that I own a whole lot of clothes that don't fit me and will never fit me again, and that it's okay.

I have panic attacks whenever I have to go into public, and it’s not like a mask can cover it up either. You can still tell it’s big.

Nor have I taken any photos of myself while on vacation. I’ve missed so many opportunities to have memories of important milestones in my life, all because I can’t be in a photo.


It feels like it gets harder everyday and it’s getting to the point I’d rather not exist than live with this nose.",1643718417.0

My cousin is pushing me to lose weight and I don’t know how to feel,3,shozhf,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/shozhf/my_cousin_is_pushing_me_to_lose_weight_and_i_dont/,2,"I (F21) have struggled with body image all my life. At a young age, I’ve been always on the chubbier side and that had aroused notions from family members constantly telling me that “you’d be a lot prettier if you lost weight” or “look at your cousins, they’re all skinny so why aren’t you?”. It got so bad that during high school I ended up only eating crackers and water, exercising at least 2+ hours a day with 3 cups of diet tea to top it all off for months. Even with my efforts, I was subjected into ridicule with the left over little belly fat I had that I cried at my family members that I was doing the best that I could and I just wanted to be happy. Needless to say, that was the last time any family members had mentioned my weight until now. 

Fast forward to this week, my cousin had came to visit us from LA and I decided to drive her around the city while my mom was at work. During the drive, she was constantly talking about the weather in LA, her work, studies, and went into depth about her gym/fitness lifestyle. She went strangely into specific details of her fitness lifestyle, detailing exercises that I could possibly do and so on. She even went so far as to eye me up and down while I was driving and told me that “you would be really pretty if you lost a lot of weight you know?”. This triggered me, and I felt uncomfortable as it sprung on so many bad memories when it came to my body but I tried to persevere until we had gotten home. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask on here is what do I do? I don’t wanna seem like I’m being overly sensitive (my cousin didn’t know what happened between me and my other family members). But I also don’t wanna relive my trauma regarding my body with constant reminders from her saying “It’s pretty to be skinny”(she really said this to me). Advice?",1643699828.0
Anybody a parent?,1,shukvr,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/shukvr/anybody_a_parent/,4,"I really want a baby and I feel that I am at that stage in life. Some of the time I feel very capable and excited about it and then BDD crops up and I panic about how I'm going to be able to deal with it. 

For starters I look far too young and and not what a mum should be. I worry that I will look ridiculous or like the kids 'big sister'. I feel like I will be doing my child a dis-service for not looking like a parent should. I picture myself picking up at the school gate and the image of myself in my head is just awful.

I worry that I won't be confident or outgoing enough and set a bad example. 

And then I worry about all the added responsibility. All the places you need to take a child, just as a necessity (doctors, dentist etc) and then also to make it's like fulfilling. Again a part of me feels if I focus on the child and my role as mum I will be able to do this but I panic that I won't (even though I know I'll have to) I worry I'll not be able to enjoy outings and this being obvious to the kid. I worry about what happens when I'm in a depressive state. I worry about being a failure.

I guess I just want to know if anyone here has a child and how they find it. I'm best in a routine so I believe most of the time I will be fine. But those lows really concern me and that the parent image I've always had in my head won't be possible. 

I just want more than anything to be that pretty smiley happy feminine mother that I can picture in my mind. I've wanted children since as long as I can remember but I feel like my face is going to ruin it, like it ruins everything.",1643720980.0

The once life in me has been sucked out by external factors causing me pain. I just want to say you're not alone,  but stress isn't going to make it better, it'll actually age you and make it worse. There's a link between stress and biological aging of the cells, it shows in your face. As we get older, I will say, these feelings of self hatred are going to get worse once that biological clock starts clicking and dying takes toll.. I recommend as advice is to get filler, in cheeks especially but lips if you feel it's aging you, and as for my smile, I've struggled with EDS, and GERD  my teenage life and its ruined my teeth and my face.  I also have severe acne. All of these things can make us feel awful. Please don't throw your whole self away, sometimes I want to end it but , I'm saving up money so I can fix my exterior a little bit because I know my suffering, interior and emotions  has had a link in my appearance.  I wish I could go back to 10 year old me and warn myself of how much people would kill me little by little, I recommend yall do that, invest in your skin and hit up snap on veneers! They will also help your overall appearance and increase your confidence.  I think being ""ugly"" ,  plus aging is a deadly combination,  so it's important we address what  WE clearly see doesn't mean it's all overboard, there are very real medical reasons and concerns.. I also recommend you get a non reversing  mirror, it'll help you see what you look like without the flip, I've found that's changed my perspective and I hated it at first as I got used to my asymmetry, but now my mirror me feels fake, a lie and trick of the eyes. Please don't end your lives and please try to invest in yourself, forget what anyone thinks, at the end of the day, you live with you,  look into noninvasive treatments and I will pray for you. I do believe there is a heaven, because why can something so beautiful be thrown acid on (methaphorically) and it ruin its potential and fulfillment, as dying is inevitable so, if it's really stressing you out and killing you, get away from it, take a moment to think of solutions and aiding it and do what you can to heal your soul.

I just recently withing the last year learned that that this existed and oh hey it applies to me... As I kid I was very, very skinny because I was sick and couldn't eat a lot... I then underwent a surgery to fix the issue and that resulted in me being actually able to eat normally for the first time in my life. After that no one really watched what I ate or taught me how to eat because they just wanted me to gain weight... This didn't become a problem until I started to become overweight... There was a period of time where I remember I couldn't look in mirrors without feeling upset. And forget clothes shopping... I vividly remember sobbing in the fitting room as we tried to buy pairs of jean pants for school. It was all in all not a good time... I tried every diet I could and exercised the hardest I could out of everyone else... trying my best to lose my bulk... Eventually in college I just became depressed enough where I was like... screw it this is me I better learn to love me as I am cause this is it... Honestly that worked for a long while until recently. Withing the last 2 years I began seeing a doctor for help fixing some hormonal issues that I've been granted genetically... and because I've been sick still for a long time he decided to have me take Victoza. Which is great because for the first time since I could remember... I was able to lose weight in any capacity becides when I would get too sick or depressed to even eat... But... this is where my issues started up again... I've lost a significant amount of weight in the last 4 months... so much so that I've gone down many pants sizes... but while this is great... the issue still remains... now going from my old size to this one... It feels just like before with me gaining weight. Except that now when I look at mirrors... I'm confused as to where my bulk all went... I often have moments where I either realize that the fat is gone or have times where my brain is like... holy heck where is my fat?!? It honestly causes me soo much stress and really brings down my mood... it's even gotten to the point where I have to convince myself that I'm still fat in order for my brain to calm down... and that's been getting harder and harder as time goes by... The worse thing is that I though that I knew what triggered it and I've been trying to desensitize myself to it... but now I'm not even sure what triggers them anymore... I just had an incident where I just put my hands on my waist like I usually do and it triggered it. I'm just upset, confused, and done with all of this... I'll take any advice on how to help if anyone is willing to offer any.",1643656246.0

My reflection is so foreign to me.,8,sgm5ap,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sgm5ap/my_reflection_is_so_foreign_to_me/,2,"I deleted social media’s that I frequented which were Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok because they were making my body dysmorphia act up badly.

And now that I’ve lost weight people say I’m pretty or they think I’m attractive. Even my ex boyfriend didn’t understand why I didn’t see myself as pretty. But when I looked in that reflection I look so weird. And so alien almost. I don’t get it.

Please offer some help/guidance,1,sgtnzy,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sgtnzy/not_sure_if_im_thinking_properly_please_offer/,1,"Hello all, as someone recently diagnosed  body dysmorphia, I’m not sure if I’m thinking properly, so I wanted some input from others. I have a small cigarette burn (1 cm or so) on my forearm that I have longed to get removed. I know that others cannot really notice it, and I have never ever been concerned about others seeing it and judging me. For the first 1.5 years that I had it, I wanted to remove it eventually because it reminded me of a time that I did something bad to myself (burned myself). However, I did not think about the scar all the time, and it did not dictate my life whatsoever. As I made the tough transition from graduating college into the adult world last summer, my thoughts regarding the scar warped, and I became increasingly fixated on it. My mind began telling me that I cannot live with the scar on my arm. It began telling me that it doesn’t matter what you do: get it removed, a scar will still be there, cover it with a tattoo, etc, you can’t take back what you did. I think about this scar all day every day now, and I can hyper fixate on it whenever I want (it’s on my dominant forearm). I have recently started OCD/BDD treatment, which I’m hoping will help. However, I have a question for you all. I have been hoping that when I get better, I can still get the scar removed. The psychiatrist who runs my program stated that this is fine, as long as when I do it, I no longer “fear” the scar and it does not dictate my thinking/life. The logical part of my mind, that remains, knows that I will still have a scar after the original one is removed (I don’t think that my skin is going to magically heal perfectly). However, as I said earlier, before all of this turned unhealthy, I wanted to get the scar revised so that it didn’t look like a cigarette burn, so that didn’t have a constant reminder of what I did to myself. I was planning on scheduling my scar revision surgery for months out from now, like May or June (or even further), so that, if I do decide to do it, I do it after my program (should be done in March) and when I am in a better place with my body and mind. Do you all consider self-harm scar revision to be an “unnecessary” surgical procedure? That’s what I am wondering essentially. It was something that I always wanted to do before all of this started, and now I just can’t tell the difference between right and wrong. Is self harm scar revision normal? Or is it compulsive?",1643607804.0

I don’t like wearing makeup, just normally use a powder foundation if I’m stepping out, but i apply that in the dark too. Been really struggling.

I have completely given up on being loved,55,sfnu00,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sfnu00/i_have_completely_given_up_on_being_loved/,20,"So, I 20F have decided I do not want to date anyone. At least not until i turn 30..or maybe never..it all depends on how I age.

I have a very young looking face, one that people would refer to as neotenous, but one that I would refer to as visibly underdeveloped, small and deformed looking.
I have to come to terms with the fact that my facial structure probably won’t change in the next few years..at least not drastically and to the extent that
1.I’d go from looking like a 12-15 year old at most to a grown woman
2. I wish it would

Before continuing, I would like to beg anyone to refrain from comments like “You’ll be thankful for it when you’re older” “You’ll look great as you age, at 40 you’ll look like 20..” etc..as these enrage me 

Not only is a babyface, the way mine is shaped not guaranteed to look good or younger with age, as well as there being the risk of ending up like those people from the 13or30 sub…considering I have bad bone structure and pre jowls and horrible eyebags
but the downsides of looking significantly younger imo outweigh any potential benefits of it..most of which I don’t think are benefits at all..

My body isn’t much better, I’m petite, small built..childlike, with very narrow shoulders and hips..I once calculated my hip size in inches and it turned out to be way below average for a woman..Someone on a sub actually commented that that is not the normal hip size for a woman but for a teen starting puberty..it just reinforced my already poor self image


My face, my humongous bulgy eyes disgust me..my pouty small lips, my facial expression is so childlike as well, like an actual kid, a confused stupid looking kid…there is absolutely nothing attractive about me, no matter how old I get, I will never be attractive or hot, or sexy..it would be possible to maybe be perceived as pretty and only if I could compensate with a personality, but to be seen by someone as physically desirable? No

And it breaks my heart, that I will never know what it’s like to feel like a woman, never be able to truly dress like one because my body doesn’t allow it.
I hate imagining myself being intimate with someone, it’s like they would be with a child…

I’ve thought about kms honestly, because I don’t want to live a life so unfulfilled and filled with embarrassment, shame and disgust over myself. Having to justify my lack of achievements, relationships and goals in general…There is no way I could ever accept myself, let alone love myself, nor is it a goal of mine.
I just need a way to cope with living this way and I struggle to find it.",1643479658.0

Just curious,4,sg01xs,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sg01xs/just_curious/,0,"Im not sure if i have bdd or if im really just very ugly (yeah i prob have bdd idk, i have never met a person as ugly as i would consider myself). But does anyone of you ever get really close to a mirror (like 1-2cm) and look really ugly?! I look in the mirror from a normal distance, turn my head a little to get em different angles and i think like yeah, in 20% of them you are fuckable. But when i get really close to the mirror i think omg wtf is going on with that face?!
Also what i really would recommend all of you (like really omg if you struggle with your aesthetics please do this) is looking in a ""true mirror"", even if it might be really off putting at first. I do this all the time, its when you stand in front of a mirror and take another handheld mirror and point it so that you see your reflection through both of the mirrors. Off putting because when you do so you dont see your ""normal"" mirrored image that you are used to see but rather the image that shows you the way other persons see you. You can set the handheld mirror in a way that you see all around your head. And really its a completely different experience than looking into a normal mirror. I started to like my ""true mirror"" self a lot more than i do my ""real"" mirror one, but really also it gives you a much more realistic view of how you look. I can really only advise you to try this out. 

Please dont mind my bad english its not my first language and also i am drunk and i just got into bed after a party, which really was a challenge for me being very uncomfortable with my looks (like my closest friends are making fun of me about it, in an indirect way bc they think i dont notice it but i do), but i am pushing myself everyday to accept myself the way i am and be confindent about it and realize that there a so much more things to worry about and just let it tell you that you too can be happy about your looks and realize that it is mostly happening inside your head.",1643514670.0

It’s so funny how I always wondered why everyone treated me so bad, like it’s so obvious. I can look at my face now and finally see what others did. This is why people pushed me into suicide, this is why people accused me of being attention seeking and unlovable, they should’ve just pushed me farther over the edge so people don’t deal with my disgusting face.

I no longer obsess over every percieved or real flaw on my face (I have icepick acne scars and hyperpigmentation, etc) which I used to cake layers of makeup on, which would just worsen the cycle of acne and it's subsequent scars since I'm also a skin picker. Most of my active acne is actually gone now since I haven't worn any, let alone layers of foundation for the past 2 years.

   Now, (and I realize how privileged this sounds) I find myself almost fearing the ""end"" of the pandemic (whenever and whatever that will look like). since someday wearing a mask in public won't be an expected thing and I'll have to deal with people seeing my bare face up close again, which I fear is going to be way harder than it used to be. Even people without these insecurities are going to feel strange or ""naked"" without masks when they finally go away since it's been over 2 years. Maybe I'll just keep the mask, lol.

And I know, people always say that the person who loves you won't care about how you look. And to be honest, that's just as bad. I want to look good enough. I want to please my partner and have their respect. I don't want them to have their friends say shit to them. I really just want to be enough. Good enough that they value me, care about me, listen to me, admire me, call me cute things and love me. But I'm not going to get it, never. I know. And I accept it. But I still wish the comments stop. I know I'm ugly. I'm living with it everyday. You don't have to tell me. Oh my God, this is so long. And I still want to talk more.



 It's okay if you don't read it. I was just venting, I didn't have anywhere else to go.

Edit: Before you guys go on about my ex boyfriend, he picked me over that other person, but it still messed me up, he said ""I just like the way they look"".",1643390986.0

Everyone around me thinks I'm good, and they compliment me on my athletics, yet, despite running 2 miles to the gym for a 45 minute workout, and then running back again, most days, I still feel fat. 

I know I have a mental problem. I know I'm fit and healthy, and its just a mental illness, and its the reason for me feeling different about myself from one minute to the next. But the disorder itself is not as logical as its victim, and can't be talked out of this way of thinking. I'm stuck forever seeing the same body in the mirror, uet viewing it differently from minute to minute. What was too fat this morning may be too skinny this evening. What was acceptable and muscular when I got up today might be weak and feeble before bed.

I have a bmi of 28.6 and I hate my body. I see so many beautiful people on there with their flat stomachs and muscles and toned legs. Even in the before pictures these people all look so much better than me. I'll see someone who weighs more than me at my height and they look great, while I'm over here with folds and rolls. I'm humiliated by my body. I hate my breasts and how they're the opposite of firm and perky. My partner loves fake breasts (all breasts really, but they particularly like fake ones) and mine are quite literally the opposite. I hate being naked, I can't get completely undressed for sex because I don't want my partner to see me and get turned off. It's never happened before but I just don't know how they could ever be attracted to me. I hate that all my folds get sweaty, I hate that I have to lift my breasts up just to rinse under them in the shower. 

I just want to lose weight and stop feeling like an ugly fat piece of garbage. I went to Disney with my partner and every single picture we took I felt disgusting in. My face is uneven, my skin is all flawed, I have no jaw line, my body is massive, it just sucked. I've been losing weight very slowly and while that's nice I can tell no difference in my body. I just want to feel as pretty as people have told me I am. My partner once said that DiVinci would've sculpted me out of marble because of how I look, and it was a wonderful compliment, but how do I actually get to feel that way about myself? I feel like my individual features are attractive but when they're all put together on my face they just fall so short of beautiful. I'm tolerable at best. My insecurities are starting to make my relationship more complicated because I just can't deal with certain things. I'm exhausted.

"Places like rateme amiugly, etc. are insanely unhealthy and ran by dishonest mods",108,sd7929,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sd7929/places_like_rateme_amiugly_etc_are_insanely/,32,"Mostly because the ones posting there might not necessarily be aware that they have BDD, and the mods there do absolutely nothing to help prevent mental health issues.

There is something as objective attractiveness, and it has everything to do with lighting and composition. Not with makeup, hairlines, skin care, etc. You can make anyone look good with the right lighting and with the proper lens. I've tried posting meta posts there trying to educate people on how to properly take a picture of themselves, but the mods there would rather others berate someone's appearance because that person didn't realize that the wide angle lens they're using over-exaggerates their features.

Subjective attractiveness, on the other hand, is just that. Subjective. There are multiple studies out there that show that what you view as attractive is shaped by your life experiences.

They even did a study with [same-sex fraternal and identical twins](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.048) that experienced the exact same conditions as their brother/sister and found that even there, there were statistically significant deviations in facial attractiveness. Basically, even in homogeneous countries, an outsider will have their type and be someone's type.

In the end the only thing anyone in those subs gets rated on is how well they took a picture of themselves, but framed in a way that makes it seem like that's how people view them in person.

Interestingly, I think how we see ourselves in such a negative light might have something to do with the fact we're simply not our own type. I at least myself know that I struggle with even imagining someone being a romantic partner with me. I put myself in their shoes and know that for me I'm not my type, but I'm not that person.",1643207442.0

My BDD is almost always at the forefront of my mind and only every couple of weeks will I get one day where I feel handsome, and even on those days if I think about just trying to talk to a girl sat next to me in class I get this horrible wave of BDD and this feeling in my chest similar to guilt or fear, and because of that just end up keeping my mouth shut rather than risk my worries being true and making the other person feel worse. This has led to me feeling like a loser and I can’t even bring myself to follow anyone I know on social media because of the thought that they will see and think ‘ew, that freak wants to follow me?’. I also hang around with a friend group which seems to have no issues talking to people they like and even finding dates, which just ends up making me feel worse and continue to overthink and spiral into further sadness. The only thing that sort of helps me think it may just all be in my head is that a friend of mine who came out as gay a year or so ago rated me a 7/10 in a conversation we were having about looks and appearance a few months ago. I have been working on self improvement and working out / taking up hobbies to try boost my self esteem for a little while now but I still look in the mirror and see a different ugly face every day and the cycle just repeats.

(Genuinely because I struggle with anxiety) I guess what I’m asking is if it is ok to talk to girls as due to this torture of a mental health disorder I no longer know if I am hideously unattractive or if I am normal. Furthermore, am I going to make them feel uncomfortable or scared by trying to start a conversation because if so I will just keep my mouth shut.

"Do any of you remember the ""trigger"" that started your body dysmorphia?",16,sdgk1e,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sdgk1e/do_any_of_you_remember_the_trigger_that_started/,20,"**Trigger Warning** - people will talk about the things that triggered them, which could cause a trigger in you. Be kind to yourself if you're susceptible to that kind of thing. 



In memory, I've always been plagued by BDD or extreme insecurity in some way or another. But I think it first properly manifested itself when I was about 14. My body and mind were going through all the typical puberty changes; my nose, my hips, everything was changing. It was like I was losing my mind. Oftentimes when I was going out I'd be getting ready for hours before I would leave the house (something that is now a common occurrence), but it was still somewhat manageable. 

But the trigger where it *really* started? Grindr. There's a plethora of information about how harmful Grindr is, so I won't get into it too much. But this app messed with my head. The body standards I started prescribing myself to just so I could feel love? So I could feel touch? It was a recipe for disaster for a younger more impressionable me. It was like a bomb went off. Every visit in front of a mirror seemed to take on a different meaning after that; I was no longer trying to look to groom or take care of myself, every visit was a vitriolic critique of every feature I was born with. I hated myself because I felt like I wasn't what everyone wanted. And overtime it just got worse and worse. I haven't uploaded a photo on social media in years without deleting it before anyone else can see it. I struggle even understanding my own attractiveness, I have *no idea* what I look like objectively. None. Some people find me hot as hell, some people find me repulsive. And yeah, that's today. Medication is helping, therapy will help soon. But it's hard.

Coping with being an ugly bride.,17,sdcw5p,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sdcw5p/coping_with_being_an_ugly_bride/,9,"I apologize in advance for the massive length. I have a lot of feelings but I can't talk to anyone IRL about it and I have to vent these feelings somewhere. Also, I am currently in therapy and it's helping to manage these feelings, but I'm still carrying a lot of sadness.

Basically, I'm getting married in April and I'm so worried that I'll ruin the day for myself by fixating on being ugly. I'm trying to not think about it lest I manifest the very result I'm afraid of, but...I know myself. I know the things that set me off. And a wedding is just a recipe for disaster. I'm going to be in a crowd of people, many of which are beautiful women dressed & made up nicely. Everyone is going to be looking at me, which makes me want to die. My bridesmaids are all so pretty and every single one of them will look prettier than me just by virtue of not being me. Nothing will be able to mitigate that. I could literally force them to show up with no makeup, hair in greasy buns, and sweatpants, and they would still all look a thousand times prettier than I have ever looked or will ever look in my life.

I'm so excited to be married, and in theory to have a fun party celebrating with my friends and loved ones. But I know myself and I know something will probably set me off and I'll spend the whole night holding back tears and wishing I was dead.

And just. No one understands at all. I've stopped bothering to bring it up. When I even suggest I'm having these feelings, I get one of two reactions. At best, I get hasty reassurances that no of course I'm going to look beautiful, it's my wedding day, etc etc. To be honest, that sentiment makes me feel so much worse. I know it's well-intentioned, but it just reinforces my feeling like I'm not worthy to be a bride because I'm *not* pretty. At worst, I get eyerolls and reactions like I'm fishing for compliments. Sometimes, people say like ""it doesn't matter how you look! It's just about you and your fiance and celebrating your love!"" On the one hand, yeah, like, that's true - but it's just really infuriating to hear this from beautiful confident women who have no idea what this disorder feels like. People say like ""oh we all feel insecure sometimes"" but it's not insecurity and it's not merely *sometimes* - it's 24/7, and it's not insecurity. I'm certain, absolutely certain, that I am hideous and always will be.

My friends and family keep telling me that it's different on your wedding day, and that I can't possibly know I'll feel ugly and me thinking I will is just going to make it happen, but...like...I've literally never once felt pretty for one second in my entire life. I have no reason to believe that's suddenly going to change just because I'm getting married that day. Also, sometimes when I've talked about this I get (again, well-intentioned) advice on workout routines & such to lose weight, but my body isn't the main source of my sadness. I'm more overweight than I'd like to be, and I don't exactly have a great body, but like, it's fine. Being chubby doesn't bother me *that* much, but being ugly does. It's my face that I hate. It's always been my face.

I want to be pretty, or at the very least not ugly, more than anything in the world. My fiance deserves a pretty wife. I don't understand why he likes me, physically or otherwise. Everyone's like ""you're getting married so obviously your fiance finds you pretty"" and I follow that reasoning, but it's just so contrary to what I *see* in the mirror and nothing makes any sense to me.

We're not hiring a photographer, for a lot of reasons. My fiance doesn't want one either, for non-BDD reasons, though I think if I had wanted one he'd be fine with hiring one. I don't care about not having formal photos, honestly I think most posed formal photos at weddings look super corny and lame so I won't miss those. But the candids. I do wish we could have some high-quality candids. I want to have nice shots of me smiling at my new husband over dinner, or us laughing with our friends. But the thing is, knowing that I'm being followed around by a photographer would absolutely ruin my night. I have a legitimate, crippling phobia of being photographed by anyone but myself (I can handle selfies since I can adjust my face angle/expression in real time and I have control over whether anyone sees it or not). And it's just not worth it to spend thousands on photos that I know for a fact I will hate. Whenever I see a photo of myself taken by someone else, I get legitimately suicidal afterward. I've had my photo professionally taken before, for senior photos and family weddings etc, and it never makes a difference how good the photographer is. There is no possible way to take my picture without me looking ugly. We're doing a photobooth so we can have at least a couple high-quality pictures of ourselves together, but that doesn't solve the problem of not getting candids. But whatever.

I don't really have the budget for a hair & makeup artist, and even if I did, it would make no difference at best and make me feel even uglier at worst. I'm just planning to do a bit of eye makeup because my eyes are the only parts of my face that aren't completely hideous, but otherwise that's all I'm doing. Makeup doesn't make me look prettier. I'm ugly in a way that makeup cannot possibly fix. It's like putting lipstick on a pig, to use an expression (though I hate the expression cause pigs are adorable lol). It just draws attention to all my flaws and it looks absolutely ridiculous. But I'm sad about this too. I wish I could feel the joy that brides are supposed to, of being primped and preened and feeling beautiful on their wedding day. But I can't afford those things and even if I could, it wouldn't make a difference.

I feel preemptively humiliated. Everyone is going to be looking at me and I feel like everyone is going to be thinking like, ""who is she kidding?"" Of course no one will *say* that, because at weddings you have to pretend the bride is the most beautiful woman in the room. But I'm going to be the ugliest. Because I always am.

I'm just so sad. I have a beautiful dress and I love how it flatters my figure, but then I look at my face and suddenly I feel so stupid. I have no right to walk around in this big beautiful feminine gown when I have this disgusting hideous face attached to me. I've mostly come to terms with the fact that feeling pretty is a joy I'll never get to experience, but the lead-up to the wedding is dredging up all my sadness again.

TL;DR - I'm an ugly bride and I'm sad about it. Has anyone else on here had to deal with these feelings? I don't even need advice, necessarily (though if you have some feel free to offer it) but I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this. I feel so sad and so alone.",1643222065.0
"You would always remember that one comment, or that one moment, etc.",29,sd71oj,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sd71oj/you_would_always_remember_that_one_comment_or/,17,"So I (F25) have been talking to this girl for over 7 months now and we've seen each other's pictures and plan to meet up soon.

She likes to do video calls but I only did it once because I had a panic attack right after. It came to a point where I even just got stuck in one position and didn't do anything else during the call. She also likes sending pictures and kindly asking for mine. I've told her countless times that I don't take a lot of pictures if myself but I told her I would do it for you when I can. I can never tell her that I think I look like a monster, that's why I don't take selfies. She says it's okay but sometimes misses me and wants my pictures. She would also sometimes ask to VC if we could, and I'd get quiet and would think very hard on the words I would say to explain myself, because I used to lash out or it would start into a fight because I would be all defensive because I didn't want to admit that I'm just really hideous and I know it. Despite me thinking I'm nothing but a monstrous face, I still have stupid pride so I never admit that to anyone.

Anyway, I am once again dreading our meet-up in the future because tonight I remembered that one time I was talking to this happy-go-lucky and sweet and beautiful girl 3 years ago. Of course it was online. She told me she found me cute from my DP and everything, and that I am smart, etc. Until she made me send my pictures and she was all nice and you look cute and everything. But she slowly stopped talking to me.

To think, sending pictures to one another would make you closer, huh. HA!

I know it was just one incident. It was that one time. But I *KNOW*. I know...

Even remembering this now makes me emotional and teary-eyed because that's one of those times where I really hated myself. For trying to be cool about noticing that girl's distancing from me, about me casually sending her an update about my day and funny things that happened lately at the time, and she was trying to be nice, ""I'm glad you had fun"", when she used to send lengthy messages and would stay up at night with me...me being pathetic for hoping for days and a month that she'd talk to me again. But I know...

That one memory keeps replaying in my head right now and what if, this girl I've been talking to for nearly a year...what if she sees me and turns the other way soon as she sees me...

She's told me she really likes me and wants to do lots of things with me more and stuff.

My BDD head is all: ""You're saying that now. Wait till you see my face. Haha I'm trash. You're gonna be running the other way so fast it'll make your head spin. I promise you that""

This friend coerced me into doing sexual acts with her, and I was petrified and hurt, and scared. It only sucked because in the midst of an action I didn’t consent to, I was experiencing my body having sexual responses to those stimulations for the first time. 

Because she was also a girl, I never really mentioned it. But on a deeper level, I never mentioned it because:
1) She was smaller than me
2) She was much prettier than me
3) I must have wanted it and it must have been my fault because in my mind, “If I wasn’t so ugly and fat, she wouldn’t think I’d like this.”
4) Why would she choose to coerce me or force me into such things because I wasn’t even a pretty girl to do that to? 
5) Shame. Shame all around. 


I know this line of thinking is all problematic but in many ways, while I know people like myself who aren’t socially beautiful are harmed or done wrong/made uncomfortable, I never felt I was someone who could be harmed because no one cared.

These events oddly made my body dysmorphia worse and made me hate my body so so so much more.

An uncle of mine who used to voluntarily counsel me about my weight  and how overweight I was, was physically violent towards me and beat me as if I was a grown man once. In fact, he tried to kill me. My mom watched. That made it worse. I didn’t do anything to warrant this. I was a little girl and he beat me as if I was a grown man, he was going to throw a vase at me which would have killed me. My grandma interferes with the commotion. My mom blamed me but claims she did not.

When I think back on this, I think of how much times of my life where all I wanted to be was treated softly and delicately. I was bullied and teased for my weight and looks. And I think that’s why more than anything I have such complex feelings about perpetual girlhood. I got a chance to be a little girl, but so much of my experience was wanting to be like other little girls because of their looks and their bodies, the way they were validated. I wanted that too. 

So, when my friend coerced me sexually as a kid into that situation which I don’t feel like going into, I felt like it must mean I’m disgusting. It must mean that I’m the weird one, that my looks, my body, everything wrong with me is the reason why this happened. If I was pretty like her, it wouldn’t happen. I know that’s illogical but because when bad things happens to me, I was either blamed or not listened to, this way of thinking follows me.

Even when bad things happen to me, I blame my looks. Because I just feel if I was beautiful, some people would think twice. This doesn’t mean beautiful people are not harmed, I just think in my case, I have been so discarded and hurt by people but because I’m not beautiful-it doesn’t matter. I am just wondering if others with BDD also have a hard time believing they too can be victims of vicious acts? I’m asking because since I see myself as ugly, I kind of just believe that my looks make me susceptible to these acts in a different way considering people respond to ugliness with violence, confusion, curiosity and humiliation. 

I also have never been complimented by a man, so these acts have also caused me to believe that no gender is safe for me to be around.",1643217531.0

It's not even serious and people probably will never even notice it but I've been so angry and it's been days. I'm getting invisalign rn so I cant build back any teeth shape until I finish my sets (or else my teeth might not fit in the trays that I already paid for). I told him I liked them pointier and that I wanted them to be rebuilt back to how they naturally were. He said that ""we can re-evaluate to get the best shape we want"". WE? ITS MY TEETH. YOU dulled them WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Plus maybe I'm just picky or crazy but it's just not the same. He took something I really liked about myself and said ""it's ok"" because he can build it back artificially.

We keep chatting and he asked how big it was. I figured, why lie. Be honest. So I said “6.3 inches. But it’s thicc and people have told me the head is kinda big.” 

He responds back with “😂😂😂 I want you 8+. Sorry. I’m weird.” It hit me right in my body dysmorphia. Needless to say, I deleted that conversation with a quickness and am staying my ass inside for the night. Might go look up penis enlargement surgeries.

I have become such a terrible person to people I find attractive. If I have a crush on someone I make myself hate them, if I find someone attractive I have problems taking their issues seriously. 


Im not trying to be this way, I’m constantly trying to stop myself from thinking like this but still. Every once and awhile I realize how terrible I am and I’m filled with guilt, I never go out of my way to make attractive people feel bad but I still find myself being very critical of them in my thoughts.


I guess I’m mostly just jealous but sometimes it does make me feel bad, I see their issues as almost insignificant because their attractive. It comes back to that feeling of “you’re pretty so everyone else takes you seriously so I don’t need to” I know, it’s horrible. This is a lot of the reason I lock myself away so much, I don’t want anyone judging me and I don’t wanna judge others, I get so angry at someone for just being conventionally attractive or just having good features in general.


Seriously, if you have a small nose, no matter what the rest of you looks like all I see is your nose. Sometimes people call themselves unattractive and I get angry because I see good features like if your face is balanced to any degree I see you as better looking than me. Same with jaws, you have a decent jaw? You’re more attractive than me and therefore have more potential than I ever will and I have a harder time seeing you and your issues as significant.

Does anyone else not date?,42,sccm6t,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sccm6t/does_anyone_else_not_date/,12,"I am 29 years old and don’t date. I would say it’s by choice but it’s also because I can’t date seeing as I am unattractive. 

I’m aware that people who’re also deemed “ugly” as I am do date, and they may also have body dysmorphia, yet still date while I don’t/can’t. They deserve to be loved, but my case is just much different. 

It’s weird explaining to people that I can’t date because I’m ugly. And nobody would ever find me attractive. It’s very difficult to think about this as someone who is not just unattractive but also is clinically diagnosed with BDD because people don’t seem to understand. I wish I could understand what it’s like to be wanted or found beautiful, but I’m just not. It truly hurts my soul. The only people deranged enough to “give me a chance” are unfortunately unnamed unhinged individuals who are predators and/or people who have no self-esteem, self-love, taste or sense and that’s not good. 


I wish I could be like other girls and think of these fun things but because I am such a physical disgrace, I can’t think about dating or being loved. I’m sick and tired of people saying “awe 😫!” Awe, what? Awe, what a pathetic creature and genetic mistake—yes. I can’t help but to deeply fantasize about being another woman. I don’t even see myself as a woman because I’m just so physically terrible and a mistake. I have never seen someone have nothing going for them physically in the ways that I do. I have absolutely nothing redeemable physically. 


I’m tired of being considered an amazing “person” because that means nothing. It just means people like to talk to you for comfort. I don’t necessarily want to date but I wish I had the option to at least try and be normal. I don’t. It is so painful. Having a crush is painful because on the rare occasion I do, I know that they’d NEVER, not in a cat in hell’s chance, ever be into me which is okay. I just feel bad because I have no value. I wonder what it is like to be found attractive by someone who is great and not a predator/unhinged, lying individual.


It really hurts to know I will never experience this. I will never experience being seen as a beautiful girl/woman. I work hard to fix what’s wrong with me and I have come to regretful terms that I will need surgical help, I will resent this but I will be doing something that will be a means to a soft end. I will always be down about being so hideous and worthless physically (trust me, I have never seen someone so disgusting and unappealing looking. Not ONE good thing physically about me, it’s like I was punished by God’s imagination). 

I’m aware that most people here have BDD but are not “unattractive” as I am so I am not speaking as a voice as a side for this community but I guess I’m speaking for people in my position. I’d like to be clear that I am not of the belief anyone owes me love or has to find me attractive! That’s not true at all and I would never be angered about that, I am just angry at myself. I am angry that I am just despicable and all around pathetic. I cry seeing other girls just be so naturallly perfect. I don’t believe I should be called a girl or woman, certainly not a woman, because I am so worthless and physically a mistake. It hurts so bad. I am 29 and a virgin which is fine, yet, I have the body of someone who is 105 years old with 15 children, and even she would probably have a better body and looks. I just am reminded that I have nothing at all.

I have a bad body, bad shape, bad skin, piece of crap skin actually, the worst hair smfh, blemishes, the worst features, just worthless. I’m sorry to share my ugliness here as I’m aware BDD does not mean someone is ugly, I just happen to be dealing with both.

I feel like I look like a boy. My mum couldn't be bothered to deal with lice when I was in primary school, and so she shaved the entirety of my head. I was bullied and ostracised relentlessly.

Being ugly is a curse,49,sc4sz9,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sc4sz9/being_ugly_is_a_curse/,22,"I stared at myself in the camera for a while and just wanted to cry. Why did I have to be cursed with such an ugly appearance? Why do some people get to be beautiful while I (and others) are forced to live as unattractive people? What did I do to deserve this. I’m sorry for everything. I just want to like my appearance. I don’t need everyone to think I’m beautiful, but could I at least be objectively pretty? All of my facial features are manly and disgusting. My wide jaw, deep set eyes, masculine nose, big and weirdly shaped lips, dark eyebrows, chubby cheeks. Why me. I am so sorry please give me a chance to be beautiful. I can’t take this anymore. I will never be able to be happy while looking like this. I don’t have any friends because everyone is more attractive than me and makes me feel jealous. My ugliness has made me terrified of showing my personality to others. If I was prettier maybe my weirdness could be accepted, but I’m not going to showcase my personality just to face even more social isolation. I’m 18 and haven’t even had my first kiss. I’m extremely gross looking and undesirable. I wish I could get a restart on life as a more attractive person. This is no way to live.",1643084047.0

I exposed myself to my insecurities and made myself deal with it. It’s kind of similar to the Exposure therapy used for ocd, but my own version of it.

I'm so tired. I can't take this anymore. Every second of my day is spent obsessing over my physical appearance and it completely ruined my life.,67,sbuu5v,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbuu5v/im_so_tired_i_cant_take_this_anymore_every_second/,10,"I'm so tired. Every single waking moment is spent thinking about my physical appearance. Actually, even my dreams are related to my looks.

I'm being consumed by my thoughts. I don't leave my house anymore if not strictly necessary.

Everytime I'm outside and someone looks at me I feel like I'm dying. I developed social anxiety because of my obsession with my looks. I'm not attractive and insecure, I'm genuinely ugly but I see myself 100 worse and obsess over it constantly. 

When someone is talking to me I can't concentrate on the conversation: ""do I look weird right now? Am I making an ugly face? Should I look a bit more to the left since that's my best angle? Don't make exaggerated expressions. Don't smile like that-- don't talk like that. I should just cover up my face.""

I'm so broke and I can't even bring myself to look for a job because I simply can't function around people. I just can't.

I spent most of my day thinking about how I look and dreaming of plastic surgery. I fantasize about my future where I'm pretty and people like me. I dream of having a boyfriend for the first time in 20 years. I dream of being able to go to the store without feeling every single person looking at me in disgust. I fantasize about waking up and not crying because I have my face. In my fantasy world, I post selfies on Instagram and people want to interact with me. I'm funny, I'm pretty and I'm liked.

But I'm none of those things. I look disgusting and my personality is even worse. I'm a spiteful, hateful person. I resent happy people. I'm unable to feel happy for others.

I spend my time miserable, looking at my pictures until I feel worse. Until I find new flaws. I don't have money for plastic surgery. I don't even have money to cheer myself up by buying clothes that may make me feel somewhat pretty. 

I'm so tired of existing like this. I haven't lived in years, I'm just surviving.",1643054054.0

The way I felt about myself (which I felt ugly) would ruin my mood for the rest of my day (sometimes for a whole week). I became jealous of girls who were prettier than me knowing damn well that I could be jealous of them all I want, I'll never look like them. I tried everything to become good looking. I tried to put on makeup, do skincare, I even tried to convince myself and everyone around me that I was cute. I successfully convinced myself and I became delusional about the way I looked (which is the reason why there was a rumour about me ""thinking that  I'm cute😒""). Unfortunately, everybody could see that I was ugly still. I didn't fool anybody. My point is I've became obsessed with my looks and trying to glow-up, but it's not my weight, ance, or clothing that's making me ugly. It's something more permanent...it's my facial structure.

I (28F) am scared that my husband (29M) will get fed with my inability to have sex.,8,sc3o71,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sc3o71/i_28f_am_scared_that_my_husband_29m_will_get_fed/,5,"

I find myself mentally spiraling recently. My husband (29M) and I (28F) don’t have sex very often (in my personal opinion). I understand that spouses/couples have sex at different frequencies. My husband and I have been married for 2 years, together for 5. And we have sex once maybe every 2 months. Every time we want it, either I initiate or he does, something always happens to me. I really want to have sex and I want to please him. But whenever my clothes are off, I can’t get out of my head. I want to hide and cover myself up. I start to panic and I start to cry. I no longer can let “loose” or enjoy the moment and the connection. I am terrified of him looking at my body. I am disgusted with myself and I think he will be also if he looks at me. He has NEVER pressured me. Made me feel bad for stopping or crying. He feels awful when I try to hide my tears to get through it. But I am so terrified that one day he will get fed up with it.  I know he has needs and I want to take care of him. I have needs to, which I take care of when he leaves. I have seen his search history for porn and I know he goes off to assist himself. I can’t and don’t get mad. It hurts that I have put him in that position. His initiation for sex has decreased considerably. I feel that he doesn’t try because he knows it’s gonna cause me pain. That’s no way to live and we don’t have children yet. 

I confided in my Mother about this. She told me that, “If he isn’t getting it from you, he is gonna get it from someone else.” That broke my heart. It has resulted to me hiding tequila in the bathroom to take a few shots to take the edge off. It helps but it’s not real for me. I don’t want to be “medicated” to have sex with my husband. I am jealous of people who have healthy and fulfilling sex lives. I want to enjoy my life and be rid of this guilt that I feel. 

I obviously have extremely low-self esteem. I know.  I am seeing, and have been, seeing a therapist.  Have been on anti-depressants and tranquilizers for insomnia. I shower with the lights off. I avoid mirrors some days while trying to find my reflection in any surface other days. I have to wait until he leaves the room to change clothes. He no longer looks at me, out of respect. I have history of sexual abuse/trauma which started when I was 5 and ended a few years later. This person was someone from my immediate family and someone who made me feel awful for my body. But I don’t think about that when my husband and I get intimate. My therapist says that it relates but I don’t see how. Maybe she isn’t even explaining it to me well enough for me to understand. I’d love to hear your opinion. These problems have slowly been getting worse. When we first dated I was better and more free. 

It hurts to think that I am taking away something so beautiful and natural between two people. I have never felt connected unless I’m an drunk. Then the next day it’s like it never happened. I don’t feel anything when I receive compliments. 

My question to you is, have you ever experienced something like this during a relationship? How did you work through it with your partner? What are some ways you helped ease the anxiety? Have you been a partner to someone like me? What was your thought process? Was it hard for you? 

TL;DR I can’t have sex with my husband because I am afraid of what he thinks of me. I am afraid if I don’t have sex with him enough, he will leave me.",1643080560.0

On one hand I’m kinda relieved I got rejected. I didn’t really wanna have s** with this person but when you’re ho*** at 4 AM your thinking is skewed. At least they told me I was hot? They didn’t have to say that. They could’ve ghosted or sent an “ew no”. But they chose to tell me “you’re hot” before the rejection. So maybe I’m not the ugly duckling I’ve always seen myself as? 

Or tried to let me down easy. I mean, there are lots of reasons someone could get rejected on an app at 4 AM. And I wasn’t owed anything. 

I just find it interesting that someone actually thought I was “hot”. Yeah it didn’t lead to 3rd base. But maybe I’m not the ugly duckling nerd I thought I was.",1643108644.0

She has never called me pretty but always says, “You have such a beautiful soul.” And also, she always speaks to me as if I’m in need of helping when I actually help her because there’s nothing she can “help” me with. I have noticed with conventional attractive women that they do this with their ugly friends, and it’s quite obvious. They can dress “regularly” and get approached.

I’m starting to feel crazy because I will literally look at myself in my bedroom mirror and then I will go to the bathroom and stare at myself for a little and then go back to my other mirror and the cycle just keeps going, I go back in forth between mirrors and then I get frustrated because a whole hour will go by and I still do not know how I look.

BDD in relationships,13,sbgl39,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbgl39/bdd_in_relationships/,3,"for any of you that suffer from body dysmorphia and are in a relationship, how does it affect your relationship? for me, my insecurity is extremely heightened. even though i enjoy sex with my partner, i am constantly needing validation from him and i am so self conscious. i am constantly comparing myself to other women that my mind tells me he would rather have. i am always convincing myself that he doesnt actually think i'm beautiful. will this ever get better? i love him so much, it's not our relationship that is wrong. it's my illness.",1643009924.0
Trying to make me feel better by dissing other women does NOT help.,32,sbawrx,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbawrx/trying_to_make_me_feel_better_by_dissing_other/,1,"It’s not gonna help the way I feel about myself if you criticize other women’s body’s/faces, it makes it worse. I don’t like that people think it’s gonna soothe me to hear them call other women ugly? I’m already self conscious and now you’re insulting other people’s features. If I mention Angelina Jolie or something and you say “I find her ugly anyways!” How do you think that’s helping? You just called a beautiful woman ugly and expect me to feel great now that you just called someone with near perfect features ugly.


Also I hate it when people say “well all the pretty girls I went to high school with got fat and ugly anyways” dude two things wrong with that 1 I’ve already struggled with an eating disorder and fear of aging and you’ve now said those two fears actually make you unattractive? 2 who says I won’t also turn out like that? Who says I won’t become “fat And ugly” and have people that I used to know tell their daughters how terrible I look.


And it ALSO confirms that people ARE thinking about my appearance! You really think you can sit there and tell me that “people are too self obsessed to think about you anyways” yet you remember the pretty girl from high school who got fat? You remember my skinny grade 5 best friend who made me feel ugly? You remember all of those people and talk to OTHER PEOPLE about how ugly you think they were, yet you expect me to believe nobody ever does that to me? I’m literally hearing you constantly insult and belittle people because you didn’t like them and now you expect me to believe that people “don’t think about you”


Not only that but sometimes you accidentally confirm that some insecurities I see myself having you actually find unattractive, “oh well you don’t have like uneven eyes or some crooked nose” yes I do. “Oh look at her she has no curves” neither do I.


Sorry for the long post btw. I honestly understand that people are just trying to make me feel better but I don’t like it. it’s belittling other women and it makes me feel worse.",1642991288.0

How do I believe I’m beautiful?,1,sbvifj,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbvifj/how_do_i_believe_im_beautiful/,1,"I often like what I see in the mirror and think I’m pretty when I see my reflection.

So why in the world do I not really believe I’m beautiful? It’s like I’m constantly searching for more and more proof that I am, and am internally become desperate for validation rather than believing my own eyes when I like my own reflection. I don’t understand why I care so much either. Why should it matter? I tie my own self worth to my appearance. I know the answer is therapy but I want to know if others have experience dealing with the same thing. How do I believe I’m beautiful?",1643055776.0

What they don't warn you about when it comes to fat loss..,7,sbgmzl,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbgmzl/what_they_dont_warn_you_about_when_it_comes_to/,3,"So, you may think to yourself that if you could just loose that stubborn 50 + pounds your life would be so much better. But, lemme tell you a cautionary tale of...stretch marks and saggy/loose skin. I've lost in the ballpark of about 70 lbs over the last year and a half, long story short, it's helped my physical health but my mental health has suffered for it. 

If you are already hyper sensitive about your body, I would advise loosing any weight slower to avoid these marks because damn. I thought I didn't want to look at my naked body before. It some days is a chore to look at my body in a mirror, like, ""oh cool, that's a lot of weight off my waist"" but also ""man those stretch marks on my fat  hips don't make them look any better."" It is a loosing battle if you want quick results.

Yeah I look much better in clothing but I am now horrified beyond belief looking at what has become of myself. And my weight loss journey isn't even over. So. Be safe. Loose weight over a long period of time to avoid insane, long, dark stretch marks. You probably will encounter them regardless, but I am hoping that they won't take over your life like it has mine. They're literally everywhere and I cannot stand to be naked for more than the time it takes to change or shower. And creams don't really help the loose skin and the brutal marks on areas where you carry extra fat. So, be cautious. Be smart. Loose it slow. And keep trucking.",1643010095.0
"ON RECOVERY - Stories, advice and healthier perspective",2,sblovw,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sblovw/on_recovery_stories_advice_and_healthier/,0,"Recovery from BDD might sometimes feel like a distant goal that seems, at times, impossible to achieve. But many people recover from BDD or learn to reduce the symptoms to the point where they don't play a role in their everyday life. Remember that a mental disorder is not a life long sentence but rather something that can be managed and recovered from.

Here we have collected a set of stories and advice on what recovery looks like and how others have gotten there.

i hate how everything revolves around my body.,5,sbfk10,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbfk10/i_hate_how_everything_revolves_around_my_body/,2,"I’m so over everything. I have tests to study for, projects to do, work to go to, friends to hang out with. And somehow, thoughts of my body surround all of me, and sometimes I can’t help but talk about it. And I know if annoys the people around me, but I can’t stop myself. And I hate it because I can feel their annoyance at me nitpicking at myself. But I can’t help it. The thoughts are always there. I want to stop too. But I can’t. I have thoughts 24/7 of how much I hate my body and how I can lose weight and starve myself. And how it never happens because I also have a binge eating disorder. And how much my body has changed in the past few months. I hate myself so much. 

I was picking an outfit to wear tomorrow and went to try on a pair of jeans I bought over the summer that I haven’t worn in awhile, and they didn’t fit. At all. I couldn’t even button the first button. And I started crying. Because they used to fit perfectly with room around the waist. Now I can’t even put them over my thoughts. It makes me so mad that I “let myself go” but even more mad that I have thoughts like this. Most of the people I know would get accept it and get a new pair of jeans, because that’s just how life is, right? You get over what you can’t change. 

But why is it so different from me? Why do I have thoughts of *tw* kms and cutting the fat off myself because I gained 10 pounds? Why can’t I just be normal. 

Why do I have to annoy people with the talk of my body when I can sense their uncomfortableness. I don’t do it for validation, I just don’t have anyone else to talk to about if, and if I kept all of my thoughts to myself I’d go crazy. I don’t want it to seem like I’m seeking validation, because I think some of my friends think that, and I just feel worse that i’m even thinking like this in the first place. idk what to do.",1643006078.0
How do you handle the compulsive need to validate yourself in the mirror?

"I don't know if bdd can have a proper treatment or therapy while people don't pay attention to things like ""pretty privilege""",24,sb4756,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sb4756/i_dont_know_if_bdd_can_have_a_proper_treatment_or/,3,"I'm not an expert but i believe that some form of pretty privilege do exist in our society so of course some people will be affected by it positively and others negatively.

It's very hard to talk about it and be against it because of how convenient it is for the beauty industry to make us into little insecure puppets desperate to fit in with ""pretty people"" and convince us that only they are allowed to be liked, happy and have fun. ​

Like idk... i've been trying to save money for some plastic surgeries not because i really need them, every part of my body does what it has to do. But i feel that if i don't look a certain specific way i will not be accepted by others. Like there is something inherently wrong with me because i'm not ""pretty"". 

And yeah therapy can take care of our anxieties and it does help in many ways but it can't change how the whole world will treat us, you know? 

And in the end plastic surgery is not salvation or even a good thing for people that don't need it and there's a reason a lot of doctors stay away from people with bdd as far as they can. 

I'm sorry but I really believe that the beauty industry is rotting everyone's brains.

Self Obsessed,3,sbh9dm,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sbh9dm/self_obsessed/,0,"Body dysmorphia is one aspect of a broader disorder I have, but it feels like everything in my life is revolved around what I look like, all the time.  At times I feel so incredibly vain, even though I’m only looking at myself in order to prove something I’ve yet to see.  I stare at my reflection hoping one day It’ll some how change for the better. I take pictures of myself on my phone not because I feel I look good, but because I want to make sure I’m not unacceptable. I always feel unacceptable anyway, but I save the picture to compare it to my future self and other past images.  This helps me feel at least a little more safe in what I look like, bc even if I’m ugly, at least it’s consistent and not getting worse. If anyone got a glimpse of my camera roll I would seem totally and utterly self obsessed. This is because I am,  but not in the way people commonly think. Most people when getting a peak at my photos make an understandable  judgment, which I can’t really say much to. Someone tells me I take a lot of selfies… What would I even say back? “all these pictures only exist because I want to make sure even if I’m horrid looking, at least I can have consistency in each pic I take” …? That doesn’t make it sound much better than just being labeled self obsessed. To make it worse, I have an unbearable fear that people will see pictures of me and think I’m trying too hard for how I look. The only thing keeping me from insanity feels like the consistency of my pictures, and mirror reflections. Soon enough I’ll grow older, and I won’t look the same- and then will come a whirlwind of the same “self obsessed” comments. This time though,  it can no longer be seen as “innocent insecurity”,  I’ll be older, more “mature” and I’ll be acting like a fantasy witch whose beauty is taken from her, except I never had any in the first place. 

In all honesty, I don’t expect comments- you can if you want- but I just really needed to witness myself say something outside of my own head. Sometimes I get stuck.",1643012467.0

I don't even know if I'm ugly or attractive. I really don't know. I don't want to keep going. But I will. I don't know what it is that makes me keep going. I don't want to but I will. I hate it. I'm crying as I type this. I hate this so much. 

My mind won't stop obsessing over all the times I made her laugh and all the times I went out on walks with her. I can't help but think that it's because of how I look that she rejected me. Maybe if I wasn't that skinny, maybe if I had manlier hands and smaller eyes and more attractive features overall she wouldn't reject me. Why do I believe such an irrational possibility? Why does my mind think this way? I don't want it to. Ever. I want to be happy and content with my appearance without having to put in the effort of doing so. 

If she hadn't rejected me maybe this feeling would all go away, my self doubt, bdd everything would vanish because whenever I was around her it was like these feelings were never there.

Not worthy of love?,9,sb050q,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sb050q/not_worthy_of_love/,0,"I know confidence is key but I literally won’t make the first move when it comes to guys.  Anytime a guy approaches me, I don’t even try to entertain em. I always think “I highly doubt they will accept all my flaws.”
I have severe body dysmorphia because I have a lazy eye with a slight turn. It’s much larger than my other eye too. People always say they don’t notice it but if you’re around me everyday, one will eventually notice it. My last ex didn’t notice it at first but after like a year together he finally noticed. He was pretty disgusted by it. I don’t know if I’ll ever get over that. I never told him about it before hand. On top of that I always had eating disorders and weight issues from being pretty skinny to being overweight so I never really felt comfortable in my body. Because of that I have a very disfigured looking body now. I have alot of skin issues, which adds to the body dysmorphia. Mostly moderate acne on my face right now with severe breakouts every so often. It was severe in my adolescence. I’ve tried 100’s of acne products with no success. I also get weird bumps in certain areas of my body that take a long time to go away. Some visible, some not. I wouldn’t say I’m unattractive but I’m not super attractive. Now that I’m getting older and uglier (my eye is going to start turning more) and dudes stare at me (this doesn’t happen often) it gives me anxiety. Like are they noticing my flaws or do they still think I look pretty decent. In past friendships, it was annoying to listen to my friends complain about their insecurities when they don’t deal with the things I deal with. The things they were insecure about, we’re so minuscule and most of the world has the same issues. It would always lower my self esteem.
Body dysmorphia has taken over my life. It’s caused insomnia for the last 3 years. I now have bags and dark circles under my eyes. My entire life, I’ve never been photogenic and hate taking pictures with friends. I constantly take pictures and videos of myself. There’s days when I look in the mirror way too much and other days where I completely avoid mirrors. It consumes my thoughts for majority of the day. I don’t want to live like this.

I have always been very active and at one point really fit  but I relapsed way too often and just couldn't bother. I got lazy and depressed very often. I still go the gym but I think it comes down to the associations with working out and getting fit as well as body image that makes it do not work for me.

I have come to the conclusion that activities that work your body and mind in a different way but is also fun works really well, preferably with others. If you like sports, join a local team in whatever team sport that excites you.

I'm not very good with most sports but I do enjoy dancing very much and is what I have been up to for the past year or so:

I mentioned that I could relate and was having similar issues, and the way everyone else just...looked at me. Looked at me with this sense of disgust, like ""How DARE you even traumatize everyone else by putting yourself in the dating pool?!"" It sort of caused me to shut up and recess into my shell for the rest of the night. It's kind of the truth, though; like, I genuinely am unable to gain confidence in my appearance because I only ever get negative feedback; I can see people wince when they look at me with an apologetic look on their face; like, I look like the EXACT type of guy who is ugly but thinks he's attractive and it makes me just really afraid to show any confidence whatsoever.",1642924838.0

Is it considered body dysmorphia if it's mainly about my voice/accent?,3,savcy0,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/savcy0/is_it_considered_body_dysmorphia_if_its_mainly/,1,"I hate a lot of things about my body, mainly my face and smile. I don't think I'm ugly per se but I look extremely goofy and stupid.

However my biggest issue is with my voice and accent. I have a heavy accent and an absolutely horrible voice neither of which suit me at all in my eyes. This hinders my social abilities as I often speak too softly or avoid speaking at all. I have a social meetup today and I'm not feeling like opening my mouth all night.

Is this body dysmorphia too or should I visit some other more specific subreddit? Thank you in advance.",1642949709.0

"Devasted. I don't know if this is bdd, and I don't know how to tell anybody any of this in real life. I'm too embarassed to tell doctors and I'm suffering secretly.",8,saq9da,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/saq9da/devasted_i_dont_know_if_this_is_bdd_and_i_dont/,1,"There's a lot of things I feel honestly, but I am particular concerned with my damn face. Im always worrying about other people looking at me and I avoid people as much as possible. I feek so f*cling hideous, like a monster. I feel as disgusted with myself as if I were dirty and smelly, something like that, as if I am never clean. I feel like these feelings also contributed to me becoming aromantic. I've always been pretty much an ace (different from aromantic) but now I totally lost all romantic attraction towards any guys. I'm too embarassed to tell anybody in real life, so I'll just say it on here: I feel so disgusting and dirty, like nobody should ever like me or even find me beautiful. If I ever found out anybody is attracted to me, I would feel like sobbing over it because I feel like they would regret having ever had feelings for me. Also, I feel like they are doing themselves a disgrace by liking me, because I truly believe I am hideous garbage. I feel that I I not worthy of being attracted towards others because I'm automatically disqualified, and I feel like I should disappear off of this planet because I don't deserve to exist. I feel like my face looks annoying and punchable and that people would be better off without me but that their lives are now ruined by me because I""m a disgusting view to look at. Its like having an expensive painting and me being the smudge that destroys it all.. I feel like people find me secretly annoying as well, specifically because of me looking ugly, which doesn't make me even likeable as a friend. I used to be called annoying by a lot of people. I remember when i was a kid and I tried playing with my mom and she got mad and said ""what's wrong with you"". I remember sobbing after that and not playing with her anymore. I also remember when I was seven years old and I was giggling by the stairs over soemthing funny my older cousin had said. Everybody was laughing and I kept gigling because I couldn't help it. Suddenly my cousin kinda ganged up on me and told me that I was exgaerrating with my laugh and my mother told me the same thing. Automatically I ran upstairs sobbing with large blouse over my head, crying underneath it while I sat in a corner, hiding by the stairs. I remember remember day believing that I was annoying and ugly. My mother is not a vile person, but her and my dad have said a lot of things that have hurt my feelings and that they enevr apologized for. I'm currently 23 and I still carry a lot of painful memories. I was also teased by a teacher when I was distressed by a significant event in my life. I feel like a lot of this contributed to low self esteem and rage. I started hating people by the time time was age 5 and it only got worst with time as people in public started bullying me for looking the way I do and calling me weird. I really never knew how to make friends because I didn't know how to socialize. Whenever I did, people found me annoying even if I didn't say anything out of the ordinary. Sometimes kids would ask me to play with them and I'd just isolate myself far away into a library. So now jumping time forward, here I I currently hating myself. I hate my voice I think it's ugly and that my laugh is ugly and like I annoy people just by talking and simply exisitng, no matter what tone I speak in, I think people just find me annoying and secretly wish me to not exist. I know I'm ugly and I'm just dislike able. If somebody wanted to stab me to death, I'd let them becaus I feel like I deserve it. And please, don't think that I""m saying that I believe other people who are deemed ""ugly"" deserve these things, I don't believe that, I just believe that about myself, that I don't deserve to live. I feel like my ugliness makes me automatically unworthy of any love or help. Sometimes I wonder what more chill friendly people I've met have thought about me. I've been told in public by different people that I look weird...and yes, i know I do I always knew it before anybody mentioned it. I'm not dumb. I just wonder if most people think of me as garbage too because they sure treat me like it. And as for some of the nice people I've met in real life I know some are naturally kind people, but I feel like some of the people who have been nice to me, are just friendly because they feel sorry for me, since they probably figure I get treated unfairly for being ugly. I saw somebody recently with beautiful blue eyes, eyes like I've never seen before. I couldn't help but to stare for a bit and I think they noticed, which then made me feel shame and embarassment. I didn't mean to stare but I accidentaly did becauss I was just in so much disbelief at how beautiful they were in comparison to ugly me..n in other words I didn't realize how ugly i was until I saw them.. Now I can't are comparing myself to them. As soon as I got home from that place, I started hating on myself and sobbing. I have slashed my face with a razor blade before because I was so upset with the way my face looks. Currently, I dont like talking to men in real life not because I have anything against them, rather because I don't want them to accidentally think that I am flirting with them or that I like them. I dont want to make them feel disgusted with themselves all because of my ugly fault. I dont want to make them think that I like them and then for them to feel like they're filthy because an ""ugly woman"" was staring at them. I get nervous though because if i avoid eye contact, then they might think I'm getting nervous because I like them, even though I'm not attracted to any of them. Hence, because there's no way if me winning, I prefer to avoid them all together in real life. This is also why I dont compliment anybody in real life either. Well, on the bright side, since I'm I'm ace now, at least they don't have to worry about me liking any of them, so they don't have to be traumatized about ugly me being attracted to beautiful them. Really at this point, just wish I was never born. I think I deserve to be thrown off of a cliff by a group of people because I know everybody is better than me. I have the rona virus right now.If I had to go to the hospital, I probably would just give up my space to somebody else because I feel like people's eyes burn by just looking at me. Besides, I don't need more teasing, I've been teased enough. If I could get cosmetic surgery, I would, but I cant because I have chronic medical conditions that affect me drastically and it can put my health at risk. I wish I could get my face to look beautiful, my body is pretty ugly, but my face is a lot uglier.  I feel like in I don't deserve to look like a woman in regards to my body, because I feel like my face looks looks manly and it just doesn't compliment my physique very well.. I feel like a disgrace, like I'm I'm shame and that my very existence dishonors other woman because im an ugly woman. I'd appreciate any tips on how to hide my face better by the way. Currently, my signature look is wearing dark sunglasses with my hair down, boring opaque clothes to blend in and not draw attention. Secretly, I hate my ethnic features too. I feel like it's part if the reason I look weird. I wish I had white skin and a rounder face. My long face is hard to hide. Often, people like me are also called dirty skinned because our elbows look patchy even if we wash them with all kinds of soaps and products. The day I die, I don't even want a funeral. I feel like I don't deserve a ceremony, like people should just burn me to ashes because every part of me should be deleted from existence. I truly feel like a mistake, ugly, horrible. And I can't help but to lately feel guilty over food. I have ocd (yes diagnosed by my doctors) and I not sure if this cam be more of a bdd thing or ocd, but I'm kinda becoming obsessed with aging and body fat. Lately, I keep feeling guilt over what I eat, like I need to eat ""clean"" (healty unprocessed) food. Eating something that isn't homemade or that has sugar will leave me feeling like a failure. I get more triggered when I look bloated and I feel like I should be getting rid of that ""fat"" part immediately. Like I said, I'm too embarassed to tell this to anyone, so I'm even more devastated because I don't know how to help myself. I'll probably get criticized for what i said, but this is raw. Everything I expressed here hurts. I was sobbing as I was writing this and I'm currently crying. I just can't stand it, I'm tired of being ugly and feeling so dirty and unworthy.",1642931676.0
Feeling strange about my body size,0,sb0p5q,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sb0p5q/feeling_strange_about_my_body_size/,1,"Hi so I feel strange about the disparity of my clothing size and my appearance. I am 5'0 and around 98 lbs and my weight has fluctuated between 92-100 in the past 1.5 years. Anytime I go above 99 lbs by even 1-2 pounds i get extremely anxious and start hating myself. I dont know why I feel that way.

I am a size 00/XXS or XS petite depending on the brand but I literally feel like i don't look it at all. I dont think I look skinny and if anything I feel pudgy and extremely insecure in revealing clothing. idk if that's in my head or what. I feel like i need to lose weight because if I don't weigh low 90s I feel like I'm huge. I feel like I don't look like other girls who are the same size as me. Idk if it's body dysmorphia or if I just have a pudgier body type. Can you be fat and fit into those sizes if you're short or am I just insane. The only time in my life that I genuinely felt thin was when i was around 80 lbs recovering from a stomach infection\~2.5 years ago. I could never get to that weight again (nor would I ever want to) and I couldn't even wear normal clothing. But that was the one and only time I felt like I wasn't chubby. Is this all in my head?

All those people will just make a stupid face and then go into a pose or make those model facial expressions. That shit does not and will not work if you're not conventionally attractive. All those people had at least one attractive feature. I have small lips, round eyes with weird eyebrows and a weird face shape that's kind of square but also kind of chubby and a big forehead. My face does not fit any beauty standard anywhere. My body is not great either. Nothing about my physically is good. I acknowledge that fitting the beauty standard isn't a must for being attractive.

Genetics Rant,8,sanbo8,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sanbo8/genetics_rant/,1,"It sucks having to think or worry about things that are not your fault but you have to deal with the consequences of. Most conventionally attractive people will never understand this feeling. I am constantly thinking about treatments, surgeries and operations that I need to have to “fix” myself. I came up with this list.
- gynecomastia surgery
- rhinoplasty (bulbous, wide nose)
- skin treatments (for acne, acne scars and aging etc)
- teeth whitening
- LASIK

I hate it that I have to consciously or subconsciously think about these things when I look in the mirror or need to get a picture taken of myself whereas many many people I know literally don’t have to think about any flaw stated above and hence can use their brain cells for other things that are useful. It truly sucks. Also, what is the deal with people who have BDD due to being fat? If the only problem I had was being fat, I would be ecstatic. It’s the only thing where behaviour plays much more role than genetics and you can behaviourally change it. Also you see progress on a monthly basis which can immensely boost your self esteem.",1642919962.0

From pretty kid to ugly adult,10,sal91t,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sal91t/from_pretty_kid_to_ugly_adult/,1,"Not sure if this belongs here but do let me know...

I was a very cute kid, had a rough patch with puberty but came out a pretty teenager but everything started going down when I hit 20 and its been 4 years since.

It hurts to just lose all that, like how the hell does that even happen!!! At first I thought maybe it was just weight, well I've lose some of it but I still look horrible and now I'm all out of ideas. 

I just become a more warped and droopy version of myself with each passing day. I'm becoming less and less symmetrical and the fat keeps coming back and settling on my face. I don't dare to go outside for fear that I'll meet someone who knew me, I've cut off contact with people who knew me when I was still pretty cos it feels like I've disappointed them. 

I stopped looking at mirrors because it will ruin my entire day, when I dress up I want to cry in public. I cannot acknowledge the person I see when I accidently glance a reflective surface so I try to deny it.

Being a pretty teen I've never experimented with makeup or skincare so I don't know anything and now it is too late and I'm only gonna ruin it even more if I do it. 

I hate the way I look so much I want to die, I want to kill myself and restart on it all and not screw up again. 

I don't even think its BDD, just a person who became ugly as an adult after an easy child/teenhood and can't cope.",1642912600.0
I attempted suicide and my doctor invalidated how I feel about my body and self-esteem.,33,sadoqa,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sadoqa/i_attempted_suicide_and_my_doctor_invalidated_how/,11,"For reference I'm really skinny and petite. I am also a black woman. Long story short, I took quite a lot of acetaminophen and caffeine at once. When I called 911 they were really alarmed and said I needed to get help quickly. I was taken to the ER immediately. Honestly, I was mostly okay, probably because I've taken a lot of Tylenol for a long period of time dealing with frequent migraines. 

The trigger? My extreme hate and disgust for my own appearance, mostly my body. 

And out of everything I dealt with yesterday, you know what was the worst part of it all? 

Feeling completely invalidated by all the professionals there, including my own (white) doctor -- yes to anyone who doesn't understand differences in cultural standards yet, the races here are VERY relevant.

After being asked if anything caused me to react so drastically I explained my struggles as best as I could.

But **OF COURSE** (if you're a fellow skinny woman who hates it you know *exactly* what I'm about to say), she cut me off as soon as I said the words ""body image issues."" She said ""Aww but you're so tiny!""

That was such a huge trigger. I started bawling immediately. I said, ""That's literally the problem!! I don't feel womanly and good enough!""

I was immediately bombarded afterwards with the age-old ""Oh my gosh but don't you like being tiny?! When you're 30 trust me you're going to wish you could go back to it! I felt like you and then I got older and my metabolism changed and..."" 

And you know what? I wish people like that would just PISS OFF! They do not understand, and these types of people particularly don't understand because they ignorantly think I fit their own eurocentric standards. The thing is I literally don't because first of all I'm *not European.*

So no, Rachel, I don't like being a black woman with a body that doesn't meet my own culture's standards, and the ""SMALL"" scrubs you give me swallowing me up like it's 4x the size and not feeling womanly enough due to the lack of curves.

And no, Michelle, I hate when you project your own insecurities onto me and try to one-up me by saying ""But so many women would *kill* to have a body like yours, you have nothing to be jealous about!"" You have a degree in medicine and you're still this ignorant? Go away. Some people just can't accept that not everyone wants to be a size 0 and honestly, that's NOT okay! Just because someone feels bad about a trait that *you* want, that doesn't give you the right to invalidate or guilt trip them.

It's not okay because when I see bigger, voluptuous, plus size or ""regular"" sized women and they voice their struggles and insecurities you know what I *don't* do? I don't immediately harp on them and say, ""Gosh but I would *kill* to have those curves, don't you know how hard it is to be compared to a prepubescent child all the time for having small breasts? It's so hard to even find anything in my size!""

Why? Because that would be wrong and I would rightfully be called out for being wrong. But the reality is that skinny women do not get that same treatment, even in a hospital with psych patients, and I'm tired of it! Insecurities are insecurities, body image and dysmorphia doesn't discriminate, so I wish people would stop acting like it does and treating these horrible feelings as a competition...",1642889877.0

My mother's insult towards my flaws (that I'm completely insecure of),24,sa8axq,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/sa8axq/my_mothers_insult_towards_my_flaws_that_im/,28,"I (21F) casually told my mother (44) that I looked at myself by the mirror the last time and that my body looks fine for my age, that I'm just really skinny and that I don't look like an adolescent child at all. My body type (ectomorph) is the biggest complex I have so I'm really insecure about it.

Then her response was so rude. It was so rude that it made me feel numb. She said ""yeah right, you're skinny, have a terrible posture and concave ass"". I am aware of those flaws and honestly they were my insecurities. So I got offended and told her ""please stop talking"". She didn't liked what I told her so she got angry out of nowhere, and told me that she was only saying the TRUTH. Then she added ""you think what I said was body shaming you!? Suck it up and learn to accept the harsh truth and criticism"". That's what she exactly said, criticism! 

I was about to defend myself and tell her that I felt offended with her words, but I just shut my mouth and ignored everything. I'm sure she's going to throw a fit if I said anything else. I'm just wondering on why my casual and healthy sentence triggered her to say something so rude in return. 

But ngl the primary source of my body dysmporphia is thanks to my dear mother (lmao). These types of comments from her were so constant so there's nothing new. What can I do? I have mild scoliosis and I can't work out properly in our small home so I'm unable to fix these ""flaws"" for now.

So now the reason for this little vent post.  I've always enjoyed thrift shopping.  The environment is so calming and was primarily older people with the exception of a few younger people like myself.  Starting last year, this began to change.  When tiktok started popularizing thrifting, I began to notice much more people my age and younger at my local thrift stores.  Now whenever I go, I can't help but feeling judged by the other girls there or worrying about my appearance and how others there percieve me.

In the process of making my dick bigger, it has led me to unknowingly overpumping using a hydro penis pump which has caused discoloration and pigmentation marks on it. It may have affected my erections as well. Unaware that I was unknowingly overpumping every time I used it and what I was exactly doing to my penis until recently, these issues have been causing me severe depression and suicidal thoughts in the past month and a half. I’ve scheduled appointments with doctors but I have to wait another month to see what’s going on. Even though I’m the ideal size according to research (6.5in length x 5 in girth), I still want a bigger one. I still want to increase my size slightly and safely using a penis pump for penile health and rigidity and a penile extender for length.

Any advice? I’m like a completely different person from before. I used to be very productive but now I’m losing the will to do anything even though no permanent damage is known yet. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a couple weeks to help me through this time.",1642883190.0

My features (especially my nose, it takes up my face really) doesn’t complement each other and I honestly feel like if I had smaller, narrow features it would make me look much better. 

Along with wishing to look like the women I named above, I wished I looked like Ashley graham, Lupita N’yongo, Jorja Smith, Natalie Portman (difference is these women have narrow features) I can go down the list of women I wished I looked like.

Humans have bad angles, and I want to be extinguished of them, but it's not possible. I want to be otherworldly, a face that will never exist. I'm exhausted. I could have the most perfect face in the world, defined by others and still hate myself so much it gnaws at my insides. Nothing ever makes me happy. Body dysmorphia destroys you. I'm constantly worrying about how I look, why I'm never perfect, not enough, too much. It doesn't matter how a person looks. Body dysmorphia kills and affects people of all sizes. It's a cycle— I wish I was someone else, obsess over a picture for days before realizing how ugly it is, and I'm afraid I'll just hate myself more if I was someone else.

But that’s not the case , I have PCOS which means I grow hair on my face and that causes acne scars that are hard to get rid of 2. PCOS makes you gain hella weight and you don’t even know how it got there you just woke up one day being overweight with a hair face , One minute I’m losing 10 pounds next minute I’m gaining it back that’s not my fault my body doesn’t have the proper ingredients in it to help me shed weight easily like the next person. That’s not my problem, 3. I’m getting older I’m damn near 30 yrs old and now it’s harder then ever to lose weight. I hate when people say back handed comments without knowing what’s really going on with someone. Not everyone looks like Beyoncé or zendaya or Jennifer Lawrence. Remember that!",1642731738.0

Sometimes I look normal, sometimes I look quite attractive. This is also the case for reflections, be it walking past a shop and seeing myself in the window or looking into the reflection of my phone when it is turned off and I'm staring at the black screen - I generally like what I see and I am content with my appearance.

However, whenever I open the front camera of my phone everything just crumbles. It's like I'm a different person and look nothing like what I see in the mirror. Even when I flip the camera to take a mirror picture it's totally different to what I'm seeing with my own eyes? It's not even taking a picture, I don't need to take it, if I see myself in the camera I just look nothing like how I do. 

I've heard about lens distortion but I always question how everyone around me is able to do it. They can take pictures and are happy with what they say, hell I can't even use facetime, look at myself in the camera app or even Snapchat or even go on video calls like on interviews cos of how disgusted I am.

I hate myself so much I feel sick, I spend hours body checking and watching tik tok compilations of fat women on YouTube to feel superior. I am so ugly, deformed. I hate my hair so much, I wish I was like the stereotypical beautiful blonde girls. I just wish I had one special or good feature on my face or body but nope. I am so boring to look at and this bothers me the most. Every single unattractive feature that people complain about or spend thousands to change? Yep I have them all. Frizzy boring brown hair, massive fat head, fat cheeks, fat body with a straight down waist, wide rib cage, sagging boobs, small lips that are uneven (confirmed by a plastic surgeon), tiny squint eyes, low brow bone that makes me look angry and manly, yellow teeth, gap teeth that even braces didn’t fix properly, man hands, ugly toes, flat arse, premature wrinkles, dark circles (confirmed by people constantly asking me if I am tired), huge labia, self harm scars, acne scars, hip dips. Always people tell me to cheer up and I’m not even sad. That’s how I know I’m ugly - my natural face is so unapproachable and angry sad tired looking. How much money would I need to fix everything? Probably Elon Musks bank account. I cant even dye or straighten my hair or wear makeup because this disorder tells me not to. ‘You’d be lying to yourself and everyone else if you did’. Cant wear nice clothes because they look wrong on my body and I don’t want to buy them until I reach my impossible goal weight / hourglass figure. I give up. I have nightmares related to bdd and I constantly look for ginger / blonde girls on social media and in real life to trigger myself.

People who think bdd is only attractive people who think they’re ugly really invalidate how debilitating this disorder actually is.,73,s83ubp,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s83ubp/people_who_think_bdd_is_only_attractive_people/,10,"I see this on subs like r/ugly a lot, I’m gonna start this off by saying you can have bdd even if your flaws may be real to a certain extent. It’s a huge issue that people think bdd should only be when it really just doesn’t exist. For example if you have a big nose and you don’t like that it’s ok, but most people can live with a big nose and be fine. The difference is if your life is being absolutely destroyed by the fact that your nose is big that’s an issue.


It saddens me because I see people who probably do have bdd feeling like it’s not possible because it’s stereotyped to only happen to pretty people who think they’re ugly. It honestly affects me too, I have a weak jaw and a big nose that’s true but I also still have bdd. it was so hard for me to realize this and seek proper treatment just because I didn’t think I was pretty enough.


Also it’s not only creating issues for people being able to seek (or even get) diagnosis. but it affects how people see this disorder from an outsiders perspective. It should be taken as an obsessive, irrational, and life ruining mental disorder. not pretty people being insecure because bdd affects everyone and I’m tired of people pretending it only applies to specific to people with good features.",1642634792.0

New here!,6,s8e8hd,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s8e8hd/new_here/,1,"Hi folks, I’m happy to be here.

I’ve had an unhealthy relationship with food and my body image for as long as I can remember. I’ve canceled plans, missed so many classes, kept myself from enjoying my favourite activities (there aren’t a lot of things I love more than water parks. But I absolutely cannot). 

I’ve had untreated anxiety, depression, breakdowns and panic attacks for about 8 years now. Ive self harmed as well, but that has been going well in the past year. My most common trigger is getting dressed.

I never purged and I don’t think I binge, so even if I knew I had troubles with food and my body, I could not call it an eating disorder. So I guessed if it’s not bad enough to be an ED, then it’s probably nothing. I must just want a problem so I can get attention. 

I knew of body dysmorphia, but only among transgender people. It did weirdly resonate with me a bit, but I knew I’m definitely cis. So I thought, once again, that I must be looking for something that would make me special or something. 

But then, on reddit, I came across a post mentioning body image issues and body dysmorphia. I found this subreddit. I’m here now. I’m valid and I can finafuckingly talk about it.

BDD first popped up for me when I turned 18 and finally lost the weight I'd had throughout my teenage years, only to be met with an ugly face I couldn't change. It felt awful and I ended up putting off my education with the goal of making myself better mentally and more attractive, cause I simply couldn't bear the thought of interacting with so many strangers on a daily basis and them seeing my face. 

This went on for about two years tbh, daily bodychecking for 4+ hours a day. I got into therapy and while it stopped me from feeling suicidal, I still felt awful. My friend group slowly began to shrink as my old friends made their own friends at uni and work while I socially isolated myself more and more. Then 2020 came around with COVID, and my father was diagnosed with cancer. This was by far the worst period of my life, and for the first time in a while I stopped caring about my appearance. Things were really rough and last year he passed. 

This did spur me into some degree of self improvement though, and I ended up completing a pathway into university and managed to get into a good course at a good uni, shredded 22kg I put on over the year my father had cancer, and I've been really excited for my future for the first time in a while. Felt as though I was finally going to put the past four years to bed and move on with my life.

But now I'm here, a month away from moving out and away for university and my BDD feels as though it's the worst its ever been. The past month I've been doing nothing but constantly checking and criticising my appearance, the past week I've spent upwards of 8 hours a day looking in the mirror or taking selfies. I feel so ugly and disgusting to the point I'm considering deferring uni and putting my life on hold again. Everything feels wrong and distant, I feel as though there's no hope of me recovering a social life and the possibility of ever having a significant other is feeling like an impossibility. All because of my appearance. I just hate that I have to deal with this and that I'll likely never be free from it. I've never felt super suicidal before but the thoughts do creep in when it gets really bad, and honestly its felt bad pretty constantly the past few weeks.

idk why I'm posting this, probably because it feels like I've reached my absolute breaking point with it. I just want a normal life and hate that the only thing keeping me from it is my own self hatred.",1642658774.0

Compliments like ""you're so handsome"" ""you're so good looking"" ""there's nothing wrong with your face"", and I thought maybe despite the evidence to the contrary: Grimacing faces, no love-life, shod off into the outcast groups during school, friendly notices from people saying I was ugly or look like kylo ren from star wars or my nose is off. ""You're beautiful, just not enough for me. At all.""

&#x200B;

I feel as though I've hit a stone wall with no hope at advancing. The price point on making any improvements will require support, but all the ""you're handsome"" and ""there's nothing wrong with you"" ends acts as resistance towards that goal. Rated a 5/10 by one person and told I'm ""very cute, the nose works with ur face"" by another. Conflicting voices, external to go with the internal. Mom is so fervent at supporting me that I'm beautiful she derails be that I have body dysmorphia ""There's nothing wrong with your nose son."" Dad mocking me after not seeing me for years, ""look at you now."" Telling me not to be so bitter and angry to get the chip off my shoulder. I wondered what he meant when I wasn't angry, but now that I'm angry about my appearance evaluated by a society who give me less than what I think I deserve (When I've been told I'm handsome and believed it, through all the evidence to the contrary).

Is it a corrupted system that seeks to keep me on the bottom of the totem pole so that I don't advance. The pretty stay pretty and ugly stay ugly. Its more ordered that way.

This mask fishing thing is making my bdd worse,61,s733wy,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s733wy/this_mask_fishing_thing_is_making_my_bdd_worse/,8,"When we were first required to wear masks, I felt a bit of comfort knowing that I wouldn't have to have my entire face out whenever I went out of the house. A lot of people have also told me that I have nice eyes, so I was kinda happy about the only decent feature that I have being the only feature that people will be able to see anytime I go out. A few weeks ago though, I found about mask fishing, and now it's making my bdd worse. Somehow, I feel like I'm being a fake by wearing a mask, so everytime I have to eat, I feel so disgusting because I would have to take my mask off and people would see the entirety of my face which is reallllly ugly. Idk, it somehow just feels worse than when I didn't have to put a mask on because now I feel like i set up an expectation that's ultimately going to be broken down when I have to take my mask off, whereas there were no expectations before when we didn't have to wear masks since there are no expectations set. It is clear from that start that this is my face. Not to mention that my bdd has gotten worse since the pandemic started because I'm no longer used to going out and dealing with the feeling that I'm being judged because of my disgusting appearance.

I’m 20F (almost 21) and I’m not sure if I do have BDD, but I think I might. I have ADHD and my whole life I have fluctuated weight, but it got really bad in my pre teens and teens (up until maybe 15-16) where I weighed 100kg (220lb - to add I’m also 176-179cm or approx 5ft 8/9). Then I started taking meds and I lost so much weight - I went from 100kg to my lowest (in a long time, I’m sure I was lower when I was younger) to 50kg (110lb). Every now and then I don’t take my meds (usually only for a day or two, depends on why I’m not taking it) and I binge eat (due to my ADHD, which is why I was so big in the first place) so I constantly gain weight and lose weight. I’m left now (at 62kg/136 lb) with loose, jiggly fat and stretch marks. A lot of stretch marks which are absolutely everywhere. It’s not only my weight, but I’m also quite hairy and I’m fair (very fair) and dark hair so it’s very obvious. 

There are some days where I look in the mirror and I feel good about myself (not perfect, but I can be like - I look beautiful or I don’t look that bad) but some days…I’d rather KMS than be “this fat”. I have people (usually my gran but even teachers back at school) ask if I’m okay or if I eat (the lady is from my gran) which bothers me, because to me, I’m absolutely huge with a ton of saggy, jiggly skin and cellulite. It’s not even in mirrors or when I look down at my stomach but in photos too. I’m sure Im not as bad as what I think, but to me, when I look at photos or myself in the mirror (usually without clothes on) I feel disgusted. 

Sometimes, if I notice clothes sit funny (usually around my butt or thighs/crotch), I’ll say to my mum “I need to change” or if I mention the issue, she’ll say “ugh you look fine”, “I wish I was ‘your fat’”, or “nobody will be looking”, but I think everyone’s looking at that specific spot. Sometimes, I think I might see it as worse than what it is, but it gets to me a lot. 

Idk, how do you guys deal?

Edit: along with ADHD and similar disorders, I also have social anxiety and depression.

The days I do feel like going out I try conceal my marks, but im a man and not very experienced in the makeup department.

"BDD is understandable, because looks are very hard to gage",49,s6voze,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s6voze/bdd_is_understandable_because_looks_are_very_hard/,5,"There are so many different ways lighting can affect the way someone looks at a given moment. There are so many different angles that you can overly focus on instead of others. Your face can change in appearance throughout the day slightly due to puffiness caused by when we woke up, allergies, or if we ate too much salt. The way we dress or style ourselves also has a huge factor in how looks are perceived too.


In addition to that, the way looks are perceived is influenced by how your personality is perceived; there's many times where someone we perceive someone initially as not attractive but as we get to know them our perception changes, and obviously that happens the other way round too. If someone is very anxious and lacks confidence in the way they look, we're probably less likely to appreciate their appearance fully: so its very easy to create a cyclical effect, of someone feeling ugly gathering more evidence that supports that belief, because feeling ugly and anxious can affect the way other people perceive you. 

Because of all these factors, the way we look is really hard to determine objectively, and is really easily manipulated by subconscious biases that we have. I think us people with body dysmorphic disorder have developed this physical habit of ' feeling ugly ' over time, and that feeling can really manipulate our interpretation of the data that we use to make judgements about ourselves; We might instinctively compare our reflection or picture taken in poor lighting with how someone else might look in better lighting, we might overly focus on angles or features that nobody else really cares about, we might dismiss or overlook other unattractive traits of other people, or we might compare the way we look when we're at home in our bedrooms to how people look when they've gotten ready to appear in public.

TL;DR: I guess the summary point is, our subconscious feelings can very easily gather up enough evidence to rationalise the way they feel, because the data we interpret to determine our looks are so easily influenced and skewed by our biases.

I understand acknowledging this doesn't cure these subconscious biases, but I think it can help in forming the habit of trusting these feelings a little less in the meantime.

I hope this reminder can help somebody.",1642506369.0

Any advise on how to live with my body? How to find help?

He gains weight quickly and has a more compact body type. So I ended up doing diets to prevent me from becoming fat when I was 13. I was really proud to have a super low BMI and trained myself to overcome the feeling of hunger by cutting my meals in half when the first signs of curves appeared.
I couldn't stop gaining weight when I was twenty and my hashimoto hit along with depression. The people around me are telling me that I don't look fat and my first therapist even refused to believe how high my weight is. For me it all sounded like a joke, they are all making fun of me,how could they not see this? 
When I look in the mirror I see a stranger, I see the persons my mum showed me as a negative example when I was a kid. I see someone I was trained to hate and to see with disgust my whole childhood. 

Now I'm 28 and I am hopeless. I had several therapists who all told me to just loose weight, assuming that I binge eat a lot of sweets because I already cut my calorie intake to a minimum and it didn't help. I had doctors telling me that I should loose weight if it's a problem for me, but whenever I ask for help or medication they alway end up sending me to a diet course where I gain weight because my metabolism clearly isn't working normal. Then they are assuming that I binge eat again and so on. And everytime how I see my body gets worse. I can't look in the mirror, I used to do lots of sports but now my anxiety and depression is so bad that it feels like torture.

I've always struggled with this and it's severely took it's toll on my mental health. I've had some terrible experiences because of it and seen how cruel people can be many times. My confidence and self esteem are non existent. I feel so defective, inferior and ashamed of myself. I despise my body completely. Even though I can't help how it is and have no control over it; I still can't help but put all the hate and blame on myself.

Now I've been mocked, laughed at, belittled, rejected, hurt and insulted for my size before. It took me such a long time to build up the confidence to even talk to anyone, trusting someone with something so intimate felt impossible. I found a glimmer of hope and built up my confidence, everything seemed good and I finally felt love. That's until she found out that I'm small. It's like I wasn't even the same person to her, like all my humanity disappeared in her eyes.

I was tossed away like garbage as per usual, this I'm used to. Being told I should kill myself all because the size of something I didn't choose?

I don't know if the title makes any sense, but I'm so sick of this ""healing process"".

I go to therapy, I'm doing the BDD workbook, I removed reflective surfaces from my room, I don't freeze at the sight of the camera anymore, I eat well (most of the time), but I still relapse. I still battle with intrusive thoughts and the constant nagging from the back of my head telling me I'm too unattractive to be alive.

I've made progress, but it just doesn't feel like it's enough.

On a conscious-level, I know that BDD is absurd. I know that most of the time I'm just projecting my own negative views of myself onto people. I know that starving myself will only lead to a less desirable body. I know that when I'm 80 and looking for pictures of my happiest memories I'll be so disappointed to not find anything because I was too insecure to have my picture taken. I know all of this, or at least I tell myself that I believe it.

And yet the grasp BDD has on me doesn't budge. My intrusive thoughts never go away. My self-harm tendencies never look less desirable.

I don't know what I'm expected to do. And seeing my mother, a 50 something yearold still starve herself, poke at her body, and comment on others' worries me that this might be a burden that I'll have to carry for the rest of my life.

It is so debilitating and draining. It has set me off course so many times. I almost flunked out of university because I was too busy stalking beautiful girls and crying over not having big enough boobs & cheeks.

Sometimes I feel so conceited for caring so much about my appearance. But I just can't help it. And I don't know if my life's ever going to be manageable with this disorder.",1642490480.0

My whole life my weight averaged around 160, but I am a “fluctuater”. I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease when I was around 18yrs old, and got up to 210lb. I got on some meds and got my health under control, and dropped back down to 160. I got put on another medication for my disease recently which made me lose 30-33 pounds in 3 months. I’m now 128-130lb, and this is the smallest I’ve ever been. According to my BMI (which I heard is BS anyways), I’m in my healthy weight range. I felt good when I lost the weight, my legs and hips slimmed down which was an insecurity of mine due to random strangers sexualizing me during my day to day life. I also felt pretty good at 150-160, I didn’t have too many problems with my self image. My joy from my recent weight loss is getting crushed my constant comments from friends and mainly family. “You’ve never looked this good.”, “Your arms are so skinny, are you eating?”, “Are you sure you are eating 3 meals a day?”, “Where did your (chest area) go?”, “Everyone look at her, didn’t she lose weight?”, “Did you get prescribed Adderall or something?”, “I want whatever you are taking.” And just more comments of my body parts slimming down. It’s just annoying that everyone is bringing it up, I don’t want attention from anyone. “You’ve never looked this good” stung because are you implying I didn’t look good before? And no, I am not on adderall. No, you don’t want what I’m taking because It’s a medication to help my blood sugar levels. And yes, I eat 2-3 meals a day. I know losing weight is a struggle for many many people. When I was 210, I tried EVERYTHING and for years and no weight loss. I feel almost guilty for even complaining about my weight loss journey, but I wasn’t aware that everyone in my life would take such an interest in it. Are the comments I received not nice? I’m not sure if I am overreacting or not. I’ve struggled with my family commenting on my looks since I was a kid so I am a bit sensitive when they make additional comments.

For a year now I have been in love with him but I’m believing I am one of many guys he talks to . He’s always attentive to my conversations , more than any guy I’ve talked to . Yet I feel as if it is his charm that he uses on all guys. I also have horrible body dysmorphia and every picture he has seen of me has been taken to make myself look the best way possible. I have come to acceptance deep within me that I will never have him , two reasons, my unattractive features and his constant interest in men.

As much as I’ve loved him I’ve also wanted to be him at multiple stages of my life since I’ve met him. We’ve had plentiful conversations about fashion and in my spare time I play “Blue Monday” by New Order imagining I am a famous designer or up and coming model . I have been infatuated with fashion for a while and it is sort of a fantasy I have of being within the tight fashion circles and looking my absolute best.

I have now become numbingly and deeply depressed with this whole string of events . I’ve spent the past few days waking up and remembering how much more successful he will be and how subordinate and inferior I am. I don’t see myself going anywhere within my life .

Plastic surgery BDD hell,9,s5ldeh,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s5ldeh/plastic_surgery_bdd_hell/,3,"Trigger warning : plastic surgery, fat-phobia and BDD and a really f**ing long post

43F, BDD as far as I can remember

For the last few years I have these rituals that keep me functional : Botox, fillers, shapewear, dieting, makeup and clothe. As much time and money as these consume, my daily, monthly, yearly rituals seem to work, at least somewhat, I go to work, socialize and most of the time I feel okay in public. I have this weird thing where as long as I can hide everything, I can function.

For years I’ve had deflated implants,i knew I had to change them but waited until I stopped having children to do so. I’d been thinking about plastic surgery for a long time, and finally decided to do it. I decided for a full mommy makeover, while I was at it.

I had surgery on October 1st, 7 surgeries at once. I thought this would finally free me from daily shapewear and the shame surrounding my breasts. 
I had arm and backlift, breast lift with implants, tummy tuck, lipo 360 and BBL. 

Upon waking up, I was really happy with my results, felt a huge relief. A few days in I realized how big my butt was, dear lord! No one told me they put double the fat needed to shape and this fat is absorbed progressively until the butt reaches its final shape.

I had surgery out of the country and was crying for most of my trip until my return. It was Enormous, like I mean huge, couldn’t fit in my extra large sweat pants! The doctors told me it would shrink with time, but my brain just couldn’t cope with the question of how much ? 

Note : I hate being fat, anything fat on me, it just freaks me out and I’ve never had issues with my butt, it’s never bothered me, I added the surgery thinking I might as well get a full body makeover, while I’m at it, I ask for reshaping, not bigger. 

It’s been 3,5 months since the surgery and my butt has shrunk a lot, but it’s still big. The first few weeks after my return I kept telling myself to wait it out, to trust the process that it would get smaller in time.

In some pictures, when I’m naked or in underwear, it looks great, my waist looks tiny and it’s round and all and then I tell myself it will be fine. but when I get dressed, nothing looks good and I just look fat. 

Some days are okay but when the night comes, I get major anxiety attacks (sometimes during the day as well) and all I see is this giant, wiggly thing on my backside. I’ve been mostly depressed ever since and don’t sleep well. I feel gross, disgusting and SUPER GUILTY for putting myself through this for no f**ing reason, this surgery was absolutely avoidable.

My BDD, which felt manageable, is now overwhelming. I feel like I’m living with a constant death threat is looming over me and I’m regularly overwhelmed with dread. The whole surgery has been a difficult experience as the body gets swollen, scarred and bruised, the results are never guaranteed and everything keeps on changing. The answer to anxiety is an answer, here there is no answer yet, and time has stood still. 

I am not in an emotional, financial, psychological state where I want to put myself through this again but if this state of distress keeps going, I will have no choice but to do something about it. I feel completely trapped. I cannot hide my butt with clothe. It’s just out there for everyone to see. 

I feel lonely and have isolated myself. I tried to reach out to loved ones no one can and no one does understand me as they can’t relate with BDD. 

I’m not sure anyone can read through something this long but I really need to talk about it.",1642366595.0

I’m completely aware that people have preferences and no matter how conventionally attractive someone is, not everyone is going to like them. So why do I still feel this way? It’s an impossible situation and I’ve never shared this with anyone because it seems silly and irrational.

But many people recover from BDD or learn to reduce the symptoms to the point where they don't play a role in their everyday life. Remember that a mental disorder is not a life long sentence but rather something that can be managed and recovered from.

Here we have collected a set of stories and advice on what recovery looks like and how others have gotten there.

It draws attention to everything I hate about myself and it’s killed my productivity for today. The sad thing is I thought it looked really good before I washed it. I actually felt confident for once.

Basically my face is too wide, the upper half of my skull tapers in and just make my face look even fatter. I am not fat by any means. I don’t think anything I do will ever change how my face looks. I keep hoping I could tone my face muscles or something but I think my only option is getting the right hairstyle.

I’ve been told I’m ugly my whole life. I went through phases where I believed their words and phases where I didn’t. I kept telling myself these people were just trying to be cruel and I was at least normal looking.

But evidence has suggested otherwise. I’ve tried multiple dating apps and almost never get matches. Anyone I match with quickly loses interest. I’ve started to really hate how I look again and blame a lot of problems in my life on being ugly. People aren’t nice to me. They never go out of their way to talk to me or help me with anything. I can’t stand seeing myself in pictures and the mirror is my archnemesis. 

People close to me assure me I look fine but I don’t believe them. Would they really tell me if I was disgusting? All I see when I look at myself are flaws. I even asked a few people if they could set me up with anyone but I know they won’t bother. They know I’m too ugly to be set up with anyone.

Then I got a notification I was tagged in a post. It was my friends and I at dinner a couple hours before. I was hesitant to look but when I looked all I saw was this monster. My face is all deformed and bloated. My teeth are huge and make me look ridiculous when I smile. I was discouraged but was planning to go out anyways.

But what caused me to shut down completely was seeing one of my friend’s tiktok they made before going out. We were going to a ski lodge party, so they were dressed in really cute ski lodge themed outfits. They looked so thin and cute. I looked at myself in the mirror and I was nearly spilling out of my jeans. My chest is bigger so I felt huge in my top. I have broader shoulders so I just looked so masculine and unattractive. My outfit also wasn’t nearly as cute and I looked ridiculous. As soon as I saw the tiktok I canceled going out.

I've got no idea how it's going to go but I feel like it's just going to be someone telling me I'm not ugly, and that my ""flaws are not as bad as I think they are"" or something. This won't help me, I'll never be able to truly see myself as attractive or even normal. I will always see myself as ugly because I am ugly - you can't convince an ugly person that they are not ugly. I will always know the truth about my appearance and no one, no matter what they tell me, will be able to convince me otherwise. 

Honestly, if the therapy doesn't work, I'd consider ending my life - I don't want to be unhappy like this anymore. I don't deserve to walk this earth nor do I deserve any form of relationship. I am by definition unlovable.

How Am I Supposed to Live Like This,9,s4f516,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s4f516/how_am_i_supposed_to_live_like_this/,1,"I want to die. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. It’s bad all the time and then I have episodes where it’s worse than that. Ig that’s kinda how I feel rn. This past week and especially rn it’s been really bad (tho it’s not at the worst it’s ever been).  It’s just so painful and heavy in my body

When I look in the mirror, I stand on the corner where there’s a lightbulb missing so it casts a certain shadow on my face, I tilt my head up (maybe a bit sideways), then pull my eyes up (bc they r droopy with negative canthal tilt), all to see what I might look like with surgery. The way my hair sits affects it as well. Sometimes it gives me hope because I think “ok this looks good, if I can get surgery to look like this I’ll be ok”. But a lot of times I still look ugly. My hair impacts this again like I said (for ex. If it’s covering my face, tucked behind my ear, behind my back, in a bun, a little volume at the top, flat, etc). And there starts the cycle everyday. Back and forth and back and forth to the bathroom mirror to contort my face. I rarely look at my face when I’m not contorting it to try and relieve myself by seeing what plastic surgery might look like. I don’t want to see my face. It’s so ugly it makes me feel sick, gross and hopeless.

On top of that, I ofc don’t even bother trying to check how I look with pictures or video because I am literally too scared. I’m too nervous to look at my own picture/video because it makes me so sick. It has sent me into some of the worst spirals. 

I don’t bother with makeup. It makes me feel worse because I’m failing. 

It’s hard to take care of myself.

Plastic surgery is my only hope. But it’s hard to keep holding out hope on it. The possibility is so far away it doesn’t feel tangible. I wish I just knew for a fact that it would be able to make me prettier. I wish I knew exactly what procedures to get to enhance my features and fix my flaws and have the best version of my face possible. Like an analysis. I wish I knew what result I can achieve and what is possible. And i wish I knew who to go to. Then I think i could relax and just focus on finishing my associates degree, getting a job and saving up. But I don’t have the answers to those questions. I need to do more research and try to figure out what exactly about my face would enhance femininity, harmony, attractiveness, etc. But it’s hard, especially since I have trouble seeing objectively. And I can’t get a consultation at this time. So I just ruminate, obsess, get nervous, anxious, depressed and spend all day looking at different procedures, glow up subreddits, YouTube videos like Lorry Hill, etc.

Sometimes i feel starving myself is all I have control over. I’m a failure at that too. Self harm (burning myself) sometimes makes me feel better. I wanna hurt myself. I hate this girl. It’s only short term relief tho.

I just want hope. I just wanna know that it’ll be ok. I want peace. I’m so tired and drained. I wanna love myself. I wanna love who I see when I look in the mirror. I want to be desired and wanted and I want to believe it. I wanna not have this be on my mind 24/7. I want my best to actually be good and not just less painful than usual. I don’t wanna just get by. I wanna be happy. I wanna compliment people and not think that they would be disgusted to be complimented by me. I want to flirt and I want to know the other person wants me to and isn’t repulsed. I wanna be loved. 

I’ve isolated myself so much because of this and social anxiety. I’ve lost so much time and I’m still losing time. I feel like I’m dead. I’ve never dated or even talked to anyone. I haven’t had friends since middle schooI. All because of bdd and social anxiety. I’ve even isolated myself from loved ones. I regret all the time I’ve missed out with my family. 

I don’t have any hobbies either. I’m too depressed. I just can’t be bothered. Nothing is even that enjoyable. And my looks are always on my mind no matter what.

I feel like bdd, social anxiety, and depression have ruined my life. It’s been a slow downward hill since I was a pretty young kid. I feel like a ghost.

 Sorry, this all extremely whiny and self loathing. I just need to let it out for the millionth time. I feel like I’ve posted and commented on this subreddit an ungodly amount. I just feel like I’m stuck in a loop cuz all I can do right now is vent. I can’t have therapy or surgery right now so I’m just venting about the same things over and over. I just feel so trapped. I just wanna get out. It’s painful. I just wanna die honestly.",1642232794.0

My brother in law and sister told me to eat more.,3,s4ehaw,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s4ehaw/my_brother_in_law_and_sister_told_me_to_eat_more/,0,"I (30F) have had an unhealthy relationship with food and my body for the past 7 years. I have always been a small girl but my weight does fluctuate, it especially did a few years ago. I have been exercising regularly for the past 4 years and I’ve never been fitter than I am right now. I have acknowledged that I have a problem with fixating on what I eat and what my body looks like - sometimes I would binge badly and then not really eat the next day etc. It’s something I have really been working on, because I know I look great (I don’t mean that in a vain way, I work hard for my body) and that it’s not healthy to fixate on my weight. For the past 6 months or so, I feel I have developed a much healthier lifestyle and relationship with food and my body - I feel I’ve never looked better, felt stronger and eaten better. I am not under eating anymore and I more often than not indulge in all the yummy treats. Anyways, two days ago my husband came home (he works with my brother in law) and told me my brother in law is worried I am not eating enough. This confused me because of all the progress I have made, so I kinda laughed it off and ignored it. The next day I saw my sister and the first thing she said to me was I need to eat more. I snapped at her (which I feel terrible about) and then explained why I was being defensive, because I am really proud and happy with my lifestyle and the positive progress I have made. She proceeded to tell me that I’ve lost definition in my legs and that I’m not eating enough for how much I’m exercising (she never actually asked me how much I am really eating, as well as how much exercise I am doing.) She told me for how much I am working out, I should have more muscle and look stronger (I have a petite build and it’s difficult for me to pick up muscle.) I found the whole conversation very triggering and I felt attacked. If I had this same conversation a year ago, I would have been so down, gone home and worked out non stop in a very unhealthy way. Luckily I have progressed and I am trying not to let it get to me, but I still feel angry and very confused where this is coming from. Two weeks ago we were all together by the pool and my sister actually said to me ‘you almost have a solid six pack, your abs look great! I wish I had your bum - it reminds me that I need to start squatting.’ I am just so confused. Am I overreacting? Am I right by feeling this conversation is triggering? I never asked for their opinions or for my body to be scrutinized. My brother in law is an opinionated prick who is excellent at brainwashing and manipulating my sister to think just like him - and he loves to scrutinize women’s bodies. With knowing that, I can’t help but feel this is just him again on a random negative rampage and I am the victim. He is a very negative person who only enjoys conversations that revolve around talking shit about people. Thoughts? Advice? Am I being overly sensitive? I definitely think/know I am sensitive regarding  this topic - but everyone else around me has been telling me I look great. I just don’t know what to think. 

Ps I am so sorry for this is so long

Pss I asked my husband about their thoughts, he says they are wrong and not to listen to them.",1642230161.0

Expecting to wear makeup made my symptoms worse,13,s44kvl,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s44kvl/expecting_to_wear_makeup_made_my_symptoms_worse/,0,"I ABSOLUTELY hate it. Back when i was in 10th grade, we were told to fix ourselves (brush our hair and fix our uniforms) before our picture taking for our moving up ceremony. They told us that some ladies would be putting our makeup, and that it's mandatory. I voiced out my opinion that i don't want to get my makeup done because i don't like the way it feels on my face, and that i look DISGUSTING with it. The teachers told me that i have no choice and that the girls SHOULD get their makeup done. I said ""why is makeup mandatory?"" And the teachers said it was so our faces doesn't look oily in the picture. They also said that if i didn't get my makeup done, i wouldn't move up a grade. So i had no choice.


The women who did our makeups did SO HORRIBLE. They had ONE, LITERALLY ONE, shade of foundation FOR EVERY. SINGLE. GIRL. in our school. Im not exagerrating here. They did our makeups like clowns. Our blush was literally shaped like a circle. We had blue or green eyeshadow that wasn't blended perfectly that didn't compliment most of the girls' skin color. The lipstick choices we have are two colors: bubblegum pink or bloody red. It's ridiculous. The girls who brought their own makeup can do their own, but to those who didn't, well... we're stuck with them. After my makeup was done, everyone looked at me as if i was the joker (can't blame them, i probably looked like the joker). They were making remarks like ""why do you look like that?"" Or ""what happened to your face?"" . Those who weren't making remarks was obviously insulting me inside their head. I can barely lift my head up and look at people's faces that day. I also found it SUPER HARD to remove the makeup after, because no one brought a makeup remover, so i was forced to completely scrub my face as hard as i can with water and tissue. I almost cried that day. I can NEVER forget that experience. 


Now whenever they send our class pics in our groupchat, i ALWAYS cover my screen whenever my picture comes up. I picked up my diploma last year and i hid it before anyone in my family sees it. Instead of being proud with my moving up picture like everyone else, im basically forced to hide it from everyone. My family doesn't know i already picked up my diploma. Im planning on destroying the pictures, but ill of course keep the diploma. If i cant destroy it, ill probably hide it somewhere no one can find it. Not even myself, so i wont even have the mistake of looking at it. 


P.S. im not against makeup at all. I admire women who are grea at doing their makeup, but it's not just for me. I don't liek it on my face. And i HATE it how im EXPECTED to wear makeup to formal occasions (good thing i never attended school parties and proms), or sometimes eve semi-formal occasions. If i don't put makeup, people shame me for ""not being put together"". This is so tiring.",1642199530.0

I want to get back in touch with the person I once was + the impact of weight loss comments.,5,s42bos,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s42bos/i_want_to_get_back_in_touch_with_the_person_i/,0,"\[TW: Weight Loss + Comments\]

Reposted because of edits to stay in line with community rules! Three years ago, physically, I wasn't exactly the picture of health and perfection. But I was SO mentally sound and fulfilled personally. I got up in the morning, got dressed, did a minimal routine, and stepped into the sunshine to enjoy the day. I went on road trips and hikes ALL the time! I snapped pictures of beautiful landscapes, animals, and plants and filled my social media with them because I loved these things so dearly. I carried field guides and made a list of animals I hoped to see in parks I visited. I hiked in beautiful places with true happiness in my heart, and authentically lived in the moment and took in my surroundings. I rarely, if EVER, dwelled on my appearance or outfit or hair or makeup or skin. I felt little to no insecurity and I practically never thought about others' opinions of my looks.

I think a lot of my current issues began with a drastic weight loss over about an 8 month period. I switched to non-hormonal birth control due to unwanted heart palpitations and started eating healthily and working out and really changed my habits in a healthy mindset. I didn't even initially notice the weight loss, which ultimately amounted to 40-50 lbs. It just happened and I carried on not thinking of it. Then the comments came. First, it was people telling me I'd been losing weight and that I looked great. Okay, fine. The few comments I could deal with and it was even kind of nice and positive. Then it became the focus of every interaction with people I hadn't seen in a while. It turned into asking me what I had been doing to lose weight, what diet was I on, etc. It got everyone in the room talking. I became uncomfortable. Then some of it even turned negative - people telling me I was too skinny, my sibling and parent discussing amongst themselves that they ""hoped I didn't have anorexia."" This really cut deeply. I hated having these conversations. It came to a head when my other parent, at a family gathering, announced that I had lost so much weight and that I looked great. I know they didn't mean it negatively, but I was so sick of hearing it and it was really mentally taking a huge toll on me. I really disliked this new feeling of constantly being boiled down to my looks and weight.

Cut to now, and it has become an obsession. I am constantly worried about my appearance and body, where I NEVER have been this worried about it before. I am so deeply saddened by this. In all of my worrying and fixating, I have lost touch with so many of my passions. I haven't been camping in years. I haven't gone on even a fraction of the hikes and trips I used to. I have a hard time living in the moment and taking joy in the little things that used to put a huge smile on my face, like birds and animals and green plants and rain. I've been seeing this same woodpecker on walks lately and I really love seeing him and look forward to seeing him on my walks. It feels like that simple joy is being stirred in me again. I want that person I was a few years ago back SO badly. I want to get back in touch with my simple passions and stop caring about my face and my body and my clothing. I want to stop fixating and I don't want to hear anything about my weight ever again.",1642193595.0
How To Go About Finding What Plastic Surgery To Get,3,s45zxt,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s45zxt/how_to_go_about_finding_what_plastic_surgery_to/,1,"Hi, does anyone have advice on how to find what surgeries are right for you?

I'm dysmorphic in a way that makes me feel like a bad person,3,s44sze,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s44sze/im_dysmorphic_in_a_way_that_makes_me_feel_like_a/,2,"Just to get some context out of the way, I'm 27 years old and a trans guy, so I have dysphoria relating to my assigned gender at birth, and that's separate from what this post is about.

And onto the post.

I'm very white, and it makes me want to punch the glass when I look in the mirror. Pale skin, blonde hair, blue eyes, big blocky nose, I hate it all.

How would I prefer to look, then? Answering 100% honestly, Asian. And that's where the problem lies. It's just so racist, and it makes me feel terrible. I don't want to reduce a whole population of humanity down to their looks/aesthetic since that's ignoring a lot of problems. Logically I know there's no good reason to feel like this, genetics just made me this way and there's nothing wrong with that, but when has logic solved anything emotional?

This isn't a new thing, I've felt this way ever since I was a kid, though it was a lot less prevalent then, and I didn't really have a way to describe it. (Gender dysphoria too, but not the topic)

I have a few theories on why I feel this way: 

1) Blonde hair, blue eyes? When was *that* considered the pinnacle of humanity, and that everything else was lesser? It makes me feel disgusting that it's on me.

2) My parents are/were abusive and awful. They're hurting from their own childhoods, so they took it out on their kids. Generational curses n' all that. I'm the oldest, so I feel I got the brunt of it. I really look like I'm their kid, and I desperately want to get away from that. This dysmorphia feels like a way to cut another tie I have with my parents, even if it's purely emotional.

3) There's the politics they raised me with, but I'm gonna not go into a lot of detail on that. The long and short of it is white supremacy, which makes it tie into the first point. I've since broken myself out of their toxic thinking, but now I see myself and am reminded so heavily of that ideology.

I don't know how to mitigate this feeling. I could technically get hair dye and contact lenses and self tanner and/or whatever else, but it doesn't solve anything. The dye and tanner will eventually fade, my hair will grow out, I can take out the lenses, on and on. At the end of the day, I'm still very white. All that really changed was the money in my bank account, and I don't have a lot of that to spare.

Not to mention the whole cultural appropriation thing. I do not want to pull an Ariana Grande.

It's so hard to look for help on this sorta thing due to the nature of the problem. It's perfectly justified, I know that, but I'm at the point where I want to rip my hair out. I have found no solutions and I'm scared it's gonna get worse.",1642200143.0

You are completely powerless and helpless in any date or relationship with someone more attractive and this will never change. Whereas when you date someone who is perceived as just as ugly by society (if that exists in your case), you are both equally powerless so the relationship is healthy in terms of equality but big chance that you won’t find that person attractive either and that person is also just settling for you.

So I am trying to find creative ways to make something useful out of these problems. I'm hoping I can use them to make myself better for all of the people around me.

I am trying SO hard to understand that if I have this much pain, there must be so many other people out there who are hurting as well. Therefore I want to have more compassion for others, be more patient, have more humility, and be nicer to other people.

And when I'm tired, or frustrated, or angry with other people, I'm trying to use my own struggles to motivate me to continue my efforts to be better for those around me.

Perhaps my BDD and depression can turn into a good thing. Maybe they can help me be a better - and nicer - person. I'm going to give it a shot.

he just stopped talking to me and interacting with me in absolutely any way. for a few days I was just confused and insulted, then I find out he's been spending time over that time with another girl - who is an actual model.

admittedly, I can look at this (and am looking at this) from the perspective that he's just a total sleazebag (I'd use far worse terms, but can't because of the no derogatory language rule). as well as the hurt and rage I honestly just feel bad for this girl, too - I know barely a thing about her, but I know for a fact she can do far better than someone with an evidently gutter-rat personality like him.

but, obviously, because of my BDD, I can't help but feel like total cr\*p because of the stark physical contrast between her and I. honestly I feel like anybody would be hurt, even if they didn't have BDD. it would have been triggered badly even if she was just an ordinary looking person (hell, even they're all better looking than me) but she's literally one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen.

what makes this whole thing even sadder is that he's the first guy I've liked and trusted since I was traumatised by some guys in my teens (I've been in therapy and stuff) - the fact he wanted me (or acted like he did lmao) even started making my BDD feel a little better - and all of that progress has been swept out from under my feet.

he was just thinking out loud, not trying to offend me at all, which made it worse.

it made me really sad so i text my boyfriend of 2 yrs and told him what happened. he responded 'Ahh.. I dont really know what to say...' i told him it just confirms that im ugly. he then replied 'well you can always find a prettier girl but not one with an amazing personality like you and thats why I love you:)' I called him and told him that comment really hurt and does he really not think im pretty? He said he does think im pretty but he sees prettier girls all the time, he just doesnt care when he sees them because he loves me. Thats a funny way to tell me that im hideous lmao

I told my mum about it and she said 'you just have to accept that some people are prettier than you. some people are just lucky like angelina jolie. at least youre not super ugly. dont let your looks define you'

Even in friendships I was always deemed the ugly friend of the group , Guys never noticed me they overlooked me as if I was invisible or something.

Friend has a crush on me and it's extremely suspicious and my BDD makes their compliments uncomfortable,6,s3h0gs,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s3h0gs/friend_has_a_crush_on_me_and_its_extremely/,0,"So I met a new friend who seems to like me a lot. And when I mean seems, I mean like they have openly admitted they would be in a relationship with me. I'm kind of uncomfortable, but my girlfriend doesn't mind because she's polyamorous at heart (I'm monogamous at heart though, I find it just impossible to fall in love with someone else while dating my girlfriend).

It's like, they're so nice. They validate my fears in a realistic way. They compliment my voice and my eyes and are specific about what they like about me. They know that I'm like 5 ft tall and they know that I have tiny hands and they know about how I'm losing hair and they like, call me handsome n shit? Whenever they get too flirty I just change the subject.

I don't know it just feels so suspicious. Like with my girlfriend it makes sense because when I first started dating her I was kind of attractive, and then over time I kind of became uglier. But because she already likes my personality, it makes sense that she'd want to stay with me. It's like, when you're with someone for a long time they because physically attractive to you no matter what,, and I find that really romantic. Like telling me I'm handsome, I blush because I know it's coming from a place of love. But for someone to find me attractive without even knowing my personality very well? There has got to be a catch or some kind of trick. Like this does not make sense at all and it makes me so uncomfortable.

I have a weird fear that they're going to try to pressure me into sending nudes and then I'll have to block them. But I'm aware that fear is probably linked to past trauma, because they've never done anything like that before and don't show signs of it.

Like idk there must be some mistake or something. I don't even know how to describe how I'm feeling other than just uncomfortable and confused. I want ro be appreciative that someone compliments me and says they like how I look, but I just don't believe it. Something about it feels wrong and I'm not sure how to tell them to stop? Or maybe when my body dysmorphia lessens a little bit I won't be as uncomfortable? I don't know.

EDIT: something I forgot to add is that like,, even though I'm uncomfortable with their compliments, I am also waiting for the day where they get a better look at me and suddenly realize how ugly I am and then they stop talking to me and I just,, feel really sad thinking about that",1642127913.0

for me, accepting i has body dysmorphia was a huge step. for so long, i had heard so much about it but KNEW i couldn’t possibly have it because i could SEE my own reflection in the mirror and there was no way it could be lying to me

then one day i really deeped my behaviours, OBSESSIVELY mirror checking/staying out of bright places where people could see me (literally including ….. outside)/“mewing” and biting on something and pulling to crack my jaw so it would be “right”/making a suction so my lips get bigger/obsessively touching up my make up every half hour, filming myself from all angles so I could ANALYSE all my profiles and pick them apart ……. and i realised this is not normal. 

i guess im lucky because i know that “knowing you have bdd” is not even helpful for many, but from that very day i covered all the mirrors in my room, i closed my eyes when walking past reflective surfaces (like car windows), i didn’t allow myself to bring make up out etc etc. it was tough and anxiety inducing but it helped

I hate my female body and I have to live with it until I die,1,s3l2o6,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s3l2o6/i_hate_my_female_body_and_i_have_to_live_with_it/,3,"Its going to be a long post, so please bare with me. 

I’ll start by stating that I am a female (24) myself and do not suffer from past sexual/physical abuse. But for some unknown reason female anatomy always disgusted me. Even before I hit puberty myself. Vaginas look like freshly cut open wound secreting all kind of gross liquids from blood to white smelly mucus. Breasts disgust me too. I can’t stand looking at them or see them shaking. They just look like two ugly skin sacks or some kind of tumours to me. Pregnancy not only disgusts me but makes me sick to the stomach just by thinking of it. I can’t help but see females as some kind of breeding stock and in the age of internet where you can’t help but keep seeing half naked women everywhere because it’s the new norm I can’t help it, I am constantly feeling disgusted. 

It affects not only my self-esteem but also my sexual/dating life. I’ve only dated and had sexual relationships with men. They’ve all been good to me and tried to make me feel comfortable and good during the intimate times, but I just could never feel turned on because throughout the whole process I felt disgusted of my own body. I don’t go to beaches or spend much time outside during hot weather because wearing revealing clothes makes me feel like a total slut.

Some people told me I might be trans but I know for sure I am not. Without getting into too much details as to why I think that way, long story short I just don’t believe in transition. It looks and feels completely artificial to me. Sort of like fake breasts and lip fillers. I just know it’s not for me. If I could’ve chose my own sex just like you select it in video games I would obviously chose to be male, but since that’s literally impossible I can’t help but always feel like I am trapped in this body. I am grateful that it’s healthy and keeps me going, but at the same time it makes me want to throw up every time I look at it in the mirror. 

I know it’s not normal and I probably have some underlying mental problems that need to be clinically treated by mental health professionals. But I am not looking for solutions, I am just interested to know if there’s anyone out there who feels the same way I do. I’ve searched on the internet for so long hoping to find that I am not alone who has that twisted view on female bodies but I couldn’t find anyone mentioning anything. It made me feel that I am some kind of mad man who needs to be locked up. 

If you’re someone like, please do comment and share your thoughts and experiences. I’d greatly appreciate it. 

P.S. If you are here just to comment something like “you’re transphobic” or wish me to die just because I don’t share your views, please don’t bother and take that attitude back to Twitter or tik tok. I am not here to cater to anyones ideology.",1642140259.0

Any women here who find their bigger chests to be a trigger for BDD?,6,s34g1a,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s34g1a/any_women_here_who_find_their_bigger_chests_to_be/,4,"I do know that a common issue amongst women here is that their chest doesn't fit beauty standards or isn't big or 'shapely' enough...but I'm wondering if there's any women/girls here who face the complete opposite: wishing they had a smaller chest and finding it to be a big trigger for their BDD.

I've always had small boobs but since gaining weight naturally some of it has went to my chest. I still can't cope with it and also the feeling of going to the gym or clothes being more fitted around the chest. They feel (pardon me for saying this) gross and heavy and almost like they look far too big for my frame as I'm very short.

I know that in reality they aren't, and are still barely reaching average size lol, but it feels like BDD has enhanced or multiplied these feelings or changes I've got and it just feels so digusting to have them sensory-wise. Even more so that I'm trying to challenge myself into wearing tighter clothes and *not* dress like an early-2000s Adam Sandler anymore but my chest gets in the way of it. *Even worse* when you look down and all you can see is boob.

In the beginning, before I even knew about BDD really, I questioned if it was gender dysphoria or something as I personally seek a more lithe athletic build but I really don't think it's that as I am happy being a woman.

Just wondering if there's anyone out there who feels the same as me and if so, how do you manage it, or how do you feel about it?

Edit: Not sure why this is being downvoted a lot, nor am I sure why people think it's acceptable to send me weird messages claiming that this is something not worth being dysmorphic about. Everyone is different, leave me alone please.",1642094275.0
I hate myself,2,s3dfei,BodyDysmorphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/s3dfei/i_hate_myself/,2,Sometimes I really hate myself. I think I’m ugly and fat and only focus on flaws. Even though deep down I know that I am not and I am actually quite attractive. When I look in the mirror I hate myself. I cover mirrors so I don’t have to look at myself. It runs my life a lot of time. Has anyone had any success with getting better?,1642117972.0
