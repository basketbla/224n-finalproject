**KEY NOTES if you don't wanna read it all.**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**It’s all about having** ***a healthy calorie deficit applicable to your activity*** **if you want to lose weight.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Work out your TDEE for your calories and be realistic about your activity. Less than 10km distance walked/traveled/moved around each day is a sedentary lifestyle. Keep that in mind when saying how much you workout if you do.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**The times of day/night you eat doesn’t matter.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Taking body measurements and a photo journal is a must. Have one photo in just underwear and one in with an outfit on. Sometimes your critical eye will not see what actually changed where the outfit will.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**You don't have to exercise to lose weight but it helps a hell of a lot.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Just move! Whatever exercise that you will do regularly is good exercise. But be aware doing yoga everyday won't burn the same as a CrossFit class.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**This process takes a long time and if you are not consistent in you efforts then don't expect a change**.

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS! **They measure you gravity to the ground. That's it. There are other factors of changing body composition that are far more important and a end goal weight isn't a bad thing but shouldn't be gospel to how well you have done so far.**

&#x200B;

Now to the long winded stuff!

**--------------------**

**CALORIES**

**--------------------**

To lose weight it is a very simple principle of energy expenditure. You must expend more than you consume and that's it, a simple calorie deficit. Do that correctly and you will lose weight. Even if you suffer with something like PCOS it will work. Sometimes I noticed with clients is that it worked but was slower but it wasn't an excuse for it not to work.

&#x200B;

For an adult I recommend 250-500 calorie deficit of your maintenance calories. for 12-16 year olds I recommend no more than 150-200 calories as they are still growing so a small deficit is better for them and increasing a kids physical activity can a lot of the time be all that's needed for children with no deficit added at all.

A slow weight  loss is usually a sign of good weight loss where good habits are being  ingrained into your life and you have a healthy calorie deficit so for the average person going over 500 calorie deficit is pretty pointless and usually not sustainable with the exception of a doctor's recommendation or you are a bodybuilder.

Now if you are morbidly obese you may likely need to do a bigger deficit than 500 calories  of what you normally eat but I would advise you to calculate your calories for maintenance then compare it to the calories to what you have been eating so far and bring it down to maintenance calories first for 2-4 weeks as you adapt to a healthier level of calories before adding a deficit as well. Typically most people I helped were eating to excess of 2000 calories plus of what they should've been eating just to maintain their current weight.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Calculating Calories**

**--------------------**

[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net/) is my recommended calculator for this. Its not perfect but as calculators go it does the job reliably enough to be the one I recommend.

Your  Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how many  calories you burn per day with exercise is taken into account. It is  calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR which is  basically the calories your body requires to function healthily), then  multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.

Since  your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at rest, it  is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for the calories  you burn during the day. This is true even for those with a sedentary  lifestyle.

&#x200B;

Don’t freak out that they are higher than what you expect, remember slow steady weight loss is best.

&#x200B;

When choosing your activity levels, my personal belief (and how I was taught) is that if you don't travel 10km a day (i.e. you have covered 10km with your feet walking in some format that isn't exercise) then your general activity is sedentary. So if you don't cover that distance drop your activity by one level as you may workout 6 times a week (heavy exercise) but if you sit on your butt all day in an office job then a moderate exercise choice is probably wiser.

&#x200B;

With any calculation the more info you put in it, the more accurate it will be. So with that in mind if you are able to put your body fat percentage in, the calorie suggestion will be more accurate for you.

For preferred methods of measuring body fat, I like the 9 point caliper test but you do need someone that knows how to do it or it will not be very accurate and even then if they do know how to it  properly there is a +/-3% variable even still. I do not recommend bio-electrical impedance as it can vary widely depending on your body shape (think pear shaped people) and your hydration. I take my Fitbit aria with a massive pinch of salt and wait every 4 weeks when I can see my mate that knows how to do the 9 point test.

I wouldn't worry too much on figuring your body fat percentage out though as how your general body composition is as you go along is more important and whether it is changing for the better.

For kids (12-16yrs) don't worry about measuring it at all unless a doctor has requested to be aware of it specifically.

&#x200B;

**If you use a calculator to workout your TDEE then do not follow your fitness tracker.**

TDEE takes your daily life and exercise you do into equation so you don't have add ""exercise calories"" to your allowance as that has been done already, so keep to your TDEE not your trackers.

&#x200B;

**Also be aware that as you lose weight you will need to re-check your TDEE.**

If you lose 2-3kg that can be enough to need to re-work your TDEE so do be aware of that if your weight loss slows or plateaus.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**How to track what you eat?**

**--------------------**

These days the main two apps/websites are MyFitnessPal & Loseit. Both are good and regularly corrected and updated. I personally use MyFitnessspal myself.

It's quite simple log in what you eat (preferably at the time of eating so you remember it properly or when you food prep it) and I mean **everything** including that biscuit one of your work colleges offered you in passing.

&#x200B;

Also be aware of logging liquid calories as well. If you drink a lot of smoothies, cordial, fruit juices, soda or coffee. Milk and sugar are still calories (especially if you like lattes) so make sure these logged in as well as so many times you ""eat well"" but all those liquids are ruining your progress.

I have genuinely had past clients change nothing to their food apart from drop all drinks apart from water and lose 2-4 kg in a month so please look at everything that goes in you.

&#x200B;

In conjunction of using one of the apps you will need a good set of scales (preferably digital in my opinion) as if you don't accurately put in what you eat, then there is a high chance of you over eating and not being in a proper deficit. If you don't accurately log what you eat then you can't ever say you are being accurate with your diet. Studies have shown time and time again we as people underestimate what we eat greatly.

&#x200B;

I would not trust portion sizes of packaging that well as 99.9% of the time they don't match what has been put in the packet for example a plain wrap could say 62g a wrap (187 calories) on the packaging  but end up being a 72g serving so be 224 calories. Not a lot of difference (35 calories) but it can build up over multiple meals easily. 3 meals over a day x 35 =105 calories and that can be the difference of real changes especially of your planned deficit is only 250 calories.

&#x200B;

There are some communities that say that tracking food causes eating disorders but the realistic truth is that if you don't keep track of what you eat in some way with reasonable accuracy, the chances are you will overeat and not lose weight. That is not the fault of diet culture or anything like that, it is your responsibility.

&#x200B;

Once you have a pretty sensible diet that is working for you and gotten used to it and know it inside and out then you can start to eyeball your portions as no one wants to be stuck to a scale each time they cook forever **but** I recommend doing this with high volume low calorie foods or if you have an object that you use and will know within a reasonable amount of accuracy it will be that amount.

I have a tiny measuring jug that i can do portions of rice or pasta and I know what level is going to be right +/- 5g uncooked but I also admittedly allow for that inaccuracy in my diet and have an assumption any eyeballing is always the overestimate to cover myself and stop any disappointments.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Diet**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**I can't iterate enough that the one that you can sustain is the best diet!**

&#x200B;

It honestly doesn't matter if you follow slimmers world, keto, intermittent fasting (I kinda do this one) or anything thing else as like I said before if you are in a deficit you will lose weight.

A healthy balanced diet is preferable but not wholly necessary when it comes to losing weight but again recommended.

Personally  I think the best thing for your food is once you have your calories  worked out is to use a macro break. That’s the breakdown of how much  protein, fats and carbs you eat (apps can track that for you). If adding this seems overly complicated and feel too much then don't bother with it but I do think it is a good idea to do especially if trying to some form of exercise to 'tone' your physique.

I  would go for a 40% Protein, 40% Fats and 20% Carbs as a break. Protein  and fats help you feel fuller for longer and generally more satisfied  when eaten. Protein also helps keep your muscle mass while losing  weight (that is a bit bro science but also kinda true) especially if exercising regularly.

I  for the most part make sure I eat my quota of protein and don’t worry  too much about the break of fats and carbs as long as I hit my calorie  goal. Admittedly though I always  feel the most satisfied when I keep to the macro break stated.

I used to fast 19-20 hours a day and re-feed over 5-4 hours but with my girlfriend and her little one that doesn't really work well and though quite often I don't eat what they eat (they're vegetarian and I was told to never be one but that's another story) I like to be able to sit, eat and chat with them at the dinner table instead of sit there like a pleb or away on the sofa. so typically now I'll have a small lunch, biggish evening meal and snack a little while after. It a rough version of intermittent fasting but it works for me.

A dietitian I met had a cool chat with me and he said to add this to my guide to clear some things up and

“I could tell you to eat this or that and don’t eat this or that which, is kinda my job to do. But at the end of the day all I do is make a food plan that puts them on a calorie plan to lose weight, maintain weight or gain weight depending on what you medically need (deals with a lot of NHS work).

In a perfect world I’d tell you to never eat bacon as it’s pretty bad for you but it’s f\*\*king delicious and so I know you’re gonna eat it too like me but if you eat 2 slices of it a week, it won’t kill you. A little of everything is fine and excess of anything is bad. Stop over complicating it, eat meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, fat, carbs, protein and junk. Just not a lot of one thing. Oh and stay hydrated, so many times people moan about being hungry all the dam time and they’re just dehydrated.”

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**I don’t know what to eat for my calorie bracket and/or macro**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

[https://www.eatthismuch.com](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) – for recipe help. Its fairly good and you can choose the amount of meals you want as well as snacks and it will come up with ideas as well. It even lets you get rid of foods you don't like mushrooms and choose diet plans like keto etc to help you as much as possible and as far as I'm aware still free.

&#x200B;

Again I am not a dietician so I cannot say to you what to eat so please ask a government body registered dietician for something like that. Otherwise the link above has pretty good reviews with my peers and old clients.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**SCALES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEASUREMENT**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!**

&#x200B;

They really aren't, they are a good guide to **help show** a downward trend but do not dictate your successes or failures of you and how well you are doing.

Scales are the equipment that measures your relation to the earth's gravity that forever make us cry ourselves to sleep. Use them with a pinch of salt please I beg you.

Don’t aim to lose a  certain amount each week. Just aim to lose and accept it’s not a temporary measure it’s a lifestyle change and going to take a long time.  Accept that, plan for the long term and screw beach body ready crap.

&#x200B;

Along with scales I recommend taking a photo in just your underwear and also a photo in one particular outfit as well as taking body measurements with a tape measure.

[This youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZnioXCRhU) is old and cheesy but explains how to use a tape measure pretty well but ignore the calipers section as that's pretty naff.

&#x200B;

With how regular you take measurements, I would recommend going on the scales and taking a photo of yourself in your underwear once a week at the same time of day and the same day each week as if you stand on the scales repeatedly throughout day you will find your weight fluctuates so much in 24 hours.

&#x200B;

As for taking measurements with a tape measure and photo with your selected outfit I would recommend taking them every 2-4 weeks but try to always keep the intervals the same for consistency.

Ladies  your natural cycle can affect your weight greatly (you probably already  know this) so try not to forget it if the scales mess you around a bit.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/cm8hlt/one\_for\_the\_ladies\_who\_i\_see\_posting\_about\_lack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/cm8hlt/one_for_the_ladies_who_i_see_posting_about_lack/)

Explains this better than a male like me so I will leave the ladies to read up on another trainer I respect.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**SPEED OF WEIGHT LOSS**

**--------------------**

It is unfortunate but the truth is weight loss is not fast at the best of times and plateaus are often so strap in for a long haul. Some weeks will be 1kg loss, some 0.5kg and sometimes even a 100g (which will barely register on most scales) but you have to remember it is still a downward trend no matter how small.

If things are plateauing don't freak out, breathe and look at what you have been doing during the plateau.

1. Look at your past measurements and photos and see how you have changed (especially from the beginning).
2. Look at how well you have been eating or how accurately you have been tracking what you have been eating as a common issue is your eyeballing skills have been off on regular foods you have been eating.
3. Has your physical activity dropped as of late? Life and work can get in the way sometimes and you need to re-evaluate your TDEE temporally while your activity is lower.
4. Or the one good cause for a plateau is that since you have lost weight and your TDEE has dropped because of this. This can be the most common reason as when you lose weight (2-3kg) your TDEE will drop and it's normal. Weight loss is a fluid thing and so are your calories, be aware and adapt as necessary.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Exercise**

**--------------------**

To be honest do what exercise **you enjoy and will do regularly.** This is the most important thing about exercise as if you don't enjoy it 90% of the time, then you won't keep it up. It's as simple as that. Just be aware that yoga won't burn as much as a crossfit class.

&#x200B;

Now if you are stuck for ideas of what to do, here are some simple circuits you can do that don't require a lot of space. I would advise making sure you are warmed up before you do any exercise.

I recommend doing [this](https://darebee.com/workouts/quick-warmup-workout.html) followed by [this one](https://darebee.com/workouts/4-minute-warmup-workout.html) as they are quick, easy and get the job done (I recommend darebee for workout ideas in general if you're ever stuck for what to do).

The following 4 workouts are pretty simple and follow the same format:

Try to do 10 circuits with 1-2 mins rest between circuits. It doesn't matter if you can only do a couple of circuits at the start just do what you can do.

&#x200B;

**Workout 1**

|Exercise|REPS|
|:-|:-|
|Squat|15|
|Reverse Lunge|16|
|Press Up|15|
|Tricep Dip (off a chair or similar stable object)|15|

&#x200B;

**Workout 2**

|Plank|60 secs|
|Press Up|10|
|Squat|15|

|Jump Lunge|16|

&#x200B;

**Workout 4 - This one is a bit harder than the rest but see it as a challenge**

|Exercise|REPS|
|:-|:-|
|Burpee|15|
|Press Up|15|
|Jump Squat|15|
|Tricep Dip (off a chair or similar stable object)|15|
|Walking Lunges|16|
|Sprint on the spot|30 secs|

&#x200B;

With any exercise please look each up properly and make sure you know how to do it properly. Don't be afraid to make an exercise easier (or harder) if need be.

&#x200B;

After any workout you should make sure you cool down and stretch properly [this should be enough](https://darebee.com/workouts/top-to-bottom-workout.html) to cover most muscle groups.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Supplements?**

**--------------------**

Long story short, you don't need them. Some protein powder to help you get the protein quota and a good multi vit but keep it to that.

&#x200B;

Fat burners, fat metabolizors, fat removers are all crap. If it says it will help you burn fat, chances are it will be a waste of your money and you will be better off spending it elsewhere.

&#x200B;

When it comes to supplements I don't have much more to say on it to be honest. I don't think there is a need to go much more into them than that. Unless you are training for something specific don't bother to look into them unless you have a trainer that you use personally to advise you otherwise or ask some of the nutrition or supplement reddits here for more info.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ouff** well that is a lot of text and I hope it's better than my old one and it explains things a bit more clearly and the grammar and spelling wasn't awful (probably is but my dyslexia and English don't mix lol).

Comments: Coming off a week of gaining for the first time of my journey (0.2 Lbs), this was a week of new things for me. I started a new job at a large company and was told it would be more work than my previous cushy job. Fair enough considering the pay jump, and they were right. I didn't want to work out at night, so I moved my daily exercise to the early morning and started waking up at 4:30 AM. It was a bit of an adjustment and I drink a few cups of coffee at the office now, but I seem to be doing well. I am also eating more fruits, pushing my estimated calories closer towards 1,500.

Estimated Average calories eaten per day - 1300 - 1500 (based on counting)

Calorie Content: Lots of protein and fats, some carbs, and minimal processed sugars.

Drinks: Just lots of water.

Keep it up guys!

I would eat pizza for lunch and McDonald's for dinner, yeah i know. I had imsomnia, constipation, depression,low self esteem and anxiety attacks I was a mess. I Never exercised and was close to becoming diabetic according to my doctor. I went to the doctor one day because I wasn't feeling good 5 years ago and he told me I had severe high blood pressure and that I would have to take a medication the rest of my life in order to control it.                               
                                                                                                              I made a decision that day that I would cut out the soda , junk food and start eating healthy and to start exercising. It was tough to start from rock bottom and beg.  inning exercising. I couldn't afford a gym membership, so the only thing I could do was walk and that's what helped me lose over 100lbs. I was embarrassed at first to go walking in my neighborhood because i felt self conscious and was worried of what people would think of me , but then i said forget that its my life.

I downloaded a free pedometer app called pacer . It counts my steps daily. I eventually made it to 3 miles a day. Stopped drinking soda which was tough and switched to only drinking water . My teeth and body craved the soda so much and went thru a withdrawal from no more soda, but it went away after a few weeks.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                             1 thing that helped me was to always listen to music when i go on my walks.Then i started eating oatmeal every morning and i am no longer constipated .That was a game charger for me.  I eat turkey sandwiches,  chicken tacos,BBQ chicken, chicken breast, chicken sandwiches, avocado, steamed veggies, honey nut cheerios and lots and lots of iceberg lettuce. I eat 2 heads of lettuce by myself each week. I eat lettuce with my lunch daily. I dont like romain.I still eat a burger and fries every week .                                                                   
                                                                                                              I eventually took myself off the high blood pressure medication because it made me super thirsty after a year because i didn't want to be taking that the rest of my life. It was tough at first with the exercise and diet but I now don't sweat after walking a few feet and my clothes fit much better and always get compliments from my friends and family.

Just take it easy the first few weeks because it's a marathon not a race. I'm healthier now than I was when I was in my 20s and 30s.                                                                                      
                                                                                                          My insomnia, depression, constipation and anxiety attacks went away after a few months of just walking daily. It doesnt have to be 1 or 2 miles just a simple walk around the block after lunch or dinner will help tremendously trust me. I only have 1 year being in shape and still have a hard time when a woman smiles at me or says hello when im walking because i would never ever get smiles or hellos from women because i was overweight for so long.                                                    
                                                                                                        Just make sure to keep eating , dont skip meals or starve yourself. Make each meal a healthy meal protein, veggies, fruit etc.Hope this helps someone out there. If I can do it anyone can.

A little backstory, X is currently severely overweight , 300+ lbs/5 3*, and has reached the age of 55. Early-set arthritis has also begun in their right knee. Weight has been a challenge their whole lives and after a fantastic loss of 70+lbs over ten years ago, the weight was gained back and has gotten worse. 

Many times X says they want to lose weight but that there is no point because they’ll either gain it all back or that they are too old. They have admitted to constantly being sad about how bad things have gotten and consistently feel hopeless. I’ve tried motivating them in a variety of ways, but I am honestly lost on how to help them with this. Should professional help be hired? Is it too late to try? How can they avoid injury if they were to begin exercising? 

Thank you in advance for any support that can be given.",1645388915.0

Stalled / Slow Progress - Looking for potential culprits to progress,1,sxgd4g,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sxgd4g/stalled_slow_progress_looking_for_potential/,0,"Hey, gang.

So I'm trying to figure out what might be the culprit for what has been a slow-ish but steady weight loss that seems to have stalled since early February \~183lbs. Summary below of what I'm doing and how things are going. I'd appreciate any input to increase my weight loss in a sustainable manner:

**Progress Thus Far**

I've gone from \~192lbs to \~181.5lbs in the last 2 months. My goal is to get down to 165lbs (35 yo, Male, 5 ft 8 in).

**Exercise**

I run \~5km / \~3mi a day (5-7 days a week) and I eat roughly \~1600 - \~1800 calories a day. I plan on adding weight lifting and martial arts back into my routine soon but haven't been able to the last few months.

**Diet**

I'm relatively strict — eg, no cheat days, very consistent with portions and general food intake. I'm pretty much only eating steamed vegetables, fish, chicken, with light amounts of sauces that are low in fat and sugar, etc.. Almost entirely simple carbs like white rice. Light amounts of wheat-based carbs 2-3 meals a week.

I did quit drinking entirely in January and have kept this light in February, maybe 6-8 drinks a week. This is for-sure my weak spot I'm a bit of a social drinker and would love to not have to go completely dry for the entire duration of my weight loss routine. This *probably* is a contributor but I'm hoping to find ways to work around it.

**Calories In vs Out**

I'm guessing the daily caloric burn rate on FitBit isn't the *most* accurate but it notes I'm burning \~2500 Calories per day. Is this rate normal given the intake / output. Looks like I'm running at a -1400 Calorie deficit per week which as I understand should have me losing \~0.5lbs per week.

**Moving Forward**

I really don't want to drop my calorie intake much lower so I suppose the only remedy is to burn more calories? I know if I add weight lifting to my routine I'll probably put on a bit more lean mass to make use of existing intake, etc..

&#x200B;

I'd appreciate any input / recommendations.",1645404953.0
"POSSIBLE TW ⚠ ED recovery, weight loss, skin removal surgery.",2,sxax76,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sxax76/possible_tw_ed_recovery_weight_loss_skin_removal/,0,"I (26F) am diagnosed with anorexia. Here's the kicker, I'm overweight. I'm currently 245lbs at 5'4"". Between the age 16-18 (2012-2014) I also had an ED (Binge/purge) but was never diagnosed. My sister helped me work my way out of it and I was good for awhile. I left my fiance in the end of August of 2021. I was about 315lbs. At my yearly physical at the very beginning of January, i was 295. 15lbs wasn't enough. So the habits started again. I didn't notice it at first. It started out as ""I'm not really hungry"" and soon turned into ""I'm too sick on my stomach to eat, but I'm sick because I haven't eaten."" I'd proceed to eat a cracker or half a piece of toast. Repeat the cycle. Because of that, I've lost about 55lbs in just about 7 weeks. Which is like 7.5-8lbs a week being dropped. Looking at it like that makes me feel like it's impossible, however my therapist isn't impressed. We're now working on a program to help my relationship with food.

With the rapid weight loss, I now have a decent amount of flabby skin on my belly and fupa. Anyone have any experience with surgery to get rid of it?

Also, anyone have any tips or tricks to help recover from an ED? DIY free workouts to help with additional weight loss? I don't have the money at the moment for a gym membership.",1645389919.0

The Crossroads of Weight Loss and Food,1,sxc0qx,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sxc0qx/the_crossroads_of_weight_loss_and_food/,1,"Hello, all. I am new here and posting for some advice on how to have a more healthy relationship with food.

I recently had liposuction surgery. After the procedure, I was on a pretty strict diet that required low salt, grain, and sugar to aid in the healing process. My partner was extremely supportive and bought me all kinds of healthy food for the house, which I stuck to religiously as I didn't want to risk ruining such an expensive procedure.

The problem is, I've now developed a weird relationship with food. Whenever I eat anything that isn't green and leafy or fruit, I find myself feeling guilty. When my partner and I went out for our anniversary, I felt uncomfortable eating the steak with gravy and loaded potato I ordered. When my partner suggested we get drinks (with alcohol, to be clear) I completely rejected the idea because I felt it was wasted calories. Even last week, I came home tired and didn't want to fuss over dinner and so made myself a grilled cheese. Eating something made with butter and cheese made me feel gross and unhealthy.

I'm aware this isn't healthy. Being afraid of eating doesn't lead to a well-rounded diet. I just don't know how to stop feeling guilty for eating ""unhealthy"" foods.",1645392843.0

Beans are a spectacular food and if you aren’t eating them regularly then you should be.,12,swvlgc,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/swvlgc/beans_are_a_spectacular_food_and_if_you_arent/,2,"When losing 150 pounds in 2020 I didn’t have a clue what I was doing I just went for it and learned as I went. During the process of refinement I developed this effective but misguided view of which foods were good or bad. The goal was to eat foods that gave the most of particular desired nutrients for the least calories. This lead me to seeing egg whites, tuna, chicken breast, and whey as the ideal protein sources to measure everything else up to. This lead me to seeing broccoli, spinach, and collard greens as ideal sources of micronutrients to measure everything else up to. I saw oats as the ideal for fiber and resistant starches, and walnuts/flax seeds as ideal fats. This sort of dieting worked really well, fantastic lasting results.   
Three things happened recently though... tummy tuck, depressing circumstances, and I became a vegetarian. This resulted in me regressing 15 pounds and being unable to return to the same dieting method. I was upset to find out beans seem to be pretty much a requirement since I always viewed them as a meh protein source. If all you want is more protein then that is kinda true. This was very stupid of me to consider no further however as beans may not be ideal for any one particular nutrient be that macro or micro... but they are fantastically balanced for the majority of desired nutrients.   
bean got decent protein, tons of fiber and resistant starch(like oats), the little fat they have is 90% healthy fat, a respectable amount of micronutrients. Basically if you eat a mix of beans with flaxseed, rice, and dark leafy greens then not only will you hit a similar macro profile to over all with properly proportioned meals containing animal products. This is cause while beans may not be efficient in calories for any one nutrient, the over all yield per calorie is extremely good allowing the beans to act as several food group in one. They are almost like what you would get if you took egg whites, oats, and spinach and just smashed them together keeping similar benefits to the calories. It isn’t 100% ideal but damn are they close enough considering how little it takes to make up for it.",1645341780.0

Hello, I'm a 175cm 16 year old who started his weight loss journey at 97KG 7 months ago. During that time I lost 21Kg (46 lbs), currently 77Kg. I went to the gym for the first time for about 1 month before school started and I followed a calorie deficit for the whole time and I didn't have any problems doing so, after school started I basically had no time to go to the gym so i had to stop for a few months. I was still on a calorie deficit though.

So now I recently started going gym again 1 month ago to try and build some muscle but still cut a bit of weight, so far it has been great and im also seeing some result on my biceps.  
Before today I was still on the old calorie deficit and an instructor at my gym gave me a new diet, high in protein but still on a lil calorie deficit so i can cut a little more of fat.

I go to the gym 3 times a week and work out full body each day ( ≈ 1h 30m - 2h)

The diet :  
Drink minimum 2L water  
Breakfast: 170 ml Greek Yogurt, a banana, and some integral crackers.

School break: Integral sandwitch bread with 80g of bresaola.

Lunch: 80g rice with 150g chicken breast or 150g beef

Dinner: 80g integral bread with 200g chicken breast  
and before sleep I eat a 170g yogurt and 3 walnuts

(I didnt add whatever i eat pre and after workout in this list)

Im a bit scared if this diet is gonna make me gain weight, since i havent eaten this much in a while (since my calorie deficit started) and I was also wondering if this diet is good enough to build some muscle and still cut a bit of fat.

Thanks in regards",1645385669.0

Tips from my (ongoing) weight loss journey,1,sx8ty4,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sx8ty4/tips_from_my_ongoing_weight_loss_journey/,1,"30 M; 

Height: 5'5; 

Starting Weight: 190lbs; 

Current Weight: 158lbs; 

Final Goal: 140lbs

So I ended up gaining about 40lbs during the pandemic as all my avenues for physical exercise (gym, playing sports) came to an abrupt halt and lazy dietary habits increased manifold from April 2020 to May 2021. I started working out slowly from June 2021 onwards balancing it with work and applications to business schools. Here is what I have learned:

&#x200B;

1. You can start small BUT stay consistent

When I first started working out I would get winded early. But what helped was I kept at it and stayed consistent. If I could only run on the treadmill for 10 minutes at 8km/hr I would do that and then walk if needed for another 10 minutes. But I did that 3 to 4 times a week. If I felt winded after 1 set of 10-12 mountain climbers I would still do it. Slowly but surely I was able to rebuild my endurance, stamina, and strength.

&#x200B;

2. DIET really is very very important. Don't go absolutely crazy on cheat days.

I cut out most of my junk food. Even when I have cravings I am strategic about what I am eating. Come up with diets and look for foods that you can enjoy eating in a sustainable manner. For e.g. if you want to eat meat go for white meat and avoid red meat. Don't eat fried chicken but go for boiled, grilled versions of it. Try making a salad at home with ingredients that you will like.

&#x200B;

3. WALK! If you cannot run or jog then WALK.

For the longest time, I thought walking really wouldn't help me and it was only for people over 50 years old. But it really has helped me build my stamina, endurance, and eventually enabled me to even jog for longer distances. I started with 5kms 3-4 times a week. By Jan 2022, I was jogging 20-30 km a day on the weekends. It also helped me reduce my cholesterol.

&#x200B;

4. Your competition is only you. Consistency and practice make progress.

You may want the figure of a Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Evans. But you won't get there in a week or even a month. Your comparison is with yourself from a week ago or a month ago. The results will come if you keep at it. If you can do 10 pushups in one go today, keep at it and eventually you will be able to push yourself to do 12 in one go and then 15 in one set and so on. Don't be discouraged because that toned guy or girl at your gym can do pushups or burpees so effortlessly while you can barely do any. Your competition is with yourself and not others.

&#x200B;

5. Make sure to include simple exercises in your daily routine.

If you lead a very busy life with a lot of work. Try to take the stairs instead of the elevators. If you have a job that requires you to sit for long hours, try walking for 5-10 mins every 1-2 hours. 

&#x200B;

6. Lift weights.

This helps in building muscles and strengthening your core.

&#x200B;

8. CALORIE DEFICIT.

If you are looking to lose weight, this is the most important thing. You can work out for 3 hours every day but if you cannot eat right it won't matter! Eat light dinners and early. Keep fruit if you can afford it to help you when you get late-night cravings.

&#x200B;

9. If you can, play a sport occasionally or go swimming. 

Something you like -basketball, badminton, squash, lawn tennis, etc. This can help you burn calories, improve flexibility and overall mobility.

&#x200B;

10. Measure inch loss, especially if and when your weight remains constant.

There were periods where I was putting in the work and taking care of my diet but my weight just wouldn't go any lower. What I noticed though was I did have noticeable inch loss around different parts of my body. So don't get disheartened, if by chance, your weight stays constant for some period. Do not give up and keep going. 

&#x200B;

I am someone who absolutely loves food. So controlling my diet has been especially difficult for me but it now comes naturally. I could have friends or family enjoying an ice cream or an amazing dessert but 9 times out of 10 I am not tempted to get one myself. 

Some days it's tough to see some of the stubborn belly fat still there after so much effort. But I remind myself of where I began (190lbs) and where I have reached (158lbs). Cherish the progress you have made and use it to motivate yourself to keep pushing.

I will end with something that has kept me going: The fastest way to get there is slowly.",1645384463.0
How should I know what a good calorie deficit is and what's too much?,1,sx8q5g,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sx8q5g/how_should_i_know_what_a_good_calorie_deficit_is/,3,"At current I'm 182cm and 125.4kg and I've been told a good calorie deficit would be around 1700 down from like 2200 or whatever which would be like the average intake to sustain my bulk. The past week I've eaten 2 meals a day of roughly 450 calories each and then just like bits of toast or cereal nothing sugary but I'm hitting my key food groups I'm pretty sure like a fruity yoghurt so dairy and fruit, a pasta meal so veg carbs and protein and then cereal and bread is extra carbs and protein but I'm pretty sure I'm barely scraping 1000-1200 calories a day and I know that big deficits slow metabolism so should I eat more to lose weight or just eat what I'm eating if I'm comfortable with it with the option to eat a bit more freely without the guilt. 

I am not really good at my diet and stuff I'm just making sure to cut out sugar and snacking whilst controlling portion sizes. Please give me any feedback I'd really appreciate it cause I feel like to get it anywhere else I'd have to sign up to a program but I'm just looking to calorie Count and do a bit of exercise cause I know I'm already a bit muscular I'm just looking to cut down to 95kg and I'll be ecstatic with that cause the 98kg has always been a huge barrier for me and I struggle to get lower than that.",1645384173.0

She went to a weight doctor and was given some pills to help her not be as hungry. She also was given a 2 week meal plan. Also I noticed I was getting a lot of downvotes. I’ve never shown any frustration towards her or pressured her. All I show is support towards everything she does. I’m here today simply because I’ve seen her struggling so much and wanted to figure something out to help her.

Yes I didn’t believe diet was that important but I was proven wrong. I also never gave her advice besides twice because I barely know anything myself. I use to tell her to just go on Reddit and ask in one of the subs. Thank you to the people who taught me new things.

Currently she is around 260lbs I think. And she has been wanting to lose weight. She believes that diet is way more important than exercise for losing weight. Which I don’t agree with.

Currently she has paid for many weight loss pills and drinks. Have started diets than suddenly stop. But she has only done a month worth of working out in the past year and a half. She has a good amount of free time so what are some workout routines she can do? What diet should she be on? 

She use to bicycle in a sauna as a workout. But I feel she needs more than that to really burn the fat. If I sound a bit mean I apologize it’s just that there has been a lot of money wasted on “Lose weight quick with no effort” products. She is actually at a weight loss doctor right now which I don’t know if it’s worth it.

For three weeks now I've started to get back at it, I started counting calories again (2000 is my daily intake, I count calories and macros) I'm eating nutrient rich foods and I almost completely eliminated any sort of processed foods, I try to cook every meal at home and if I go out, I find the healthiest option. In addition to that I've been weightlifting and doing cardio (3x week weightlifting and 2x week cardio on a bike or treadmill) but I have seen no changes in my weight whatsoever. 

My girlfriend says I may be putting on muscle and this not seeing any changes on the scale, but I honestly doubt I've put on that much muscle to compensate for the weightloss that should've occoured by now. I wasn't expecting to lose a lot in three weeks, but not seeing even the slightest budge on the scale makes me feel depressed.

Have been at a plateau for years :-( Help!,1,sx4dc6,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sx4dc6/have_been_at_a_plateau_for_years_help/,1,"!! TW disordered eating !!
hi everyone ! 

I’ve struggled with my weight since my teens, and have gone through various different stages of dealing with that struggle - including bulimia, periods of restricted eating, and getting into the gym and working out etc….

 I’m now 24 and feel like I’m hitting a plateau with my body. For context, I’m 5”1 and so I naturally look quite curvy in comparison to other women. 

Over the past year, I’ve finally hit a good balance (I think). I don’t binge regularly, I eat balanced meals 3 times a day, and I’ve got to a great place with working out - I do strength training, barre classes and yoga, and really enjoy how I feel when I do these exercises. unfortunately I do sometimes still consciously restrict (it’s hard to surpass the impulses to undereat sometimes) but I do eat very healthily and in a balanced manner around 80% of the time. however - my body composition has not changed in the slightest. The only time I think it recognisably changed was during some admittedly unhealthy stages (eg my first stage of bulimia, a period when I worked in theatre productions and didn’t have much time to eat). 

My question is - now I’m at this healthy stage - what am I doing wrong? Am I mistaken in expecting to see a change ?!! 

The only possibilities I can see are either that I potentially need to eat more and factor in some more cardio…and maybe be a bit more patient…!!!

I’d love to hear from people who have been in a similar situation who might have advice!!!

I'm not in control of the food I receive. I have asked time and time again to reduce my portion sizes, but nobody remembers for long, in the long-term, it returns back to the old sizes. I have had this argument before, I confronted them about their behaviour and how I would appreciate for change, but I'm told that I'm ""selfish"", how I don't consider how much of a hassle it is to make that change, and if I had so much to complain about then I should make the food myself. They know well enough that cooking stresses me out.

I've tried to exercise, but I get teased when I do, so I feel embarrassed to exercise at all because my parents think that I'm trying to get ""pretty"". No, I'm overweight - as shown in my BMI index.

Despite several reattempting efforts to change the course of my weight, my family just doesn't allow for this change to occur. I understand that my parents are concerned that I may be developing an eating disorder, but I need them to wake up and realise the weight I am at right now isn't normal either. I'm at an impasse, I feel insecure, unhappy, and furthermore, trapped.",1645372504.0

Unfortunately, I havent succeedded. Therefore I come to you guys, who I have learnt a lot from my journey over the last year for advice. I understand that everyone goes through this, but I think generalised solutions are not working for me, and I need your help  in understanding the specifics of fat loss mechanism that is unique to me.

My short term goal is to get to 22 % body fat by the end of this year, and then I can work on longer goal of getting to somewhere bte 10 to 15 %. I have been stuck on 30% body fat for over a month now. I started around 35-36 % fat and 106 kgs last year in july, a before that I beleive( I didnt have a scale) I was about 115-120 kgs and came down to 106 by OMAD. I started collecting data from july last year but untuil november I had logged the data with incorrect height, so the calculations on my MI smart scale are wrong, therefore I only have accurate data from November onwards. I wiegh myself every saturday and focus on getting the fat loss down.  Data is in a spread sheet here

I didnt like measuring calories for food, but I tried to eat healthy food with more milk based protein and vegetables and fibre ( I am a vegeterain, getting enough protein while staying in a cut is hard and eating less carbs is harder) and for a while I was losing weight at a good pace so I wasnt worried. since I hit plateau I ve been measuring my calories on my fitness pal from Jan last week onwards, Ive also got a scale ( all the posts on reddit for some reason hangup on this... so Yes I got a scale, and yes I measure everything that goes in my mouth, and no its not measured incorrectly).

I am attaching screenshots of my fitness pal summary to give you an idea.  I used TDEE calculator [https://tdeecalculator.net/](https://tdeecalculator.net/) with moderately excercise 3-5 days a week, ( I do a 20 minute run on treadmill where my heart rate is anaerobic for 66 % of it according to my smartwatch, and strength strain with low weights and high volume ( 10 x 5 ) with the lowest or second lowest weight available on that particular machine and my muscles give out by the last set , atleast for the upper body, so I think the weight is okay for me? I alternate days between upper body on one day and lower body,kettlebell swing,planks and situps the other day) and it spits out my maintainance to 2724 calories per day; with cutting of 500 to 2224 calories. I put cutting calories as a goal on myfitness pal, I dont eat my excercise calories back and I am under the limit every single day, except maybe on one day over the weekend, when I get a takeout, which is hard to enter on myfitness pal.

&#x200B;

you don't need to count your calories too tightly to loose weight. you don't absolutely need to weigh your food and calculate everything to lose weight. what you need is to use good judgement over quantities and frequencies when it comes to meals and snacks.

for two weeks now i've been counting with an app. entering my foods from the website's database and checking the nutritional values to make sure the website isn't wrong. i've already lost about 3 - 4lbs so far. i know it's not much and not visibly noticeable but it's still a result i like to see.

even though the app isn't 100% accurate, it's accurate enough for me and it still leads me to eat smaller more reasonable portions all while being content with the meals i eat.

for example: today for lunch, i had an avocado with three spoons of black beans and a little bit of hummus with hot sauce. i don't need the app to tell me how much calories that is, because by just looking at it, i can know that it's not too much because it looks like a portion size a healthy normal person would normally eat. now the whole of that might have amounted between 450 - 550 calories, but it's not that important, because it's a normal lunch, if it looks and feels right according to the goals i have, then it is. we shouldn't stress too much over numbers that are not even that accurate on the packages themselves.

so although counting is important in order to give you a good idea of how much nutrients you get from foods, it is just as important to go with eating in a way that you feel is right for you, according to you tdee and bmr. unless you have a form of ED, you can absolutely know if you are overeating or undereating by just looking at the portion sizes and what they contain, and most importantly, you can know that by looking at the results that you can observe in your body.

i still enter the things i eat in the app, but unless i'm eating some junk food for a cheat meal or getting a second plate for dinner, i don't have to limit my calories too much. of course you can't binge eat or eat oversized portions thinking this is right, but this journey is about building a better relationship with food and we don't entirely have to rely on numbers for that. they can help as training wheels, but at some point when we get to our healthy weight, we need to take the wheels off and learn to ride on our own judgement and general knowledge of how food interacts with our body, and how we interact with it.",1645307690.0

So I really focused on my calorie intake,  became really diligent with tracking everything. I’m logging everything. I am consistently eating <1000 daily. I started doing beginner yoga and body weight resistance exercises.
Prior to July, I was eating around 1250-1500 calories and not exercising. 

My days usually look like this:
Breakfast: coffee that is usually black. Occasionally I use 1 tbsp of almond milk creamer. celery juice 


I typically don’t eat lunch. 

Dinner is either an apple with peanut butter, 2 egg whites with 1 cup or steamed vegetables that are not seasoned with anything besides salt and pepper. 
I don’t drink anything besides water and coffee (and celery juice in the am) 


I’m still not losing weight. I have not lost enough fat to be in starvation mode. Is this a plateau? Do I need more exercise? Less food? 

I’m f30, 5’2.” 

Any advice would be extremely appreciated !

Edited to add - I am on a pretty restricted diet even when I’m not trying to lose weight due to food allergies and ulcerative colitis. Gluten/dairy/meat are all out as well as certain (but not all thank god) high FODMAP foods.",1645333901.0

"Time to see a doctor, or am I delusional?",1,swomfe,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/swomfe/time_to_see_a_doctor_or_am_i_delusional/,1,"I’m trying to work out if there is something really obvious in my diet/lifestyle that is causing my weight gain before I decide to take time off work to see a doctor.

Some background: 35, female, 0 chance of pregnancy, 162cm tall, as of today weight is 66.1kg which bumps me to overweight.

I have always been a healthy weight and had a healthy diet. I have never been sporty and enjoy my down time relaxing at home, but always done a lot of walking and occasional other exercise. In recent years I have gradually gained weight and I accepted this part of a slowing metabolism with age. I was still a healthy weight (58~60kg). Over the Christmas holidays, I put on a lot of weight, which I originally put down to the usual Christmas excess in food and the fact I had a spate of poor health in January that limited my physical activity (concussion + vertigo + non-COVID cold). However, that time has passed and I continue to gain weight at a rate of 500-800grams per week, which is a lot! It’s definitely not muscle gain as my clothes are much tighter (I’m not good at measuring my waist, so use the feel of my clothes as a guide). I get that I might not be doing enough to loose the weight I gained, but I don’t see what I’m doing to gain so much.

Here’s some info:

Diet:
Drinks- I mostly drink water, but also a lot of tea and iced tea which I make myself and has no sugar added. I have an iced coffee with skim milk once per day when I drive home to keep me awake and I also make this myself the night before without sugar. I also sometimes drink coconut water and never drink soft drinks or alcohol.

Food- I have always disliked fast food and never eat it. I make my lunch for work everyday and this consists of: 1 sandwich made with either sourdough, rye or grain bread, 1 Greek yogurt (150g), 1 piece of fruit. I usually take a boiled egg and small handful of unsalted nuts as a snack, but I don’t always eat them. Dinner is different every night, but I always make it myself and always eat a lot of salads and vegetables.

I will usually enjoy a piece of cake or two over the weekend, but not during the week. If I have something sweet during the week it’s usually just a biscuit or two with tea.

I started intermittent fasting a few years ago when I noticed I  was putting on a little weight as I got older, so I only eat between 11am and 7pm, that goes for non-water drinks. That works really well for my work schedule, on weekends I don’t always stick it.

Keeping track of calories, I eat roughly 1800 per day, give or take.

Lifestyle:
I work as a school teacher and rarely get time to sit down when I’m at work. I usually get my 10000 steps on weekdays, and typically burn 2,200 calories a day according to Fitbit. I go to yoga once a week. I do a 30 min roller skate once or twice per week. I sleep ok (6-7 hours). Stress level can be high at work, but nothing new. Do a lot of TV watching in the evenings.


Now, I can see room to reduce calorie intake and increase exercise. I don’t care about being athletic or toned. I just want to be healthy and really can’t see where I’m going wrong and what I’m doing that I’m still putting on so much weight. Can anyone see something I can’t?",1645318404.0

I had brain surgery in 2015 and that caused a LOT of my weight gain because I was limited in what I could do, meds changing, migraines, injections, etc ...

Since January pre-covid, I was given phentermine by my primary doctor because I couldn't do much exercise. (I know it's not recommended please don't come at me) when I was at my highest 190. During this time I was cycling on a stationary bike for about 4-5 days a week.

After 3 months I got down to 150 and kind of hot a plateau. I was off the meds. This was mid COVID so I became even more invested in bike riding (I watched Peloton videos and rode a cheap bike - still do.) Since I hit a plateau I thought ""hey why not try low carb/keto""

I got down to about 140 and then kind of fell off the train with the food. Keto is freaking hard but I've been doing it for over a year+

So now it's 2022. I've been able to start alternating between weight lifting and cycling. Only now I'm at an aggressive plateau. I can't lose any weight to save my life. I measure foods, weight things, etc. And I'm not seeing any changes. I'm currently 165 and have been for almost 3 months. 

I struggle with IBS and im currently on medication to help that...

I'm on birth control and wondering if possibly that is affecting my weight loss cause of the hormones. Also, I'm extremely cold almost 90% of the time so I'm getting my thyroid checked this week. 

Does anyone have any recommendations?? I am willing to try anything different (besides MLMs). I have a doctor's appointment this week, should I ask to get any other blood work, testings, etc?

For the past few months I've been in a pit of depression. My usual day goes wake up, stay in bed, eat, go back to bed, sleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day for about 3 months. 

I had a job there in McDonald's for about a month but I hated it, I really hate working with food and those type of people and so I have now left it. 

I have no money to my name, and living with mum, I need a job soon to pay my way. 

My weight is something that has held me back from putting myself out there as I'm really self conscious. I wear jumpers and hoodies all the time, even when it's very hot as t-shirts don't for right, and having to wear that uniform in work absolutely killed me. 

I do honestly feel that if I lost my weight and was happier I'd feel comfortable working any job and possibly going back into education to get a degree of sorts.

I knew I was going to have to get a replacement hip (I'm a nurse and know the signs). Unfortunately, I am a  US citizen and a single mom, so I had to save up and get prepared. Thankfully, because I knew what was wrong, I never complained to my doctor about it so that when I finally had saved up enough money for the deductible and co-pays, I wouldn't be denied short-term disability. I am steadily getting worse, and walking or standing is problematic and painful. And I have gained about 40 pounds over the last 7 years.

Finally, in June 2021, I had a hip replacement. Oh, the joy of finally being able to walk again without pain. Within a month, I am walking without a cane. Now, 8 months later, I go to the doctor for a follow-up, and I have lost 10 pounds.

So my question is, do you think it's possible that I lost 10 pounds just from being able to move and walk normally?",1645278573.0

Can’t figure out calorie goal,2,sw90px,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sw90px/cant_figure_out_calorie_goal/,7,"Hey guys so I am a 5’7 33 male, about 18% bf. Recently went down from 166 to 156 just changing some eating habits. I had weight lifted a lot in the past and just ate as much as I wanted to gain muscle, I had to stop because of an injury but wanted to start up again.

Instead of just bulking up right now my goal is To get down to below 12% body fat, while at least maintaining muscle perhaps building some lean mass. I’m trying to get at least 150 g of protein a day, and said a calorie goal of 1800 to 2000 calories A day, I might allow myself one or 200 more if I had a particularly tough lifting session. A few days I’ve eaten 1500 and not felt particularly bad.The thing is I just don’t know if this is correct, I’m having a lot of trouble figuring out what the calorie goal should be in with my true TDEE is. I don’t want to eat too little of that my muscles just eat themselves and I’m not burning fat at the right light rate, But like I said for now losing body fat is the main goal, putting on muscle is something I want to do after once I am very lean. I am lifting/cycling 3-4 times a week.

Does a certain weight look different on you depending if you gained up to that weight or lost down to it?,4,sw3vd3,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sw3vd3/does_a_certain_weight_look_different_on_you/,3,"This is a question I’ve just randomly been curious about but could never word well enough in Google to get an answer lol.

Would the person look the same at 150 when they lost weight from 180 to there, as they did when they gained from 120 to there?

I understand that the perception would be askew. Like obviously going from 180 to 150 would seem better because you lost weight to it, but would you still look as fat as you felt when you had climbed up to 150 originally? Or would you look better because you got there burning fat rather than gaining fat.

I do have curves so not all of the weight just sits in my belly.

She’s treating me like an elephant and I’m literally 30lbs overweight, nothing I can’t reverse. Remarks like this are utter emotional abuse and I really want to cut her out of my life when she treats me this way. The crazy part is my grandma is 160 but she’s short and looks bigger then me because of her height… but I wouldn’t say that to hurt her. My ex started criticizing my body so horribly and called me fat constantly- the irony he is a 330lb male. Pot calling the kettle black? People treat you so much different when you gain weight. When I was skinny I didn’t have these problems, had a sugar daddy, got attention everywhere I went, and still I was so insecure but now it’s worse. I look at myself in disgust.

Here’s the issue: despite being underweight, I still have a little bit of belly fat, particularly my lower belly. My body looks alright when I clench my tummy but when I’m relaxing the belly fat there really bothers me.

(23f) Lost 100+ lbs in 2019: a word of encouragement/advice,207,sv5g7v,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sv5g7v/23f_lost_100_lbs_in_2019_a_word_of/,16,"Hello! I am definitely not a doctor or nutritionist, first and foremost. Just a 23 year old girl who has made some pretty immense and lasting changes in my life. What I say may not apply to everyone and I do not intend any harm!

First, if you’re on your journey, kudos on making a first step, whatever that may be. I know that i’d tried to lose weight what felt like hundreds of times before it actually stuck and became a lifestyle change - that is totally normal and “slip ups” happen, even to people who have lost 100+lbs. Don’t discourage yourself for it. Every day, every minute is an opportunity to reframe your thoughts. You’re not a failure if you “mess up”, you’re on a journey. You’re not starting over, you’re where you need to be.

I would start with trust. How much do you trust yourself? When you say you’re going to do something, do you believe that you’re going to do it? I ask, because when I first started my journey this was the one question that changed everything for me personally. I realized that when I promised that i’d not binge, i’d go for the walk, i’d eat until i’m full and then stop - i wouldn’t. I knew I wouldn’t. I didn’t trust myself to stick to my own word, so I broke it. Every time I broke my own trust, I trusted myself even less. I’d binge again because I knew I wasn’t capable. 

Start by rebuilding trust with yourself. Little, tiny promises. It doesn’t matter what they are, but I started with a glass of water every morning, first thing. I did that for a few weeks, and felt much more confident. Then, I started putting workout clothes on as soon as I woke up. No workout, just promising that I’d put the sports bra and leggings on in the morning. Then, after making that a habit, I built momentum. I felt more confident. I started stretching, drinking more water, and my identity began to shift. I felt like I was changing my habits, which changed how I saw myself. It snowballed. I started going for morning walks. I started taking pictures of my meals because I was proud of how colourful they were with different fruits and veggies. Every action and every repetition was building momentum. Did I “fall off the wagon”? Sure. But, it’s only falling off a “wagon” if you don’t believe you’re in control. YOU ARE THE WAGON - you can’t fall off. No matter which way you turn or which path you take, you’re still you. Nothing is going on without you, you’re still here. Every step (“good” or “bad”) is a step in your journey, and convincing yourself that a “slip up” is permanent or catastrophic is one of the biggest and most damaging thought you can have during the process. You’re a human, and you are not a mistake. You may make decisions that don’t align with your goals at times, but they’re only decisions. Not permanent trajectories. You can choose the next moment to shift your thinking, and focus on the next decision.

You can do this, I promise. Pay attention to your body and how it feels when you eat certain things. I have realized that dairy bloats me and makes my skin inflamed, whereas going a bit lighter on starchy foods like potatoes, bread and rice and opting for more veggies makes my digestion better and my bloating go away. Listen to your wonderful body. Pay attention to how things make you feel - food, media, relationships - your body will tell you things if you listen. When things get overwhelming, please seek help from a doctor, therapist, or licensed professional. You can do this.",1645148364.0

I started birth control about 2 years ago. When I did, I was around 150 LBS. i gained about 30-40 LBS when I started, but that was it. I started dieting and cut my daily calorie intake down to about 1.2k. I would eat maybe a couple eggs for breakfast, a small dinner, and maybe a salad every now and then. Occasional snacking too, but never anything extreme. didn't lose any weight at all, decided to get a Y membership. Would do things like russian twists and cardio, but i still wouldn't lose weight!! I stopping going to the gym maybe last November since it was getting expensive. I also stopped taking birth control around this time too, since I thought it had something to do with my weight. Over the holidays (from thanksgiving to new years), i somehow gained another 30 LBS. i watched what I ate. I stayed under/at my 1.2k calorie limit. I avoided sweets as much as i could. I do not drink. I dont have a ""big stomach"" and get very sick if i eat too much in one sitting, so its very hard for me to overeat anyway. I weigh about 220 now, have only gained weight since last year. I have cut my calorie limit down to 900 since February started because I am desperate to lose weight. For the past month ive maybe eaten nothing but omletts (bell peppers, mushrooms, etc in them. i dont consume dairy product so i dont use milk or cheese). My salads usually consist of lettuce, spinach, cabbage, onion, cucumber .... occasionally i eat slim jims on my way to work because they are cheap and easy to eat while driving to my job. i havent gained muscle mass either, it definitely isnt that. i also went up a few cup sizes (DD->I cup) since I started BC, so that mighr be it too, but i have definitely put on stomach, arm, thigh, and butt weight too. Even my face has gotten fat. I feel like I could starve myself and still somehow gain weight. Ive also tried metabolism pills and they dont help. im seriously at a loss. 

Ive tried everything. how on earth am i gaining weight. how can i lose weight. ill need to lose almost 100 pounds to get back to what i was 2 years ago.",1645232001.0

Anyone struggling losing pregnancy weight?,1,svzp6t,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/svzp6t/anyone_struggling_losing_pregnancy_weight/,1,"(Sorry for the long post)

I had my last child 2 years ago and for the life of me I cannot get rid of this pesky pregnancy weight! Pre pregnancy I weighed 142lbs and right before I gave birth I was… 170lbs!!! Right after giving birth, I weighed 154lbs and now I constantly fluctuate between 154 to 157lbs. I’ve done so many things to lose weight and it just won’t go away or stay away. I am super self conscious of my body, always have been since I was a teen (I’m now 25). What doesn’t help is that I checked on google what my bmi should be and it says I’m over weight for my size (I’m 5’4) and I hate looking at myself in the mirror bc every time I do, I’m constantly nit picking everything about my mom bod. This sounds silly but I dont even like taking cute selfies or pictures of myself anymore, even on my “I feel pretty” days I dont take pics anymore bc I’m that self conscious about my body.

At my strongest, i went to the gym 6 days a week, 30 mins cardo, 1 hour strength training daily (4-10 reps to failure).

Currently i go to the gym 5 days a week, 1 hour cardio followed by 30-45 mins mild weight training (10-15+ reps).

I started seeing a pattern that whenever I had more food I lost weight, so since last year I’ve made sure that I ate 3 meals. Most of my meals r protein rich. To up my metabolism, I even tried carb cycling (<30g carbs on 4 days, about 50g carbs on 1 day, and >100g on 2 days in a week). I’ve tried literally everything. High protein, and low fat/low carb diet. NTHG SEEMS TO WORK. I think I hv a hormone problem, but Idk. Nd although 128lbs is less and I cant loose a lot of weight, I still wanna loose fat. My muscles hv increased but it’s so demotivating when I can’t see any difference in my figure. Ps I even got a food weighing balance to make sure my calories in were being correctly measured. Now I’m trying to hit at least 1400 daily (my TDE is 1750 without any exercise).

It would be great if u could help me and at least let me know if I should try consuming more calories (and keep my protein, water, fruit intake high). Will that work?? It might regulate my hormones and increase my metabolism. Will eating more help me gain more muscle and then probably assist me in losing fat from my abdomen and thighs??

Can I get advice on why the rate of fat loss may speed up? (5ft 8 male 205lbs)  I'm often averaging 1.5 to 2 lbs loss a week, but as of these last 2 weeks, I have lost close to 10lbs. I haven't changed my calories (1800-2000 calories/day), my Neat hasn't changed much, and I haven't lost strength. I understand that the whoosh effect is a thing, but I have only known it to happen in a single drop of scale weight not lasting over 2 weeks. Is this just a large amount of water wieght I've held on to?
No life events have occurred, and my stress levels have not increased, and I haven't been under tracking my calories.
My current thought process is to ride it out and see if it gently plateaues or returns to what I'd expect.

So far it's been going well. I changed my eating habits for the better and I began walking around 13.000 steps everyday (sometimes more, sometimes less). To my surprise these little changes  allowed me to lose a lot of weight very quickly. I feel much better about myself and I also enjoy my new diet very much. I eat healthy but I don't stop myself from eating what I want when I have a craving (unless it's, idk, KFC or some other fast-foods). No cutting on carbs or anything. Also lots of protein and fiber. 

Thing is, today I started feeling incredibly tired out of nowhere. Then, around 19:00 I felt this strong, desperate need to eat something. Anything. Not a craving but a need so big I sort of felt like I couldn't control myself. I'm not sure if what I did was binge eating because everything I had were ""good"" calories. Some pumpkin seeds, two pears, a piece of bread and half a bar of dark chocolate. I think that what worries me is not so much what/how much I ate, but how tired and hungry I felt throughout the day, even though I'm actually eating around 200 calories more than before I started dieting/exercising. 

For some information, I didn't do anything out of the ordinary today. On the contrary. I stayed home and did some video editing (I'm a filmmaker student) which took a while so I didn't go in my usual daily walk.

fresh start,1,svpmsi,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/svpmsi/fresh_start/,4,"hi! i am in hopes of receiving advice for a fresh start on losing weight. i am a 17 year old guy (trans, fmab), 5’2, and i weigh anywhere from 170-180 lbs (70-81 kg). 

ive been considered obese my entire life pretty much. i lived in italy for a good portion of my life and ate very healthy and organic foods, but as soon as i moved back to america i started to discover assortments of fast foods and gained endless amounts of weight. 

i weighed about 108 pounds in fifth grade as an 10-11 year old. around that time i was classified as “pre-diabetic”. i went to a few health clinics and never stuck or tried to do any diets or anything. 

seven years later, i am still considered obese with a bmi of 31. 

in january i was extremely tired of being seen as obese so i started eating less and working out. 

i started by fasting and eating one meal a day. i placed strict restrictions on my diet and only allowed myself to eat during the hours of 5pm and 6pm (i still do), and on top of that i don’t like eating over 400 calories — so i usually intake around 300 calories a day during the time frame of 5pm and 6pm. 

i have a past with binge eating, so of course eating small meals once a day put a lot of extra stress on my mental health and physical health. i ended up binge eating a few times these past two months, and felt beyond guilty and disappointed afterwards. to try to relieve myself from this stress, i decided to take laxatives after each meal that felt too heavy in my stomach (i still am)

i attempted working out twice a day and that only left me extremely exhausted. 

i am currently eating no more than 400 calories once a day, and afterwards i take at least a 5mg pill of laxatives. i understand that this is not healthy but i am heavily disgusted with myself and i just want to be seen as a healthy weight. 

since i understand that my way of thinking is a problem for my health, both mentally and physically, i am here and willing to start fresh.

 I eat at an appropriate calorie deficit (only 1200 - 1500 calories a day) and go to the gym with a friend when it fits our schedules.

My weight is starting to effect me. Is this a good plan for me?,1,sva52q,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sva52q/my_weight_is_starting_to_effect_me_is_this_a_good/,1,"too long didn't read: I will focus on weight lifting three times a week. Will try for a basic tasting healthier diet (but won't be too hardcore about it).  


Effect or affect, I don't care if I used it incorrectly. That's not the point of the thread.  


I am noticing that I need to catch my breath more than before even if my weight hasn't changed. My feet hurt now. It could be something else but I am a pretty heavy person for a short guy (below average). I checked my weight last year and I am over 240 lbs. I do not take care of myself like I should. I have a few health problems like sleep apnea, possibly hypothyroidism, and a stomach problem which might be irritable bowel syndrome. Nothing seems to help to make my energy levels go up and now I'm going to try to change that. It is hard because I have very little energy at all. I'm surprised I am fast at work especially for how heavy I am.  


I have lost weight before and have been successful but for only a very short time. Last time back in 2013 I lost 20 lbs with a strict diet, lifting three days a week and cardio in between. I counted my macros and calories (wasn't 100% accurate but I lost about 1-2 lbs a week which is what I was aiming for). However, I cannot keep my weight down for long term. But I will try. I am so tired of being heavy and I have no self esteem because of my weight. I want to feel good and believe that I am a good looking guy.  


My plan is to eat healthier in general. I have always used the macronutrient method and counting calories. I don't think I'm going to be too strict on calories and I will be flexible with what I eat because I have a full time job and I seriously lack energy levels. I will eat basic foods and just make them taste as good as I can. I can't be super fancy but with time I hope I will.  


As for exercising I am thinking about joining a gym and heading there in the morning when there is very little traffic and hitting the weights. I won't do much cardio (until I lose a lot of weight) because I'm pretty heavy and lifting will get me to burn a lot. This has worked before. Going to the gym is a good opportunity for me because I can get exercise out of the way in the morning and head to work later in the day. I attempted to go to the gym in the evening in the past and there is too much traffic.   


Do you think this will be enough? I am not trying to lose weight/mass at any specific time. I definitely want to slim down and start feeling healthier. I don't want to have a hard time picking crap up off the floor and running out of breath. Slimming down will also help me look better and that would be good too. I'm just not sure if this will be enough because I haven't done serious exercise in like 7 years.",1645162535.0

So bit of back story. These previous two years were the healthiest years of my life so far. I (23M)was lucky enough to afford a personal trainer and lost 9 stone (26st -17st) and gained a love for lifting weights and walking!

Unfortunately last year I got a fever (not covid) and now I’m being investigated for a chronic illness (either fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue or lupus). I’ve gained 3 stone and my confidence is pretty much gone. I can barely move and when I do exercises or simply walk around the block, I’m in bed for three days after. Not to mention I’m back to being addicted to sugar (chocolate mostly) and I’m struggling to cook fresh or bulk cook due to pain. I have tried calorie counting but I either go so low that I’m eating just over 1000 calls or I’m binging. 

I’m currently in a government funded weight group and on the road to a bypass but I want to lose weight myself and get back to being healthy before any ops.

Basically I’m asking does anyone have any advice? Do any of you have chronic illnesses but manage to exercise? What recipes are best (heathy and tasty) recipes for me to make?",1645138902.0

She went from 120 pounds to 170 and then taking 9 months off work after our daughter was born she went up to 200 pounds. 

Back in highschool and up too a year before our daughter was born I was into weight lift and have a pretty good understanding of dieting and exercising. 

My wife is 5’7 
Not extremely active but she is looking to become more active once she has a good diet plan in place because she’s aware that 90% of losing or gaining weight is in the kitchen. 

She’s thinking of using the CICO method to lose the weight by only consuming 1,500 calories a day and only consuming carbs for her breakfast meal. Her exercise would be a 5K walk in the morning before work and 30 mins of exercise after work. She isn’t willing to go to a gym as of right yet but she is thinking of Doing the Insanity workout at home.

How Do I Change My Figure,0,supdoz,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/supdoz/how_do_i_change_my_figure/,4,"Hey everyone! Thank you for allowing me to post in this sub. I could really use some advice as to the best way to lose weight for my body type/lifestyle if anyone is willing. I also want to put a disclaimer that I know I am at a very healthy weight already, it is just a preference to lose weigh for me personally.

I am 5'1.5"" and weigh around 120lbs. Due to my height and proportions though, I look a lot bigger than I really am. I'm 25, and a few years ago I was around 100lbs before my body hit an unexpected 3rd puberty. I would ideally like to get back to this weight/somewhere around it. I know you cannot target fat loss, but I would love my upper arms, thighs, calves, and lower stomach region to tighten up. I'm scared of lifting because I don't want to build muscle and end up looking bigger since I am already on a small frame. I already have a bigger backside and thighs for my body, so ideally I don't want to build those up either. I stomach vacuum, and on good days you can see some ab lines poking through.

I don’t want to look bulky/muscular/or strong. I would ideally like to look thin and lean with skinny arms and legs. 

Last year when I was WFH and lived alone I was really good about counting calories and walking 10,000 steps a day and I saw some progress. I now don't have the time or energy to do what I did before, so I'm hoping an hour at the gym a few times a week can help instead.

 I am a dance teacher and take barre classes, so I am kind of active, but I just know for this challenge I will need to go to the gym. I eat a calorie conscious vegetarian diet that tends to bloat me occasionally, if this is helpful information. I just want to get out of this slump and feel confident in my body again.

I know those numbers may not seem like a big deal to some, but 147.6 just barely put me into the overweight category for my height. I had been steadily gaining weight since college and over my 5 years there I put on about 15 lbs. Then I graduated and the pandemic hit and I gained just under another 10. Once I saw that number, 147.6, I knew I had let it go too far and started to be more strict with my diet and exercise. In about 2 months I lost 15 lbs. I hit my original goal weight of 130 a few months ago, and have been STRUGGLING ever since to lose that final 3 that would put me at a round 20lbs lost.

Well I finally did it. I'm happy at this weight, but want to push myself and set one more goal to see if I can lose a little bit of extra chub around my back. I'm going to really push strength exercises too, which might cause me to stay at this weight because I'll gain in muscle, but I suppose my ultimate goal is to get down to 125lbs.

I've never posted in this sub before, but just wanted to share my little victory somewhere. 

My advice to anyone in a similar situation is to track your calorie intake with an app. It made it much easier for me to realize what was in the food I was eating, and even though I've stopped tracking, the information has stuck with me. Did you know freakin fortune cookies have 100 calories each?? I thought those things were maybe 20. ",1645020841.0

So, I've posted \~2 months ago with my weight loss plan and I have good news! I'm down 30lbs from 225 to 195.

Basically, I wake up and drink my caffeine, do \~1hr of biking, 30m HIIT session (3 days on 1 day off), then a 30 minute cooldown / walk. After that I drink a vile mix of 30g apple cider vinegar and 5g psyllium husk as an appetite suppressant, then eat breakfast and continue with my day as normal.

Here's the weird part though, I only really eat when I'm hungry and max out at about 1,800 - 2,000 calories consumed per day. Some days if I cut snacks I end up at 1,600. Compared to the 3,500 - 4,000 calories I burn per day according to my fitbit, I've literally been in a 1,500 - 2,000 calorie deficit every single day for 2 months.

Is this ok? I've been noticing an increase in performance on my HIIT and over-all feel stronger and lighter, less anxious / depressed, less winded. According to my smart scale most of the weight loss is fat, not muscle. The only downside is being a bit tired but that's it, I can offset that with standing at my desk and letting natural light into my office. Anyways, let me know your thoughts!",1645064565.0

Measures of success other than weight!!,10,stxpwf,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/stxpwf/measures_of_success_other_than_weight/,2,"Weight loss can be exciting, but I’ve made a list of other things that have improved for me over my journey and I thought I’d share to give others ideas of things to celebrate!! Sometimes a number on a scale is just so abstract it isn’t enough to keep a person going so here we go:

1. My feet stopped splitting open. This is gross, but my callouses on my feet used to pop open and bleed when they’d get dry and I could barely stay ahead of it and it was so painful. (I live somewhere arid). I read that it was about weight and didn’t think much of it but this year, it only happened once and it was very small!!!  Like seriously. 

2. No more chub rub. My legs are living together as peaceful neighbors now and it is amazing. 

3. My love handles are almost gone to the point I might consider a two piece this year. Like seriously. 

4. I went to a trampoline park with my kids and it was so much freaking fun. Do you know how much easier it is to jump almost 50 lbs down? Exercise in general just gets way more fun. 

5. I’m getting serious credit from others now, especially since I emerged from the pandemic way healthier than I’d previously been which was a miracle. 

6. Along with jumping, running around with my kids and chasing them or picking them up is way more possible. 

7. Obviously my other body measurements are all way down. 

8. I’ve found an entire new free wardrobe in the back of my closet in all the clothes that I kept that I can wear again!!

9. Since I went the slow way and taught myself how to eat and eat anything I want, just within CICO, I’m no longer afraid of food. It feels like cheating. I’m that person who goes to a party and has the donut and a bit of everything and still somehow loses weight. Cake still makes me cry for joy. 

10. I crave fruits and veggies now because I’ve learned how much better they make me feel and how supportive they are to my eating other less healthy things. 

11. My hubs who was only minorly overweight has lost a little just by being around me. 

12. My entire vocabulary is more positive. I don’t talk about junk food, healthy food, cheating failing etc etc. I talk about fun food, nourishing food, and things that weren’t supportive to my journey (oh well). I just don’t beat myself up anymore. 

13. I’m just way happier as a person. 

14. I used to think my bed was get torn less comfortable and old. Now it’s fine and I sleep better, no new bed purchase required.

15. My back doesn’t randomly hurt anymore just from living my life. 

16. I can sit up in a chair like a normal person without my stomach getting in the way.

I’ve always struggled with my weight but I was on the fast track to loosing weight when I was motivated to apply to Marine OCS.

(Pull ups were not my thing and my enlisted recruiter wasn’t a fan)

Anyway I enlisted in the Navy at 175lbs. Lost weight but I ended up being separated because I was diagnosed with BP1.

I lived in denial and gained weight.

Anyway, I weighed myself today and I was a 247.4. It’s disgusting. I need to change but I don’t know how or where to start. I was going to Burn Boot Camp but recently I lost my job (not for BP1). I’ve been working to find a new job while painting paintings for extra cash but I had to cut the gym. 

I just feel and I know that when I was trying to joint the military/police/EMS, I had a greater purpose. I wanted to be able pass the PRT, rescue people, run fast, carry people, ect.

I had surgery on my back about a year ago and they put me on steroids after the surgery. Due to the steroids and limited movement during recovery, I gained a lot of weight, 127 pounds exactly. My doctors cleared me in December to start working out and I’ve been going to the gym 4 days a week, waking up two hours early just to go and I’ve tried keto and intermittent fasting, along with regular diet and nothing has worked. The weight is not falling off like everyone said it would. In the gym, I do 40 minutes of treadmill, walking for 3 minutes, jogging for two. Then i either do the stairmaster or the row machine, per my trainers advice (yes i paid money for a trainer, i was that desperate). After that I do a variations of different machines or floor workouts, depending on the day. But nothing, I’ve lost 6 pounds and I’ve been doing this since December. Any advice??",1645049458.0
Should I focus on losing fat or gaining lean muscles now?,1,su7uty,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/su7uty/should_i_focus_on_losing_fat_or_gaining_lean/,2,"I'm 27F, 134lbs. My healthiest was in 2018 when I was at around 125lbs and I wanted to get back to that figure after getting an office job and gaining fat since 2019. Before that I went with keto (successfully lost 8lbs in 8 months) and was in a dance crew, and I didn't have a car so I walked and took public transport and that helped with keeping me active too.

Over the years, I've gained 10lbs, and my body fat percentage ballooned from 28-29% to 36% now. I did a DXA scan today and found out I don't have much visceral fat, which is good and assuring that all this extra fat I gained can be lost. My BMR is quite low at 1300, and my muscle mass is on the lowest end that can still be considered ""acceptable"" for women my age, so I know all these years of restrictive diets have eaten away at my lean muscles and ruined my metabolism.

I've been working out regularly with a PT for a month now, 3 strength days, 2 cardio days a week. My TDEE would be around 2000 based on average daily calories burned logged in my Apple Watch the past month and the BMR measured today. I've been tracking everything I eat religiously in the mean time, and I eat around 1300 - 1500 calories a day on a low carbs diet with at least 50g of protein a day. It's been a month of doing this - being concious of what I eat, working out regularly. I haven't lost any inches or lbs.

On one hand, I want to make sure I eat enough to gain more muscles and restore my metabolism, but on the other hand the 36% body fat just discourages me so much and makes me want to restrict to lose the fat. I'm afraid I'll gain even more fat if I eat more. I'm not sure what to do now. Any advices?",1645049316.0

Need advice on lack of self control with food/Endless weight loss cycles,1,su1kyw,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/su1kyw/need_advice_on_lack_of_self_control_with/,2,"My entire life I've been obese. It hit its worst point in my senior year of high school where I ended up  peaking at 275 pounds. I'm a 22 year old girl, about 5'7. This has been really hard for me mentally and I feel like for the past 6 years I've been on a constant failing weight loss journey, except for when I was in college. I went to school in the city and ended up adjusting my diet to the meal plan that my school had. I was walking a lot more and had a consistent sleeping schedule. My first year of college I went from 275 pounds -> 245 pounds. I was so proud of myself. From my sophomore year to junior year, I went from 245 pounds -> 200. I've never been so happy with myself my entire life. I felt like I was on top of the world. My mental health has been extremely correlated with how I feel about myself physically and this was just amazing for me.

Then the pandemic hit. I had to move home where I couldn't walk anywhere (I live in the suburbs) and my mom was constantly making desserts and buying junk food. Every week she would go to Krispy Kreme and buy a dozen donuts for me and my sister and she and my step dad wouldn't eat any of them. I've had really awful self control when it comes to food and the reason that I lost so much weight in college is due to me making sure that there was no junk food in my dorm/apartment that I could be tempted by. I would beg my mom to stop buying this food if she wasn't going to be eating it and that it was just meant for me and my sister, but she wouldn't. Being less active and having to deal with all of that ended up pushing me to gain a lot of weight back.. probably around 35 pounds. Seeing how happy and healthy I could be at 200 pounds and then getting pushed back to a weight that I was unhappy with really put a toll on my mental health. 

Since this point, I've consistently been trying to get back to 200 pounds. I'll go in a calorie deficit and work out for weeks on end and then one weekend I'll have a slip-up and my progress will be set back to square one. Ex: since mid-January I've been counting my calories and working out. I lost 10 pounds and this weekend I went to my girlfriend's house to celebrate her birthday/the super bowl. I didn't track my calories because her mom made us food most of the weekend and I had no idea what the value of our meals were. I had so much access to unhealthy food that I ended up going a little overboard and eating more junk food than I should've.

I just weighed myself and the 10 pounds that I took weeks and weeks losing are right back on. I feel completely worthless and like I put in all of that effort for absolutely no reason. I have no one to hold me accountable, when I expressed to my girlfriend how I felt she told me to go easier on myself and stop tracking calories. She thinks it's pointless and that I should eat whatever I want to but I don't think she understands how little self control I have. I have no idea how to maintain self control when it comes to food. I can start fresh at square one and start counting my calories and working out yet again, but I feel like I'm going to be in this endless cycle forever. It's making me extremely depressed which is leading to me feeling unmotivated, thus not feeling like working out or leaving the house (which is also having it's negative effects and sending me deeper in the cycle) Has anyone dealt with anything similar? How did you manage to break the cycle or manage your lack of self control?",1645032826.0

So basically, I’m very active and eat very healthily. I play tennis 5 days a week and I’m currently training for a half marathon. Food wise, I eat pretty healthily. I rarely drink, don’t do any sugar drinks, rarely drink any alcohol, don’t do sweets or carb heavy foods, etc. And for the most part, I lose weight. It’s usually around 3 lbs/week. 

However, whenever I stray off a little, I gain stupid amounts of weight. Perfect example is Super Bowl Sunday. I’m not gonna sit here you tell you that I was calorie conscious or anything. I logged out and knew I was gonna gain a pound or two. However, the morning of, I did an hour of cardio tennis and then ran half marathon distance for my training. Well over 30,000 steps, 20 miles, 3000 calories burned (according to my watch). Figured that would at least offset some of the weight gain. 

Stepped on the scale yesterday morning and gained 8 pounds. My wife thinks that considering my level of activity, there’s no way I should gain that amount of weight in a single day. I had talked to my GP about this in the past and she was also shocked at my weight gain, ran a thyroid test, and it came back fine. Should I maybe go see a specialist? Or just accept that I’m gonna gain stupid amounts of weight if I decide to pig out for a special occasion (which isn’t ideal because I like to be able to do something with friends every once in awhile without worrying about undoing weeks of work).",1644974244.0

Weight loss still leads to family commenting on what I eat and I'm sick of it,1,stpw9s,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/stpw9s/weight_loss_still_leads_to_family_commenting_on/,5,"This is going to come across as a bit of a rant but I would like advice and I really hope this is the right place for it, sorry in advanced if it isn't. 

Around June last year I'd tipped over to an ""overweight"" BMI so I decided to work on weightloss and by November I'd gotten to a healthy weight category for my age/height, and I love how I feel. I didn't cut out any foods, except I have a huge sweet tooth so instead I did a lot of research and found many healthy alternatives that satisfied any sugar cravings that arose and figured out how my body responded whenever I ate such foods and at what times. For example, I found that whenever I ate dark chocolate or cacao for breakfast (along with fruits, oats, etc.), I wouldn't crave sugar for the rest of the day (this is relevant later). I'm still a little away from my weight-goal but my biggest focus is to be as healthy as possible to reach it.

Cut to my mother who constantly makes snarky, judgy comments on any of my food choices, even the healthy ones which she sees as unhealthy. She has made jokes/comments about my size, weight and how much I was eating my whole life to the point that up until I actually was overweight, I genuinely believed I was fat despite being a size 6/8 (US size 2/4) my whole life. She would make joke guesses about my weight, often shooting for several kilos higher than my actual weight, and at one point forced me to get my blood-sugar checked and when the machine showed it was fine, she questioned the machine. These comments have triggered me into some very unhealthy weight-loss attempts in the past.

Yet even now, at a healthy weight, she still makes these comments. Last night I'd made some cacao-overnight oats with chia, berries and topped with cacao greek yogurt (totalling in 376cal and high in macros) for breakfast. The whole thing was about 3 tablespoons of oats mixed with 1 teaspoon choc protein powder and 1/2 teaspoon cacao + 2 teaspoons of yogurt mixed with 1/4 teaspoon cacao i.e. very small and I assembled it in a small juice glass.  
I forgot to add - my mum is a diabetic whose spent the last few years reducing the amount of sugar she eats so that anything (even tea with a teaspoon of sugar) comes across as sweet to her. This morning while I was eating she told me she'd tried some of my oats and it was so sweet and wondered why on earth I was eating this giant amount of chocolate for breakfast. I tried to tell her it was cacao and the whole thing had less than a teaspoon of processed sugar, but she kept telling me I was wrong and I shouldn't be eating so unhealthy. She then questions leftovers of a mocha protein shake that I'd made that morning and left in the fridge and when I try to explain again that it's a healthy choice, she ignores me and says ""We tried so hard to raise you with healthy eating habits and then you go around and try things like this. I don't know where we went wrong with you.""

On the surface, I know that she doesn't know what she's talking about and that this is who she is - someone who jumps to conclusions and refuses to believe she is in the wrong. But my issue is every time she says things like this about the foods I eat, it triggers me to no longer want to eat that food. I'd been obsessed with this overnight-oats recipe; I'd been eating it twice a week for the last 2 months because it tastes amazing and leaves me feeling full and energised, but now, I can't even explain why, but these comments make me never want to eat it again. I can't get my body and mind to listen to each other even though foods like this helped my weight loss so far and I know it. Even my instagram feed, which now has an oats-recipes thread, made me feel sick just scrolling. I hate that I let these comments get to me but I can't help it, and this isn't the first time it's happened either.

I guess I would like advice on how to deal with situations like this. How do I overcome family members making snarky comments like this on foods that I eat? Is what I'm eating actually healthy? Just how can I remind myself that this system worked for me and that comments like this shouldn't mean anything?",1644996114.0

Healthy Weight Loss through BMR/AMR/Exercise,1,stm3k6,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/stm3k6/healthy_weight_loss_through_bmramrexercise/,1,"I know this is a reduction, but let's say one is trying to lose weight based on a 300-500 daily calorie deficiency. When trying to understand how to build in that deficiency, and understands the exact number of calories. burned in exercise, which equation would be most accurate?

Calorie Expenditure = BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) + Exercise Calories

Calorie Expenditure = AMR (Active Metabolic Rate - Sedentary/Little Exercise) + Exercise Calories

I figured that if you know the ""exact"" number of calories burned in exercise, do you just use BMR and add to that (but that doesn't account for taking kids to soccer games, shopping, going to get my dog, etc). So would you be better off using a sedentary AMR number and then adding exercise on top of that?

In the last 10 months, I have recovered from an eating disorder and have gained some weight. I personally think it’s a bit too much-  think 40lbs (18kg). It’s not that I was too skinny before- my bmi was low but not underweight. Its just that I achieved my goal the wrong way.

I would like to lose some fat and gain muscle but I’m having trouble. I’m on a medication that’s supposed to be taken with 20-50 grams of fat. I’m not sure if thats a lot? I’ll quickly show you what my diet has looked like these last few days so you have a general idea of what I eat. 

I wake up late so I usually have breakfast/lunch as a combined meal. I have 1 large honey crisp apple, 1/2 cup low fat cottage  cheese, container of noops oatmilk pudding, and a honey mamas oregon mint truffle bar. Today I had a leftover slice of grilled halloumi as well. I always drink a few cups of water with this meal. Then I take my meds. 

This meal is very high in fat. On the low end it’s around 25grams of fat. Today, because of the cheese, it was about 40 grams of fat. I also like to eat a very big breakfast/lunch because it prevents me from bingeing on dinner. 

I guess all Im wondering is that- is fat bad for weight loss? I know there are different kinds of fat that are good and some are worse for you. Im not sure if Im consuming the wrong kind of fat. Any suggestions of how to improve my meal? I appreciate it a lot thank you!",1644963763.0

How do you deal with cravings and binges?,2,starva,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/starva/how_do_you_deal_with_cravings_and_binges/,5,"So I already lost some kgs, I have fluctuated for the last years due to mental health problems. I ate like shit, drank more alcohol, was on antidepressants and didn't have the energy to work out consistently because of those problems. My weight was at an all time high at 72kg, now I'm at 65kg. I want to lose another 5kg because that's what my weight always was since I'm an adult, 60kg (132lbs) at 164cm (5'4). I'm not overweight, but want to lose those last kgs. 

I eat 1400 calories a day, but I'm always thinking about food. It's fine during the day but in the evening (like right now) I'm so 'hungry' and want to just order a pizza and some icecream. Most days I don't, and I wait for the weekend. But the problem with that is that I look forward to the weekend just so I can 'let loose' and eat more than 1400 calories for one day (sometimes two) and then I just eat high calorie foods for most of the day and drink alcohol when I have something socially. Which results in me maintaining my weight right now instead of losing (not gaining either so that's something I guess lol). 

I'm just tired of feeling hungry during the week, 'bingeing' and drinking on the weekends (mostly one day, sometimes two), feeling guilty afterwards and not losing anything for months. 

How did you solve this problem? How can I resist to stuff myself in the weekends? I know part of it is willpower and I'm just weak or feeling depressed and I don't care anymore in that moment (and then feel depressed afterwards because I feel guilty and weak).

So I am a female who is weighing 93kg and 5ft 7inches tall and I am 20 years

I’ll avoid a long story but I’ve always been overweight and have always started my weightlosss journey and failed continuously I mostly loose a few kgs of weight or sometimes water weight and then get back to eating and gain back all the weight.
So mostly I do this by counting calories I know everything about CD and I am accurate and everything and I know how to do it it’s just that I am not consistent and disciplined I loose my motivation after some time, so I know my problems

So last two weeks I went on another weight loss journey and this time I decided to eat 1500calories per day even though according to my tdee calculator I couldn’t eat more than that and I wasn’t in a hurry I wasn’t expecting any magical change in any month I looked at all my failures of the past  and found a way to avoid them I achieved the calorie deficit while eating food I liked in moderation while measuring them out with a scale and using my fitness pal I wasn’t starving myself everything was going fine. I was in the right space mentally I knew I wasn’t going to be perfect all the days but I knew I should have more of a majority. I did this for 2 weeks I didn’t achieve a CD for like 3 days out of the 2 weeks and it wasn’t a binge just a slight increase in calories and I lost some water weight

But something happened in my life that took me off track and I couldn’t keep track anymore so for the next 2weeks including today I was off track wasn’t counting calories and sometimes bing eating so I want to know have I lost all that my progresss of 2 weeks ago and do you think I have gained much fat and weight in these 2 weeks I don’t want to check a scale

And how do you think I came get back on track thank you

Here’s how I’ve lost 16 pounds over the last two months eating whatever I want with minimal exercise,136,ssiiwg,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/ssiiwg/heres_how_ive_lost_16_pounds_over_the_last_two/,38,"I’m a 27 y/o male who has been slightly overweight for a long time. I’ve tried various “diets” over the years (low carb, cut out sugar, no eating out, etc.) and have never been able to stick with them. This is the first time I’ve found a plan that is working consistently AND I’m easily able to keep up. Obviously everyone is different, but I’m sharing this to hopefully help some folks similar to me.  

It’s true I eat whatever I want. The big difference is that I don’t eat as MUCH as I want. Quantity is key here. I’ll discuss this more further down. 

I simply log everything I take into my body in a calorie tracking app. Initially, I set up my starting weight, target weight, and how much I wanted to lose each week and the app figures out how many calories I’m allowed. (I use MyFitnessPal and love it, but any similar app will work as long as you have one.)

I attribute my success in this plan to two key points. The first: not trying to limit what foods I eat. In the past, I tried low carb for example, and all I wanted was carbs. This eventually broke me and I abandoned the plan altogether. Now, I’m not limiting myself as far as types of food, I just pay much closer attention to portions. For example, instead of grabbing the whole box of cheez-it’s and taking it with me to eat lunch, I count out a serving or two. I still ate what I wanted, but I didn’t overeat by losing track of how many times I reached in the box for another handful (it’s easy to do). When I received a shipment of cookies (which I love) around the holidays, I would be more conservative with my meals throughout the day so I had enough calories left in the evening for a cookie or two. It’s all about budgeting. After a while, you start to automatically look for serving size on packages and size your portion accordingly. It’s okay to not be ultra precise. Just get it as close as you can - you’ll overestimate sometimes and underestimate sometimes. It’ll all average out over time. Which brings me to my second point…

It’s okay to go over your limit. This is the biggest reason I’ve been able to stick with this! You HAVE to accept that you’re going to go over sometimes and it’s not a failure. 

Friday night, you’re watching a movie and want to eat a whole pizza? Do it. Your friends invite you out for drinks and you want to drink 10 beers? Drink ‘em (don’t drive home, please). You’re going to go over your calorie limit sometimes, and that’s okay. When this happens, just get back on track the next day and DON’T VIEW IT AS A FAILURE. The dangerous mindset is “well I already went over yesterday, might as well eat as much as I want today too.”

It’s far more important to stick with this over the long term as opposed to being perfect every day. No, this isn’t a “get slim fast” scheme, but to use the cliche, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. The way to ensure you finish the marathon is by not making yourself hate the diet. 

I recently went on a long weekend trip with some friends. Guess what? I went over my limit every day we were there. When I got home, I didn’t kick myself over it and picked right back up where I left off.

One other thing that’s motivating to me: try to find an app where you can log your weight daily and see it on a graph over time. Progress is an excellent driver to keep going. Note that there will be some upward trends in your graph. This is completely normal - don’t let it discourage you. After you’ve logged for a while, you’ll see the general downward trend and want to keep it moving that way. 

As long as you adopt the mindset of being aware of your intake, log everything in your app, and stick to your limit more often than not, you’ll be successful. It might even be easier than you think.

Best of luck to you. Happy to help in any way I can.",1644865674.0

Neither of us have ever gone to a gym outside of what our schools offered through P.E. class.

C recently came to me and said that she's been on this new medication prescribed by her doctor that's been making her have an abundance of energy, and apparently its taken away her feeling of hunger almost entirely. And though it has apparently made her drop a couple pounds in just a few weeks, she wants to help the process along by going to the gym. She asked me to do this with her, mainly because we're both about the same size, and because we're always together anyway.

I've bought us a gym membership this morning, and we plan on starting later this week.

To put it out there, we both have limitations.

She had an accident playing badminton almost three years ago, in which her leg basically exploded. Tore her ACL, broke her femur, and something with her miniscus? She went through PT and a handful of surgeries, and then re-exploded everything when she slipped into a mole hole in her yard like a year later. On top of that, she's since developed arthritis in that knee. She's had a seriously rough way to go, and she walks with a serious limp now.

My immune system is trash because I grew up in a damn trap house that nobody kept clean, and my lungs don't work the best because on top of my weight, my parents have been chain smokers since I was born and, not joking, I had bronchitis like every other month for almost 9 years until we moved to a house that wasn't ridden with lead and asbestos. Due to being sick all the time, I wasn't allowed to go out even if I could, and I found comfort in our pantry full of snacks until I was about 14 and 230lbs. That being said, cardio isn't easy on either of us lol

Why do people say skipping breakfast makes you eat more? Eating breakfast always makes me hungrier.,374,ss5xog,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/ss5xog/why_do_people_say_skipping_breakfast_makes_you/,82,"Like the title says. I see so many experts preaching that skipping breakfast is bad- and not because of anything to do with health, but because it makes you hungrier later on. That's it. That's the argument. Nothing about it affecting your health. The thing is, I could understand it if that were the case. Skipping meals can't ever be the healthiest option. So I'd understand if these people were claiming it's bad for your body to skip breakfast. But nope- just makes you more likely to cheat your diet, according to most experts.

Here's my problem with that. On the rare occasion I DO eat breakfast, it just makes me hungrIER, earlier. Every time I eat breakfast, I find myself having to essentially starve at the end of the day because I'm so hungry during that I spend over half of my calories by lunchtime, or I feel physically sick during the day because my body is SO HUNGRY when, had I skipped breakfast, I wouldn't be hungry at all.

As someone with lots of experience with failed diets, I've found I have to be very picky when I go about it, or it doesn't work. I prefer to savor my food since I know I can't have much of it, and something scarfing down a breakfast I don't feel like eating (makes me nauseous when I've just woken up) and wasting 300-400 calories on something that will just make me hungrier later on just doesn't sit well with me. Go figure.

I get that SOME people might eat better when they eat breakfast, but it bothers me that experts use this as a universal guideline.

Does anyone else have this issue?? Or am I just a freak with a confused digestive system?",1644828113.0

If you’re having trouble losing weight… try this,13,sslhiw,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sslhiw/if_youre_having_trouble_losing_weight_try_this/,2,"I see so many people here post about how they work out 4-5 times a week and eat right but still can’t seem to lose weight. Others talk about how they cut so much from their diet but it’s not making a difference. 

There is only one reason that can explain why you are not losing weight (excluding rare medical conditions and assuming you have calculated the right BMR for your body), you’re not counting right. You won’t believe how many mistakes people make when they count/track their calories. For example, sometimes people don’t count oil (which is about 80cals per 2 teaspoons) when cooking, or sometimes they don’t use a food weight scale and rather guesstimate portion sizes. Losing weight is a simple math equation. Calories in &lt; calories out. If your expending more calories than your taking in, then mathematically, scientifically, and unequivocally you should be losing weight. 

Try being super vigilant tracking calories for a month and if you see no change, time to see a doctor. 

Some tips to tracking calories accurately: 


- Count everything. No exceptions, apart from water of course. If something is 0 calories such as a Diet Coke, track it because it’ll help you see your nutrition. 

- Trust the package always. Sometimes calorie tracking apps give you a totally different number than the package you scan. Idk why this happens but always trust the package. 

- Avoid eating out or from places that you can’t get accurate nutritional information

 


Another thing that helped me kick off my journey was to just focus on diet. The first 3 months all I did was track calories. I spent maybe 3 hours a week total walking ( this is the recommended amount to “stay healthy”), other than that, no gym, no treadmill, nothing. This helped focus my efforts and learn the ins and outs of nutrition and diet so when I added exercise it didn’t overwhelm me or burn me out. They say abs are made in the kitchen for a reason. 


Once you get a hang of counting calories, the sky’s the limit.",1644873026.0

In 2019 I lost 20kg and was so close to 109 (a big goal for me) but for varying bad choices, anxiety and a job change, I gained it all back. I let excuses get in the way.

I'm a school teacher with an interesting but sedentary job. I live where I teach (very remote), and a cook/food is provided to me and other staff. I can't control the food (what type or measuring - so can't calorie track) provided so I'm trying to focus on portion sizes and choosing the healthier options (that are possible). I'm adding in daily walking (20 mins to start) and trying to cut out alcohol (heavy drinking culture) and snacks (lots of sweets and chips readily available).  
I planned about a month ago to start a challenge for the school term focussing on my movement, food, drinking and money spending. I've created a chart for me to colour in (visual person), with different categories Green, Yellow and Orange, all with guidelines on what each colour means for each category for a 42 day challenge. I started just by tracking and now I have started my challenge and but I don't want to fizzle out. 

I know motivation doesn't last forever, that it takes discipline. But what are some tactics you have used to stay motivated and learn discipline? Would love some visual tactics especially! And any other tips you might have, considering my job/lifestyle?

Weight Loss Question,1,ssftww,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/ssftww/weight_loss_question/,3,"So I am 28 in a week and very focused on weight loss rn. I’ve been doing a good job, I started orange theory on dec 21 and have lost about 25lbs since then. My question is about loose skin. So my starting weight was about 248-250 and my goal weight is 175. That is not the whole story though. I’ve struggled with my weight for a very long time and this is not the first time I’ve lost weight. Due to depression, anxiety, etc, I’ve always gained it back. I’m finally mentally ready to keep the weight off but even though this time I started at 250 that’s not my highest weight. When I was a senior in high school I got to 280. Before deciding to lose weight and getting down to about 200lbs. Over a couple years I gained that 80lbs back and more. Eventually reaching over 300lbs. I don’t remember the highest exactly but somewhere in the 320 range. In 2017 I ended up losing that weight and getting down to 245 and then gaining some weight back again hitting 285 by 2020. In 2020 I lost 65lbs, gained 25lbs back and then caught myself that time and realized I had to stop the cycle. It was the first time when I gained some weight back and instead of giving up I dug back in. However now that I’m roughly 225 I’m concerned as I move forward with how my skin will be. I know it’ll be better than not losing the weight at all and I know everyone is different but could anyone give me some realistic expectations. What made me thing about this is my stomach currently. When I’m fat my stomach really sticks out hut now it’s hanging more and I was worried that this might be because the skin is loose. Let’s say I manage to get to 175-185 by December, should I expect loose skin? Is it possible with that amount of weight that it’ll eventually revert naturally?",1644859014.0

Having outfits that made me feel good helped me with weightloss.,24,srtg1p,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/srtg1p/having_outfits_that_made_me_feel_good_helped_me/,2,"This may sound odd, but before I invested into some cute outfits that I felt comfortable in, I felt awful at the gym. I felt like I looked disgusting and I felt like other people saw me that way too. Id show up to the gym in an old t shirt that had stains on it because I thought why not since I’m gonna sweat in it anyways, an old gross hoodie, leggings with holes, dirty gross white shoes. As gross as I felt wearing that, I was too scared to buy those cute outfits that girls wear because I was scared what others would think since I wasn’t in shape. This made me less motivated to go to the gym because I hated going there just to feel ugly. I saw a TikTok ad of a gym set and I loved it but I scrolled passed it because I thought I was too “fat” for it. I came to the realization that I don’t care anymore and I wanted to start dressing cute because I know it would make me feel good. I went to the mall and put together a gym outfit that I felt good in. I found a cute pair of leggings that actually made my butt look good which I didn’t know was possible, a cropped black t-shirt (I always tried to stray away from wearing cropped things because I was scared what people would think), and I got a new pair of sneakers. The feeling of having a new outfit to wear to the gym made me so excited to go the next day. When I put it on getting ready for the gym I felt a little nervous but I felt cute for once. Although I didn’t have the flattest stomach or the biggest butt it was better than wearing what I used to wear. I showed up to the gym and I was anxious but once I realized no one cared what I looked like, I calmed down and I had the best workout of my life that day, I felt so motivated. Moral of the story, don’t be afraid to wear the things you want at the gym, feeling hot at the gym can make you excited to start going more often. You don’t have to wear a bra and leggings or super tight clothes that you don’t feel comfortable in, just find something that feels right for you!",1644787556.0

how I've managed to 'enjoy the process',12,srwd4l,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/srwd4l/how_ive_managed_to_enjoy_the_process/,5,"I remember I used to rock up to work with my chicken and broccoli.

Obviously looking gutted because it's the 7th meal in the row I've brought to work. My co-worker would always say 'gotta keep grinding' or 'enjoy the process'.

I've always had a problem with this term. I never truly understood it. I mean what is the process?

Is losing weight and getting healthy meant to be enjoyable???

Well after yo-yoing back and forth with my weight and a hell lot of mistakes  it turns out it can, and it should.

**Mistake 1/ Numbers matter for weight loss, but it goes beyond that**

Part of my lack of patience and enjoyment of the process was because I was SUPER focused on the numbers. Whether the weight on the scales, speed on the treadmill or plates on the barbell. I soon learnt this journey is really about a transformation. Not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. Chasing the numbers stripped all of this.

**Mistake 2/ Neglecting the non-measurable stuff**

Again it stemmed from the numbers. So much I would almost disregard the other pillars of health. Like getting enough sleep, managing my stress (especially work related) and actually ENJOYING spending time with my friends and family. I would always feel anxious or cautious about hanging out with them in fears of having to break my 'diet'. Later in this post I'll talk about how I've managed this. But these pillars are JUST as important if not more. If you don't get enough sleep (quality too) aren't managing your stress, it plays a HUGE factor on how well and IF you exercise and eat healthy.

It's only after a bit of reflection and a hell lot of work which I've come to realise these mistakes. Definitely recommend spending some time thinking about this too!

Anyways, what did I learn from all this?

After lots and lots of tries I've distilled these learnings into 3 concepts which might help.

**Concept 1/ Establish an identity based goal**

If you felt hyperfocused and hyperobsessive on chasing the numbers and it hasn't really quite worked yet. OR maybe you've yo-yoed with your weight swap out the outcome-based goal of weight (just as example) for something based on who you are.

A question I like to ask myself - Who's the person I want to become? What would they be doing? On a daily, weekly, monthly basis.

**Concept 2/ Long term outlook for long term results**

What would absolutely butcher any enjoyment of the process were the short lapses in food (aka cheat meal... or meals) or skipping a gym workout. It's probably part of the all or nothing mentality, but what's helped me is to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

Will having pizza tonight really ruin my progress? Will skipping the gym this one time really stop me from seeing results?

Obviously you don't want to go over board with this. But it takes those short lapses or what I like to call enjoying life and helping you to feel less guilty and shameful about it all.

If you think about it, it'll just be a small blip in your whole journey of becoming a fitter, stronger version of yourself (definitely works well with concept 1).

**Concept 3/ Patience isn't just about sticking one thing**

I stumbled across this idea from another redditor and it really stuck.

Flip the switch on patience. It's not about being disciplined to one single thing. It's just your ability of **inaction.**

You've probably had 1000s of recommendations to try keto or intermittent fasting or to get into high intensity interval training.

What made the process unbearable was stopping and starting different things without giving one thing a good shot.

Going a mile deep rather than a mile wide. So when trying to enjoy the process,I encourage you to think about NOT jumping from one shiny thing to another.

**But don't just take my word for it**

I've found blindly following someone's how tos or advice like this not entirely the best approach. What's worked best for me is actually 'stealing' it for yourself. Not copy - big difference.

Find and experiment with any of the nuggets you get from this, tweak it to make it fit for you and your situation. Integrate it into your routine.

Would love to find out how you enjoy your process right now?

Hope you found this helpful!",1644795617.0

Since then, I’ve lost 52 pounds in 10 months, going from 226 to 174. I found an exercise program online that I actually enjoy and track my calories. I use a few different calculators online to get an idea of what my BMR are and how many calories I should be consuming. I also use an Apple Watch to keep track of activity and estimated resting energy. Every 6 weeks or some, I refigure the numbers and adjust from there. I started my deficit by consuming 1800 calories a day in April.

Anyway, my question comes down to this: should I or do I need to up my intake? I’m currently consuming about 1550 calories a day (based off a few calculators in order to lose the last 25 by my birthday in June), but I find myself hungry fairly often at the end of the day. I’m wondering if I need to be eating more. I’ve been tired and anxious and just don’t feel like myself. I’ve been around this 1550 number since the beginning on January, but find myself going over a few times a week because I’m legitimately hungry. 

For reference, I follow different plans within the program I participate in. Most plans are 2-3 weeks with videos for 5-6 days/week. Each video is usually 30-45 minutes long, with options to add suggested shorter sessions at the end (usually an additional 10-15 minutes).

Need to lose a lot of weight.,5,srygku,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/srygku/need_to_lose_a_lot_of_weight/,7,"Initially posted somewhere else but it may be more appropriate here.

Title is an understatement, I am M(39) and a week ago I was 425 lbs. I've known for a very long time I needed some radical life changes, I don't want to get into that here.  After a year of researching, planning and just plain procrastinating, I went on a whole food vegan diet about a week ago.  

So far I have not had many problems with hunger or cravings, I did tell myself that if I was hungry, I would eat something, though it would only be unprocessed natural foods.  For example I was hungry last night so I had about a half cup of unsalted almonds.  All in all I have been pleasantly surprised how easy it has been so far. 

My diet consists of a chickpeas (hummus and other various forms), spinach, sweet potatoes, beets, edamame, black beans, quinoa, fruits such as bananas, strawberries, blueberries, clementines.  I also use peanut butter, almond butter with almond milk for smoothies. Other various nuts, legumes and seeds too.  Very little bread, wheat when I do. For dessert before bed I'll have a cup of coconut milk yogurt with about a half cup of thawed blueberries on occasion. This is not all inclusive and I will probably slowly branch out but you get the idea.

An example of a typical dinner, last night I made chana masala, one of my favorite indian dishes.  I had a cup of that with a cup of quinoa. 

It is a very restrictive diet, but again, I haven't had much problems with hunger or cravings.  I am aiming for about 1800 calories a day, but it probably sometimes creeps to 2000.

I expected to lose a lot of water weight at first, I lost about 10 lbs in 2 days. But from what I know this diet, about a 1000 calorie deficit from my BMR, should take off about 2 lbs a week, which is what I want.  However this is so far not what I'm seeing.  After the initial 10 lbs, I have consistently lost about 0.5 to 1 lb a day. I'm worried that could be problematic and unhealthy.  Should I just increase portion size?  Even if I'm full which I often am?  Or is this still just shedding water weight?

Another surprising thing, sorry kinda gross, I expected to be pooping more, but I'm actually pooping less, once a day.  I do not feel constipated at all, there just seems to not be a lot in there.

Also, there are tons of advice online on what supplements to take on this diet.  I started taking b12 and D3 supplements, I'm not sure if I need to add calcium, iron, and Omega3 to it. 

Hopefully soon I will add some light exercise too, walking at first, but I'm not there yet, I cannot walk too far anyhow.",1644802365.0

My ideal weight would be around 80 - 85 kgs (back to how I kinda was at 20 - 21)

I recently moved back with my parents. They aren't the most healthy eaters. I try to gym around 3 -4 times a week but haven't seen much change/difference in the past 3 months. I'm currently trying to cut back on alcohol. I think I might be eating too much meat, sugar, snacks. I'm also rather unsure about calorie intake and how to estimate that properly. What would you do? the guys recommend proper estimation of calorie intake/foods to try to avoid.

The healthiest I have been was when vegan/vegetarian. But I've been really struggling to go back to that, even harder now living with my parents. Wanting to be healthier again and gain back my independence because I'm getting closure to 25 now. That hospo job I did completely crippled my health/wellbeing and I've really struggled to come back from that one.",1644818164.0

Can't lose weight under calorie deficit,0,ss5x6e,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/ss5x6e/cant_lose_weight_under_calorie_deficit/,1,"32 yo / 183cm / 82kg / Sedentary

A couple of years back I've managed to lose about 10kg and last summer I weighted about 78kg. During this winter, I picked up some bad habits (such as having desserts or sweet treats after meals) and picked up a few kgs again. 

It's been about a month now that I'm on a calorie deficit and I can't seem to lose that extra weight. My boyfriend (38 yo / 176cm / 73kg / Daily gym go-er) managed to lose his extra weight in almost no time (about 3/4kgs). 

Is activity the missing piece of the puzzle? I am asking because last time I lost all the extra weight I did not excercise and my understanding is that excercising has little to do with weight loss (and in some instances is also advise to avoid if weight loss is the goal). 

I'm frustrated because I was in great shape this summer and although it's just a couple of extra KGs I want to get rid of them!

I track my calories and my macros daily - my goal is 1743 calories/day and most of days I don't even hit that with 200/300 calories missing every day. When I go over I do so by about 50/100 calories. 

Would love to hear your opinion on what I'm doing wrong!",1644828049.0

I’ve been doing mild exercise for now. Just sort of walking around the area talking the dog for a walk for like 20 minutes a day. I really don’t mind exercise. I almost call myself like a fat fit person just because I have no problem with doing exercises(I know it’s stupid).

It just concerns me that I will wind up going from a body I'm unhappy with right into another one I'm still unhappy with.

constant struggle to lose weight,1,srrpdd,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/srrpdd/constant_struggle_to_lose_weight/,2,"I have never been a particularly healthy weight, but I've certainly been healthier in the past than I am now. At my lowest, I weighed around 73kg, 5 years ago. Now I weigh 94 almost 95kg. I am 162cm, so we can see my weight has never really been in the healthiest area. 

I've had depression in the past and have suffered anxiety and I know a lot of my eating came from emotional eating. I also think I can pinpoint when I started gaining weight, which is when I settled down with my now husband. I have gained over 20kg since we have been together. He has noticed and mentioned it and has asked me to be careful, for my health. We are long distance for the time being and we actually have very different bodies so going on a diet together would actually be difficult I think. He can eat everything and hardly gain a thing. I so much as smell a slice of cake and that's it, I've inhaled the calories. I am active in my job, I am always walking and carrying heavy equipment and always busy, but losing weight is the hardest thing in the world for me, whereas gaining weight is the easiest. 

I try to be healthy and throughout the day I can manage it, but after I've made my dinner I just want to eat more and more and more and sometimes I just can't stop myself. I'll eat anything in the cupboard. I try to buy the healthier options but I am on a very low budget at the moment and find that the healthier options can often be the more expensive ones. I know for me, I need to exercise to lose weight. I could starve myself and lose weight, but not a lot because my metabolism is incredibly slow, I gain it back so fast. However I don't have time for the gym, nor can I really afford to join one yet. I live in a upper floor flat, I just have one neighbour below me, but if I were to do exercise in the house I would need to try to keep quiet for her, no jumping jacks for example. It is a carpeted floor, but it's an old home and the flooring can be quite squeaky, I guess, in some places. I don't know a lot of exercise I could do, if anyone could help with this? 

I live in the north of England so it's very cold and wet a lot of the time especially in this time of year. I would love to go for walks but it is very cold or raining or there's too much wind and it just puts me off. I would struggle anyway with walking too far or jogging as I have a torn cartilage and ligament in my knee which can cause me some trouble sometimes. 

I'm just wondering if anyone knows any exercises I could do or anything I could do with helping to lose weight? And how I can keep my motivation up? 

I would like to add. I don't eat a lot of meat. I'm not a vegetarian, I just simply don't like meat a lot and tend to learn towards the vegetarian options. So I'm wondering if I need to add more protein into my diet? I find often even if I eat a lot of healthy food, I feel hungrier compared to if I ate the same amount or less in unhealthy food. I could eat half a packet of cookies and feel content for a while compared to if I ate a whole punnet of grapes, where I'd be hungry again in a couple of minutes. Is this normal when going on a diet? 

Thank you for any help

I have changed my eating habits so that I am eating a more balance diet and have halved my portion size.

I am currently doing 30 mins a day, 5-6 days a week. 20 mins of strength and 10 mins of HIIT (20 second intervals with 10 second recovery). My strength workouts are varied through out the week so that I’m not focusing too much on one area of my body.

I suppose my main questions are;

Should I be doing more?
Should I swap my timing round so that I do more HIIT than strength.
Is there anything else I can that has worked for you?

I’m a 37 year old male who has lost almost 40 pounds since October (85 pounds total from my highest point in 2019!) and things are going great. I’m using MyFitnessPal, I do a walk on the treadmill 3-5 times a week, and my blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate are all great.

I just had the Gastric Sleeve surgery. Need advice/words of encouragement.,7,srbl8m,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/srbl8m/i_just_had_the_gastric_sleeve_surgery_need/,11,"For a quick background, I’m a 19 year old girl and I’ve been fat my whole life. At my highest weight which is just recently I weighed 400 pounds (give or take). Talking about my struggles with obesity is extremely difficult for me, so I’m coming to a place where I can write it all out and hopefully I’ll be able to be real and truthful.

If you don’t know what the Gastric Sleeve surgery is I’ll briefly explain it. Basically the surgeons remove part of your stomach and join the remaining parts together to make a “sleeve”. The new stomach is about 1/10th of the original size of the stomach. After having this procedure you physically can’t eat as much as you used to and you get full quicker.

I wasn’t super excited about having it done but my mom got the surgery about a year ago and has been doing really well. I decided to go through with it and I just had it done four days ago. I’m at home now and recovering. It is so much harder than I imagined it would be.

I’ve always had problems with binging food. Especially at night. Late at night around midnight or one AM I would go to the kitchen and eat an assortment of different things until I finally felt full. A package of ramen noodles, a bowl of cereal, a bag of popcorn, a hot pocket, chips, and probably even more things all in one sitting. I didn’t do it every single night but it happened often. I knew that I needed to take a big step so that I could force myself out of that horrible habit. It makes me ashamed to even think about it. 

But now that I physically can’t do those things I am just so miserable. I know that it’s only been a few days and I have to give this time, but it’s so hard already. I’m on a liquid diet so I can really only eat soups. I like soups, sure, but god do I want a cheeseburger or a slice of pizza. It just feels so pathetic that I haven’t even gone a week yet and I’m already crying because I can’t eat something like that.

I’ve struggled with depression for years and a lot of it stems from my weight and my insecurities around my body (not completely but that’s definitely a huge factor). Now that I can’t eat those things I’m realizing that food was one of the biggest sources of happiness in my life. As sad as that sounds it’s true. Those late night binges were my favorite part of the day even though I felt horrible about myself after I was done. I’m so scared that now that I’ve done this my depression is going to get worse because I have nothing to look forward to anymore. My main source of happiness is gone.

If anyone else has gotten this surgery or just made the change by themselves to cut out unhealthy and fattening foods, I would really appreciate any advice on how to mentally be happy without eating as much. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the comments 💜 I read them all and all of your advice has really helped my mindset. I’m just going to take it one day at a time and know that in the end I’m going to be happy with my decision.",1644731869.0

I’ve recently had these binge episodes, and I have the fear of gaining an unhealthy amount of weight and making these binges a regular habit. 

To summarize it quickly, I used to restrict how much food I ate and I worked out excessively. Ever since December however, I’ve been slowly recovering. However recently at school, I’ve used my money to buy pop tarts and cookies from the vending machine. It’s been a while since I let myself have sweets again and I just couldn’t contain myself. 

It tasted so good and I’ve had like four pop tarts a day. I think I’m beginning to grow an unhealthy addiction to sweets once again. To make matters worse, I’ve also been trying different types of sweets and eating a whole lot of chocolate bars. 

Luckily, my weight is still at a healthy level due to all the restricting I’ve done. But if I continue at this rate, I’m going to be unhealthy once again and be in the same predicament that started my restricting in the first place. 

I feel like I should tell my mother about what I’ve been doing and hopefully get her advice and help. But part of me still is addicted to the sweets and food.

I know it’s in my best interest to tell her so that I don’t continue these unhealthy habits, but at the same time, the sweets are so fucking good.

Easy & Inexpensive Diabetic-Friendly Meals?,3,sqvnqh,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sqvnqh/easy_inexpensive_diabeticfriendly_meals/,4,"Hello all. I'm new to this sub. I am a disabled 36/F who is 5'4 and weighs 325 pounds. Prior to disability, I exercised regularly, walking 5 miles a day in addition to what I walked at my active job as a nursing assistant, and weighed about 125 pounds. Basically, I never altered my eating habits to account for a sedentary lifestyle and developed a habit of binge eating sweets when sad. Which has led to this excessive weight gain and the situation I'm in now, which is recently diagnosed prediabetic. It's time to change before I become an insulin-dependent diabetic.

Due to my disability it is difficult to exercise, though I do walk my dogs for about 10 minutes every day and am looking into joining the local YMCA so I can use the pool once or twice a week. But the majority of my weight loss will be through diet alone.

Part of my problem there is that diabetic-friendly foods are expensive, and cooking is the least expensive route, but due to my disability, cooking is pretty difficult or even impossible some days. I got low sugar low carb meal replacement shakes and bars for breakfast and lunch, and a variety of simple snacks, but I'm running into problems figuring out dinner meals.

So my question is: what are your go-to simplest, inexpensive meals that are low sugar & low carb? Recipes that require little standing in front of the stove, carrying heavy pots, or chopping of produce & meats are preferred here. And no seafood please.

so i don't know what's going on and why i didn't lose weight before. my guess is that maybe i didn't eat enough fiber and protein before, so my metabolism was too slow to process the calories? though i did eat a LOT of fast food for the past year. like almost everyday at work so that probably plays a role in this as well.

also, disclaimer that i have given up fast food and am now paying more attention to what i eat and i do feel a lot better now, but i'm still worried that i might not be able to lose the weight.

Right now for exercise I don't really go to the gym because a) super self conscious, and b) have no clue what to do. So I usually just do a nodded exercise from You Are Your Own Gym, which is 64 sets of lunges, 64 squats, and some arm/leg movement stuff that I have no clue what it's called. I'm also getting into doing sit ups because I find them fun. More focused on getting rid of body fat rather than necessarily turning into a body builder.

Don't really get out much since we get a ton of snow, and its often under 20 degrees F. Any tips or advice would be awesome.",1644687587.0

"Weird question, can I 'trade calories' between two days as long as the total comes out to at or below my limit?",8,sqkkce,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sqkkce/weird_question_can_i_trade_calories_between_two/,16,"Okay, so, I have a very erratic sleeping schedule. I've ALWAYS battled insomnia (and usually lost 🙄), and with Covid, my stress is just like...off-the-wall out-of-the-park.

BECAUSE of this whacky schedule, sometimes I end up eating like...several hundreds of calories under my limit one day. When this is just a matter of like, an hour of midnight, and I'm hungry, I'll put a snack on that previous day (where I had spare calories) and then eat my regular amount the next day. If it's a LOT (sometimes I sleep through a meal), I'll have like...500 or 600 calories spare, which means I still have at least a couple hundred after my snack. For THOSE occasions, I've been afraid to put my next days' meals onto that previous day because it's such a large amount to eat in one day, even though I'm literally just spreading it out and eating in total the proper amount of calories.

I FEEL like my body isn't metabolizing/storing my food based on a kitchen clock, and so as long as the trade off comes off even. And what I mean by that is that I'm never adding more calories than the two days' worth combined, just spreading them out if I have to. If ANYTHING I'm coming in under because of what I said about accidentally missing meals and not wanting to add a whole 300 calories onto my next day even if I ate 300 calories less the day before, and thus it would come out even.

I know it's kind of a jumble, I honestly can't think of a super easy way to put it. I guess if I had to sum it up as concisely as possible, I'd say what I did in the title- is it okay to log extra calories from today onto yesterday's log (which came out several hundred calories below my limit)? Again, I'm never consuming more calories than my diet amount- the total always comes to at or below the two days' calorie limits combined.

Is it okay to do this? I feel like it should be since again, it's not like my body is watching for the stroke of midnight, especially if it's used to an erratic sleep schedule. But I'm really afraid of messing this up, so I thought I'd ask here since I'm sure a lot of you on here have experience with something similar!

I have a sugar addiction to replace drinking and while it's not every day, I will sometimes just eat two candy bars after the other to get the sweet dopamine rush. I was hitting 240lbs before I quit drinking and yesterday I was 292!!! I started couch to 5k running app and am on the end of week 2 and I find it quite challenging but enjoyable. I have gone off and on calorie counting and struggle to stay focused. I'm actually a very good cook (restaurant professional) and can make super healthy meals that are delicious but then I stray after a week. I am doing my cardio 3 days a week and my weight isn't affecting my recovery between gym visits too badly. I was doing a lot of weight training last year (3 months 3 days a week) before the most recent lockdown (Ontario) and had been steadily gaining weight then as well. I still fit my clothes from when I was 40 or so lbs lighter but those are already big to begin with because I had to go up a size  to be more comfortable. I just want to slim down but understanding what is fat, muscle, being physically able to run all kind of jumble into confusion because when I look in the mirror I don't feel like I look overly obese but definitely need to lose at least 90lbs.

Well, I thought so too until I got this list from my doctors:

* Sucralose
* Tea
* Tobacco

* Tomatoes
* Wine sauces

Majority of this is fine as I don’t eat a lot of it anyway, but what I am struggling with is the  Acesulfame pottassium, because my main protein source (shakes) contain it and I am struggling to hit my goal now without it. A lot of the foods I ate contained it. Even my preworkout.

I have back and joint problems that caused me pain even when I was a healthy weight. Now my bmi puts me in the obese category and I can barely do any kind of meaningful exercise to help me lose weight because I'm in pain which means that if I do it on diet alone I'm having to restrict calories too much and just end up binging (I don't believe this to be in a disordered eating way, I just mean that I will eat a lot because I get hungry from restricting).

It's also a vicious cycle because I'm in more pain day to day because of my weight so I need to lose weight to help manage my pain but I'm struggling to lose weight because I'm in pain.

I've made an appointment with my GP to discuss weight management and I don't know what to expect. Has anyone done this and was it useful?

I've put on 35kg in the past 5 years (so far have lost 5kg of that) but before that I used to be an active person so exercise wasn't a problem. So, what I'm hoping is for them to prescribe appetite suppressants so I don't end up binging like I do when I restrict my calories and then once I get to a more healthy weight, exercise should be easier and I can then manage my weightloss myself.

I added a flavouring packet which is 50 cal and just some spices which is barely any calories.

Eating more often to lose weight ?,2,spwd71,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/spwd71/eating_more_often_to_lose_weight/,3,"Hello !  


I am in a curious weight loss situation and would love to here some advice from you.   


I (26 M) am 1,83 m tall and weight around 90 kg. I do lift reguaraly and I also train kickboxing and try to walk a lot to compesate for my desk job, so I would say I am active. My problem is: I am not exactly fat, nobody considers me fat , but I have the body of a profesisonal athlete that stopped training 10 months ago. No matter how much I work out or diet, I still look out of shape, although I can spar with somebody for 15 rounds with short breaks or I can lift weights for hours at the gym. So I tried to reduce my calories. I did not reduce them by a lot, but just enough to start losing weight. 9 months go by and I have actually...gained fat. My ""love handles"" grew bigger and I look even more out of shape. So after reading online and reading a book, I stumbled upon the idea I should eat more often and not maintain a calorie deficit in order to lose weight, because that way I will motivate my metabolism to work faster and burn more fat.  Is that true ? Is that a good idea ?  


And if not, what other posibilities are there for me ? Am I simply cursed by genetics ?

Of course I eat protein, around 100g on most days, so I don't lose muscle.

Around 3 years ago at my heaviest i was 70kg, and i went down by increasing activity etc, but not much of calorie counting, just less chips and stuff.

I'm 16 years old now, 165 cm and 60.7 kgs (i know it seems like a good weight for my height and age but i want to get rid of the fat I have, which is.. still a fair amount.My goal weight would be around 52-55kg.) - and I've been 60.8 - 60.7 since around last year's November, and it's really making me upset. I don't feel good in my body, looking like this. I understand I'm still a teenager but it's still annoying just the same.

But the thing is, I also have been exercising at least 4 times in the last 5 weeks, 30-40 minutes of calisthenics and weightlifting with 10kg dumbbells at home (tried since last 2021's July but wasn't consistent), and I thought maybe the scale isn't moving because I'm gaining muscle at the same time I'm losing fat. But I don't know honestly, I can't tell. I sometimes measure my waist and it's always like 87-89 centimeters which is ..yeah. Never goes down either. According to body fat calculators im obese?
Or maybe artificial sweeteners are the problem? I drink 330ml of Pepsi max on most days, I guess it'd be a good idea to drop that.

What am i doing wrong? I'm sure I count my calories right, sometimes i even add an extra 100 when i look at my daily intake just to be sure. My weekly average is around 10 300 calories.

What with my work schedule being so different from week to week It feels really hard planning out time to exercise and also cook. So I’m trying to condense everything I have to do as much as I can. So basically I was wondering if those of you who are experienced with intermittent fasting could answer me a few things: 

- If I was going to go the Fats and Proteins way, can you suggest any easy/quick to make meals/foods. I don’t mind cooking a little bit, but it would be a great time saver to figure out some easy things I can just slap together with minimal to no cooking and throw in my lunch box and be off to work. Sandwiches sound like their out for this one. Also, is this basically keto? It won’t mess me up if I stay under 50g of carbs, right?

- Is it maybe too extreme to start out fasting every 24 hours? I’m pretty sure I could do it, but could it lessen my weight loss results? Like make my body think it’s starving? 

- also on days you break your fast how many calories are you supposed to eat?

Is it ok to try and find out a plan of daily calories and then use the app to track my exercise so it allows me to eat more or is it best to just type in that I'm moderately active and always eat the same amount of calories regardless of having trained or walked more that day? I enjoy being able to put on the app my daily exercise and steps and how that awards me with eating more.

Painful Martial Arts,1,sppnpu,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sppnpu/painful_martial_arts/,0,"Good evening, I hope someone here can assist me. I have done Karate and Tae Kwon Do from the age of 5 all the way to 17; I enjoyed it and it was a way for me to gain more confidence but once I turned 18 I couldn't really continue it due to financial stress. 
I focused on work and school and I am now 26.
In my prime I was 190lbs of muscle with minor body fat but by 25 I was 250lb and had lost a majority of my muscle due to trying to lose weight by starving myself and then rebounding and gaining more weight.
I can still do a few things such as a split, a spinning roundhouse, round offs, hooks with more difficulty but the muscle memory is there. 
Unfortunately when I do fast kicks that require fast revolutions my arms feel like they're going to fly off, it feels as if all the blood rushes to my hands and it's incredibly painful; I believed it was because of my weight and over the last year I have managed to go down to 210lbs but the spinning kicks still make my arms feel that blood rushing pain and I see stars. 
I hate what I've become and I hope there's a way I can start again. Does anyone know what is causing the pain, I believed it was my arms flailing as well but I tuck them in as much as I can.
I'm at a loss and any advice will be greatly appreciated.",1644551697.0

Unsure what to do??,2,spju0e,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/spju0e/unsure_what_to_do/,8,"I am having a crisis of confidence in the health path I have undertaken

I am 24/25, Male, ~180cm, weighing 81.7-82kg with a muscle mass of 31.6% and body fat % of 24.6-24.9%.

Under the pandemic I got really fat (going from 82kg to 91.5kg and 35% body fat) and having a sugar level on the margin of being classified as pre-diabetic.

I managed to change my diet to one of 1200-1500cal since my previous attempt of 1800cal saw no change in a month. 

I’ve tried just about every medical diet in differing quantities of calories and nutritional values. The one that has worked best has been the current one (1200-1400cal max). I eat at minimum and often 1 meal, and if hungry enough to due to energy expenditure, a 2nd snack/small meal.

I weigh the food. I weight myself weekly in the morning. I have been taking Ozempic at the behest of my endocrinologist, as I was nearly pre-diabetic and, despite being able to feel fine and energized to perform at my desk job and throughout the day, Ozempic helps with an empty stomach holding back calorie use (so drug not used to make me eat less).

I feel like I am not losing fat fast enough. 9-10kg in over a year, despite fluctuations due to trips/vacations, is too little in my perception. During this time I’ve had long periods of time of 60min+ gym sessions with sometimes cardio involved. I would later quit cause, despite months of my intense working out about 5-7 days a week while eating as I had been, there were no changes physically or on the scale in terms of kg, muscle mass or fat %.

The month of January I went from 84-84.5kg to 81.7-82kg. Same diet, no gym. But of course it was after a rather long period of slacking due to festivities/misc. (christmas, a couple of birthdays, year-end vacations, thanksgiving) in which I went from ~82kg to 84-84.5kg.

The last time I saw a proper change was Jan.20. Since then I’ve kinda gone lateral apart from water fluctuations. So I decided that I might as well go back to the gym to accelerate the process and get healthier with more muscle mass (potentially). Since then I’ve gained 1-2kg which I don’t think much about due to long hiatus from stressing muscles yielding water weight and muscle inflammation. 
The issue is that my muscle mass has not at all changed while my body fat % has. And I’ve read some reputable medical web pages claiming this change would take 4 weeks-1 month to normalize. Which is fine.

But I feel like despite all of this, eating 1200-1500 cal is far too little to the point that shouldn’t I be seeing at least a somewhat considerable change in weight/fat? My endocrinologist stated this medical science is not 100% accurate since everyone is different. This is true, but is my body so radically different that must I starve in a desert island in order to reflect the usual consequence of, given my metrics, eating only 1200-1500cal?? Just about everyone, medically certified or not, state what I am doing is virtually ludicrous.

I just wanna be thin, like healthy and maybe semi-visible abs. I don’t at all subscribe to being massively jacked or ripped/toned. Just physically fit and attractive.
and then my friend who was fucking obese and works in construction suddenly got jacked in a year?? complete transformation?? I have asked him, cause despite being dumb I was baffled, if he used steroids and he vehemently denied it. It just absolutely sunk my confidence but I decided to simply trust the process. He has gone on to become even fitter and more jacked and I am still here hoping for a significant change in body fat %, trusting my own process.

I definitely have the mindset to adapt and stick to a routine.

The metrics definitely suggest I am on the right track as far as body fat % / weight loss is concerned, my medical bloodwork is fantastic (no metabolic problems, no carcinogenic mass, all clean).

So what should I do? Seek out a change, whatever that may be, or just continue to trust the process?

btw: I don’t use any drugs or smoke. I may, rarely, partake in alcohol (1-2 drinks).",1644535682.0

I was asked my my mum to go to the local store to grab some milk and a few other things and i left before i could buy anything. It felt like i was being watched from all angles and i started noticing my clothes feel tighter and the people around me may be judging me for my weight.

I've avoided meeting up with friends as im so self conscious about my weight and this experience has caused me to put my foot down and a will to lose this weight as of now. I know its unreasonable to lose 100lbs immediately but i would like to start losing 2lbs a week. 

My exercise has been very lacking as of recently due to the fact i feel i may be judged for going for a long walk/jog. I will post my average daily meals in the comments so this post isnt extremely long.

Listen to what your body needs and sustain that. Don’t follow any of these diets. Just cut the calories. Thats it. Don’t put an expectation of when on it. It comes slowly and its a day by day thing. 
If you eat 2600 calories one day it is ok to cut 500 out of the next day.

I can know that I'm shooting for X calories/day, but when dinner is always a wildcard meal that I eat with family or other people, it makes it really hard to always hit X.

Recently it dawned on me: X calories/day can be averaged over a 24 hour period that *starts* with dinner. This means I then have the entire rest of the ""day"" (e.g. breakfast & lunch the next day) to balance out whatever I ate for dinner the previous night. It will still average out and work just the same.

This may seem obvious to most people, but it was a genuine light bulb moment for me. It made dinners instantly less stressful. I don't have to build in this impossible buffer against unknown wildcards every single day. I just eat dinner, whatever it is, track it, and then eat accordingly the next day so that I hit X before the next day's dinner. Then repeat.

Of course, there are still all the other usual challenges to actually consistently hitting X, but this was still a nontrivial barrier removed.",1644435378.0

Despite this, I feel that my abs are starting to get firm but covered with the same amount of fats.  I don't go to gym as of yet.

1. Is it too early for me to expect a flat tummy?
2. Should I drink whey protein?
3. Should I add different forms of exercise?",1644481291.0

Being obese is exhausting and I'm tired of it,13,sonvoz,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sonvoz/being_obese_is_exhausting_and_im_tired_of_it/,15,"I'm 5'4 and 283 pounds.. I hate my body it and looks terrible at this point

I really cannot stick to a diet and I'm starting to get frustrated. Like I love food we all do; my skinny/friends coworkers eat as much as they want. One of my friends can eat a whole damn cake on her OWN. It just hurts that I gain so much weight when we eat just the same. I mean I eat eggs, bacon, pancake and the like (lil Koolaid here and there) ; you know the standard American diet. I know its not exactly healthy but its typical of everyone around me. Besides that my is job sedentary; I work in data entry so I'm sitting a lot.. I do think I have been dealt a bad deck in the gene category.

Ok so now onto the diets..I usually start off with a ultra healthy diet but I only last a week or two :( I also try to go for short walks after work but that doesn't do much.

Honestly I'm at my wits end and I found this diet pill. Ik the stigma around diet pills but this isn't really a diet pill in my opinion . Its all natural, but I don't know what else to call it. Has anyone tried this? please if you did can you tell me your results? any side effects?

Disclaimer: I know this alone wont help but it's a start. I'm gonna try to go back onto a diet again but that never works because eating it is just so damn miserable. Next time I'm gonna add a cheat day and see if that keeps me on track.

Secondly I know I lack discipline. working out is well painful, to say the least. I know i wont die but its hard to keep going on my own. I'm scared of going to gym, but I think I'm gonna take the leap and get a membership. I have this thing near my house..Its a a bit different than a gym. There are only group workouts. The whole idea is intimidating but I can't stand being fat anymore. I wanna be like other women my age, dating (non existent at the moment) and wearing cute outfits; just the simple things.

Also sorry for any bad grammar or negativity. Im feeling a bit down/rant-y rn. Please do not come here and discourage me from the pill. I'm signing up for the gym tomorrow and will see if that have any nutrition programs as well. So I wont just be on this pill thinking it's a save all. Although I appreciate the little help it may bring

Someone on my WL group posted this; can someone look at this website tell me what they think? I googled and the reviews all seem good.

Lastly this isn't really something thats gonna make me loose appetite or anything like that. The blend of plant hurts aids in fat burning. So if I'm working out it's gonna maximize my workout. I just wanna know if anyone else has taken this b4 i buy cause its a bit expensive. Although I can't say its not worth the cost.

&#x200B;

Thank you guys for all the beautiful advice. Im gonna take the time later tonight and reply to all of them/ make plans to implement your advice.

She also has nerve damage in her legs preventing her from walking safely (she can do a few steps but not much). 

She's tried every diet you can think of. She's done restricted calories, low carb, etc. She just gains the weight back or doesn't drop at all. 

She's very difficult to motivate because she's just giving up. She doesn't want to try anymore and she says food is one of the only things now that she can enjoy since she can't do much of anything else, which makes me feel really bad. I really want her around as long as possible because she has a husband, children, and grandchildren who love her dearly. My dad mostly cooks for her and he is a really picky eater so he won't make her too many healthy options. She also buys indulgent options, which doesn't help. She definitely has an unhealthy relationship with food. I think it's also out of convenience and financial reasons that they eat the way they do. 

Would love any tips on how I can help motivate her and maybe some practical tips on.. perhaps.. intuitive eating? She laughs at the thought of seeing a dietician because when she has done that before, she would crack jokes and be super sarcastic not taking it seriously. Anything really that we may be overlooking as an option for her that doesn't require surgery or exercise involving her legs.

Need Advice With Weight Loss/Motivation,5,sopb0q,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sopb0q/need_advice_with_weight_lossmotivation/,2,"Hi everyone(:

So I am a 21-year-old female about 5'2 and weighs 205. I gained a lot of weight over the last 2-3 years due to eating disorders caused by multiple factors. I've always been a bit overweight for my age and height and had a stomach so I've always tried to work out, but this is the worst it's been. My mom is very strict for my age and has made a rule that I can't do ""x, y, and z"" until I meet my health goal of 155. I start spring break next month and want to go out of town but I KNOW she will not budge unless I am near or at this goal. I have a gym membership and I know how to eat healthily but still keep room for balance. Here's what I'm struggling with:

1. I have terrible social anxiety so going to the gym can be an issue or I feel as if I don't have enough time due to being a full-time college student. 
2. Motivation is very hard for me to be consistent with. I was motivated over the summer and lose 20 pounds but I haven't been motivated since. 
3. I have a terrible restrict/binge eating disorder. I take meds for my ADHD and they suppress my appetite until night time and I tend to binge since I am hungry from not eating or not eating enough. 
4. I tend to get lazy when it comes to cooking so I will doordash and that is an absolutely horrible thing for my ED because ill eat a lot from doordashing. I have deleted and redownloaded the app multiple times. 

There's so many more factors but I feel these are the ones I struggle with the most. I am good at limiting salt and sugar intake, things like that.  Overall, I'd like to know how to manage these things and if anyone has advice on how to set my day(s) up to find time to workout and any good workouts for someone who does have anxiety but would like to lose a good amount of weight in the next month, by summer, and to keep it off. I'm sorry if I am ranting, I just need to do something about this and I cant seem to find my own motivation even though this is something I want to do.",1644444271.0

Now before you say ""Oh thats nothing, thats average"" etc etc, let me elaborate.

I am a 15 year old boy, supposed to be in highschool but I started late, and everyone around me is making efforts to gain muscle and feel more confident. Every day, I do nothing but go to school, come home and lounge around. Whether its playing games, texting or something else, I barely ever actually excersize. 

I do stuff like walk my dog, clean up and stuff, but none of these things will help me lose weight because I eat way more. I find myself eating chips everyday, drinking sugars (mountain dew, mello yello etc) every day and just random snacking too. Literally I will get up, grab a bag of chips, then 15 minutes to an hour later, grab a granola bar or something. Point is, I eat too much. 

I also hear from almost anybody i eat around that I eat fast, like very fast. Like i will have finished the plate before they have eaten a quarter of theirs. I want to make a change, but Idk where to start.

We ran around the block and I was the last one because I absolutely HATE running.

I love playing the games and sports because it doesn't feel like torture, and the workout videos I don't mind much because I used to do them at home, but I'm always sore and the teacher expects us to keep going. I'm the only unathletic one in my class, and I'm the most overweight (although I don't think I look it because of the way my fat is distributed, I'm a bit wider than them but I don't look ""round"")

My problem is we keep doing these high impact things like running and the workout videos like P90X and I always get sore, I can't even sit. There's no rest days unless I'm absent, and I'm pretty sure if you're so sore you shouldn't be doing more high impact exercises because your muscles are basically injured and you're just asking for more pain.

As someone who has trouble with binging, loves fat food, and desserts, this road goes 1 of 2 ways:

1. I **restrict to ""healthy food""** all week but in the weekend I binge.
2. I try to **moderate all kinds of foods** all week instead of restricting, but the portions are either too small so my craving stays, or I eat -enough-, but then there is no caloric deficit.

Neither one of the 2 actually makes me lose weight and I am sick of the constant cravings.

I have been getting just meat and vegetables with some potatoes here and there. The only snacks i eat are fruit which I eat sparingly. I eat fruit or a small chicken and kale salad for breakfast and I never overeat for any meal.

I've started to realize that my heart palpitations are back (my heart is fine, I've had it checked) and I'm pretty tired when I wake up in the morning, and it's making me want to transition back to just matcha. I'm worried that if I do this my gains are going to slow and I won't be able to work out as hard or have as much motivation to. 

What do people think? Have you had any sort of similar experience? Do you drink caffeine before exercising?",1644414653.0

I’ve been eating an 1800 calorie diet, down from my usual 4-5000 one (thanks, eating disorder). I use a calorie counter app which tells me how many carbs, grams of fat, and protein to eat. I stay under the amount as much as possible. I exercise nightly. Nothing too heavy. Squats, lunges, wall pushups. 

Today, when I weighed in, I had gained a pound. Now, I know that doesn’t seem like a lot, but for someone who has always struggled with weight and is in recovery from an eating disorder, this threw me. I immediately felt the urge to relapse. It was bad. And it still is.

I would like to lose a few lbs, ideally 10-15lbs, and have been eating about 1200-1500 calories per day for the last two months (1200 baseline and more based on how active I am). 

I don’t have a regular workout routine, but I would say I have on average 2-3 days a week where I’ll either go on a hike, bike ride, or to a workout class. And tbh I have a 9 month old and work full time, so it is just not realistic for me to up my working out enough to make a significant difference to my weight loss. I don’t follow a super strict diet, but try to stay away from grains and processed foods and focus on lean protein, fruits and vegetables.

So, like, I think I’m doing okay. I’m at the top end of the healthy BMI range, but technically not overweight. It’s just that my weight loss is sooooo slow. I use MyFitnessPal to track calories, and just follow their recommendations (I have it set to the maximum loss but it will never recommend below 1200). And honestly it’s such slow going that I almost want to say f it, give up on losing weight, and go back to eating whatever I want, since it feels like I’m doing all this tracking for nothing. 

I want to be healthy, but it’s tempting to cut back to more like 800-1000 calories as my baseline. I’ve successfully lost weight at that amount before and never had the “starvation mode” or nutrition issues people talk about (but I also had a lot more to lose back then). 

So like - is that okay? A 6ft tall guy would be dropping lbs super quickly doing what I’m doing, so it doesn’t seem to make sense to me that he would be able to eat so far below his tdee and it’s healthy, but I can’t even cut down enough to lose 1lb a week without it being dangerous? How can people of different sizes have the same caloric minimum when their maintenance amount is so different? Also - why is it okay to eat 1200 calories on a day and work off 500 extra, but not okay to just eat 500 fewer in the first place?",1644367603.0

For the longest time I’ve tried to lose weight but never ever stayed consistent at all. The longest id go is a week or 2 at max and slip up by temptations and have to start all over again. 

The only time I’ve successfully lost weight was in 2021 after doing Keto for a month then switching to a balanced diet and an active lifestyle. 

I’m now more sedentary WFH, and had a crazy binge season for 3 months which is how I gained 20lbs at the end of 2021. 

I started a fitness program last week which is a circuit training Boot Camp style studio, I plan to do 2 cardio sessions, 1 strength training session and 1 hybrid session a week. I’m also using a meal prep service from next week that does my calories for me.

How many calories should I be eating?,1,snxhzd,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/snxhzd/how_many_calories_should_i_be_eating/,7,"
I’m so confused by TDEE. 

So I am female, 26, around 5ft6 and currently weight 211lbs. 

I do 30 minutes of exercise (mostly strength) 4-5 times a week and try to be active on ‘rest days’ as well by doing low impact stuff (yoga/recovery). 

My calorie tracking app says in order for me to be in a “lightly active” lifestyle and up my deficit to 1800 calories, I have to walk around 7.5k steps a day (which I don’t necessarily do, I try do around 5k - I have a kid attached to my hip most days and find it hard) or burn 2,045 calories - which seems like impossible? 

I’m currently in a deficit of 1500, and I’m finding it really difficult and feeling super tired so guessing I need to increase? But I’m terrified of gaining anymore weight, I’ve struggled for so long and i just find it all very confusing! 

Thank you :)",1644361117.0

(Funny rant. You can check my post history where I’ve shared history of coworkers pressuring me to eat unhealthily)

What is up with coworkers randomly bringing junk food to work and acting oh so shocked when you politely decline? Lol 

I sometimes bring lunch to work and it’s usually something healthy. I don’t snack at my desk so it’s not like everyone can easily guess my favorite foods. When they offer donuts, candy, etc and other decline, it’s okay but when I decline they always comment that I must be eating healthy. It’s as if they expect me, one of the heaviest in my department but not the heaviest in the office, to always want to eat and not give a F about calories/health. The other plus size women always accept the food offered.

Another coworker always declines and says she can’t because she’s watching her weight and everyone respects that without pressuring her but I’m asked if I’m sure and that the donuts are fresh, etc.
Also I socialize with everyone so it’s not as if bringing food is their way of chatting with me.

First and foremost I’m in a 500 calorie deficit from my maintenance, second, I burn 500+ calories everyday from walking 7.5-10 miles everyday which causes me to burn around 1000 calories. But here is the thing. I am TIRED OF DOING THIS. Even though I listen to music or call up a friend or listen to a podcast, walking has become so mundane and so mind numbing and it honestly bores me so much. It takes me around 2-3 hours to walk all that and after about 45 minutes of walking, it gets so boring. Just walking and walking and watching the blocks pass by and so on. I don’t really get physically tired from all the walking but mentally, it’s so damn draining because I get so bored and I HATE DOING IT. i have been using that as my primary source tj lose weight and even though it’s boring, it’s very quick.

Even before dieting officially, I never see myself as overeating; I would eat 1 maybe 2 meals a day and they were always with fruits and veggies, with maybe 2 small snacks at work. 

I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong 😅


ETA: here’s what a typical day looks like: 

- breakfast: chocolate premier protein shake, bubly bounce water or coffee with 2tbsp of creamer 

- lunch: fruit and veggies or maybe meat/cheese rolled up, strawberry spindrift drink, very rarely leftovers or the dinners below

- dinner: meal prepped dinner from a local company which has 1 serving of meat, a half cup of a vegetable and a half cup of fruit 

- snack: skinny pop popcorn or veggie straws. Lots of water. Occasionally a WW mini chocolate popsicle

ETA2:

So I’m getting close to my weight loss goal and I feel I have a super important tip for everyone. As I know that a lot of diets and lifestyles changes isn’t the same for everyone I do feel this tip can be. My 1# tip for people who are trying to lose weight is if you eat something unhealthy, remind yourself it’s okay!!

Might sound a bit weird I know, but I can’t tell you how many times in my past I would diet only to be consumed by cravings. Once I caved to the cravings I would either feel guilty and punish myself by being stricter (which only led to failure) or feel ashamed that I can’t overcome simple cravings and all together just give up.

If this is you, and you cave in to that guilty food you crave, remind yourself that it’s okay. Let yourself know that your not going to gain all the weight back just because of that one meal. Think about tomorrow and maybe the healthy meal you will eat to get back on track. 

We are human, we make mistakes. Always remind yourself of the beast you are, envision your goals. I believe in you :)",1644177934.0

She mentioned that every single meal should include the four staples: veggies, healthy fats, lean proteins and healthy carbs.

She said that a lot of that fiber can come from whole grains/whole wheat foods, but I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions on how I can increase my daily fiber intake without binging on too many carbs? Any creative recipes that includes quinoa or black beans?",1644250239.0

I focus largely on weight training, where I’m sure each workout I’m burning a few hundred calories. Are these calories accounted for in my initial daily goal (say 2500 or whatever, the large number) or should I be adding a couple hundred like it does for steps? 

My initial thought when realizing I should be adding extra was that it made sense; I’ve been feeling especially exhausted lately when adhering to my calorie goals, but I also haven’t been moving the scale down much, so maybe my initial assumption was right?

I'm 5 feet tall, and my weight before going to college three years ago was 165 pounds (75 kg). 

Due to a combination of a bad diet and having to run to classes all day, I lost 37 pounds in 2-3 months and my weight went to 128 pounds (58 kg). When I say my diet was bad, I mean it was really bad. Most days I survived on a cup of tea and a packet of chips, mostly because the cafeteria food was disgusting and I didn't have time. Once I noticed I was losing weight, I started going to the gym. It was inconsistent and only for around 30 minutes. 

Then lockdown happened and I was back home. I have tried and failed multiple times to work out in the last 2 years. Obviously, I didn't lose any but my weight stayed consistent. In the last month or so, I gained around 10 pounds. 

I've been consistently working out for over 2 weeks now and my weight just keeps increasing. 

I'm making sure I have a calorie deficit. The app I use says my caloric intake should be less than 1200, and I am maintaining it. I am working out every day and have started using weights and resistance bands. For the last week, I have been running 1.5 miles every single day. I'm trying to eat healthier, incorporating more fruits and green vegetables into my diet. It's difficult since I'm at home and my mom is in charge of the food but I am trying my best. Also, for the last few days, I have been feeling hungrier.

My 90+ pound weight loss,29,smgdkn,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/smgdkn/my_90_pound_weight_loss/,8,"Hi all,
Today I’m gonna share the story if my 90+ pound weight loss. I’m currently 16 years old and a junior in high school. I had been overweight ever since I was about 7-8. I wouldn’t say I was bullied but I was definitely pushed around a bit. Through middle school and up to the beginning of high school my weight only increased, my mental health decreased with that to and some other factors, but that’s for a different time. At this time I was also only 5 foot 2. So I was short and very very obese, probably around 230-240 pounds. My confidence translated to that. It was shit. My mom had this personal training friend who we’ll call Jack. I had worked with Jack in the past, would lose a few pounds but then just stop and gain it back within a couple weeks. I had approached my mom and said I wanted to train with him again. She wanted to see me do it on my own first, she said I would have to go the gym 4 times a week on my own to show consistency before she would allow me to train with Jack again. Sure enough that’s what I did. When the time came to finally go back to train with him, he put me on the scale. I was shocked see that I was over 200 pounds never the less 225-230. Something about seeing that 2 in front of my weight got to me. After that session I went home and had a good solid cry. Then I did what most people do when they first try to lose weight cut out carbs. DO NOT DO THIS!!! When I first cut out carbs I lost about 20 pounds but I would always feel tired and fatigued. I would have shitty workouts etc. After this I started doing my own research. I discovered YouTube channels like Greg Doucette and Will Tennyson. These YouTubers introduced me to calorie counting and intuitive recipes that made dieting so much easier. After watching these guys, I cut my calories super low. Down to like 12-1300. Also DO NOT DO THIS!!!  I managed to lose a good 30 pounds but I felt even worse then before and had zero strength. After much trial and error/ countless setbacks I finally found the right training program that worked for me as well as the right calorie intake. Through relentless mental fortitude and grit I managed to lose 90 pounds and increase my strength significantly. This has been the single greatest journey of my life and it will never stop so long as I live",1644205648.0

More people need to do maintenance phases.,15,sm5mfe,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/sm5mfe/more_people_need_to_do_maintenance_phases/,0,"I think a lot of people overlook the need for a maintenance phase in their weight loss journey. I’ve lost 40 lbs over the course of 40 weeks and just starting this year, I’ve been trying to figure out why I feel so fatigued all the time. I was irritable, tired, my lifts weren’t going up, and my anxiety was flaring up. I was having trouble sleeping as well. 

I tried taking a 2 week deload from the gym and that did very little. For the last week, I’ve upped my calories to maintenance and I’m feeling completely back to normal. Everyone needs to get their metabolism back to baseline now and then. As you lose weight, your metabolism gradually slows and you also gradually begin to accumulate diet fatigue. I’m planning on taking a minimum of 2 weeks eating at maintenance, but most doctors and trainers recommend going at least 60% as long as you spent dieting. In the future, I’m going to do 12 weeks losing and 8 weeks maintaining depending on how this 2 week phase goes. 

In the end, it will take you longer to lose weight; however, taking maintenance phases are more sustainable and will help make sure you lose mostly fat instead of shredding lbs of muscle along with that fat.",1644176842.0
When to start weight training?,3,smgw4r,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/smgw4r/when_to_start_weight_training/,4,"Hi all, I am a month into my weight loss journey & am about 1.5 lbs away from hitting my 10 lb officially lost mark.

My fitness goals are to lose 100 pounds, look more defined, and gain a slimmer physique. For context, I have lost 70 pounds now in 7 months and have been consistently attending 1 hour HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) class 2-3 times a week, and walking-jogging at the gym the days I don't. I have also adopted a healthier diet, mostly consisting of protein shakes, fish, vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins. I take a rest day on Sunday and work out 5-6 days a week. In my HIIT classes, I use TRX suspension trainers, sandbags, and kettlebells among other gym equipment. The sandbags and kettlebells are the only pieces of equipment that involve weight and are also my only experience of weight usage. I am also trying to remain in a caloric deficit to help me lose weight. I've also recently been measured for my fat percentage and it's about 30%, which I hope to lower to 25%. My dilemma is if I start lifting, will I start putting on weight? I'm currently 210 pounds, and I have this bet with my dad to race first to 199, so weight loss is one of my priorities. On top of this, 180 is my ideal weight loss end goal. I was thinking perhaps I should start lifting once I hit 180 to also reduce body fat.

I am 29 years old female, living in UK. I've always been a lil chubby and I've tried losing weight maybe a hundred times. Intermittent fasting, calorie deficit, hypnosis, reading psychology books, quitting sugar and other snacks, diets, different sports, just eating healthier in general... Some I probably cannot even remember. 
I have ADHD and depression which does not help me with motivation. I've been to doctors asking them to help me as I am destroying myself physically and mentally for years, but as I'm not a ""lost cause"" for them I am not worth attention.
I cannot stop eating. If I eat I eat for two people. If I'm bored I eat. I started hiding snacks from myself as I sometimes forget that I have them, so I wouldn't eat it in two days. Even if I'm busy I find time to grab a snack. My brain is just occupied with food and thoughts about it. 
Motivation such as ""you can do it, I believe in you, good job on not eating that candy bar, everyone can loose weight"" just does not work for me.
I have never lost weight and every year I just gain more and more. My husband always makes comments about my eating habits and it just destroying me slowly. I don't even want to imagine what is going to happen to me when I'll be pregnant... I will not be able to stop myself and I know that. 
I have tried so many things and none of them worked. I loose motivation after 2-3 weeks. The longest time I've done something was almost 9 months of not eating chips and sweets. I barely lost any weight... Since then I gained it back and more. 
Do you have any suggestions how to loose weight? Please, I cry almost every night as I cannot force myself to look at food differently. I want to think about something else than food, I want to trust myself. 
I know that I need to be in calorie deficit to loose weight, but I just cannot do it. 
Any suggestions welcome. Thanks",1644188474.0

I've struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember, going into high school, which starts at grade 7 in Montreal. I was 220lbs as a 12 year old. During the summer, my parents sent me to a hockey training camp mainly to get some form of exercise that wasn't thumb or wrist ones. I Puked my guts out on the first three days but by the end of the month there I had lost 30 pounds and it really changed my high school experience the next year.

I eventually ballooned up back to 260 by the time I finished grade 9 ( I was a gamer, smoker and eater and my genes certainly did not favor that). This time though, I was depressed and had a drug addiction to deal with. So instead of doing the healthy thing and starting to work out and eat healthy again.. I more or less starved myself by consuming nothing but a Nutella bagels, coffee, and nicotine. I was maybe taking in 600 calories a day. So over the course of that summer, I lost almost 70 pounds in 3 months.

Over the last 5 years since I was 180 pounds and unhealthy, I've reached heights of 345 pounds.

The reason I felt all this information was important, is because there are a lot of different big guys, some that have been big there whole life, some that we're previously fit, and some like me that kind of sit in the middle. (I think it's good to give context for better advice)

Now onto the last 3 months, I've been watching Derek quite a bit, and there's something about the way he presents information that really resonates with me. I decide to take a serious attempt at this fitness thing.

I started at 315, counting my calories (weighing and measuring). Working out 4 times a week. I'm currently doing 2 sessions of HIIT, 1 sessions of upper body, and 1 session of legs a week. and eating at about a 600-800 calorie deficit. All was going well and I lost 15 pounds in Nov-DEC my lifts were going up consistently and still have, However over the last month and a bit. I've completely plateaued weight wise. I can't get under the 290 mark and consistently find myself back up to 300+. Another problem I'm experiencing is a massive lack of energy. Not only being at a caloric deficit but cutting out 90% of the carbs a processed sugar I was consuming has really beat me up. Hoping some of you guys have experienced something similar to varying degrees. I truly appreciate if you read through this to help me. Thanks

"With Covid's disproportionate impact on those who are obese, I'm worried about my sister, and I don't know what to do.",0,smcaia,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/smcaia/with_covids_disproportionate_impact_on_those_who/,2,"I know this may seem weird to talk about here, but it IS technically weight loss advice. Than and the Covid help Reddit won't even let you POST until you're a 'trusted member'. So, you know, if you're having a Covid-related mental crisis but don't fit their standards, then, you know. Tough luck.

BUT. That's beside the point.

I'm worried about my sister, who is a university student (and also commutes, so is coming back and forth to our house from school every time she goes. My mom is 55, so I'd rather not have that coming home constantly, but she teaches at an elementary school, so that point is probably moot either way). She isn't like...OMG heavy (the fat acceptance movement would probably consider her on the smaller/mid size), but it IS significant. She's always been heavier than me once we were both full grown (she's younger than me, but also a couple inches taller, so 🤷‍♀️). Even at my heaviest (the weight that shocked me into changing- 242), she was at least a few pounds heavier than me. I'm about 216 now (two and a half months on), but my sister hasn't been doing the same. I'm basically surrounded by all the same stuff I was before dieting- at least most of the REAL junk was mine >.<

My hesitancy to mention this comes in multiple forms. One, I don't want to be the person who loses/starts losing weight and then badgers everyone else about it. Those people are insufferable. Two, my sister gets VERY defensive, and I'm positive this would escalate into a one-sided fight- not that I think it isn't WORTH IT, but still. Three, my sister is freaked out about Covid too, and she's smart, so I FEEL like she probably knows the risk factors- the problem is that I'm not sure she knows how BIG a role obesity plays in Covid hospitalizations.

I should point out that, aside from her weight, my sister is very healthy. Our family (at our house) has been blessed with health, in that none of us have anything ELSE that would put us at risk for Covid. My mom has a high-risk JOB, but she's extremely careful, and I feel like , while risk does go up with age, she isn't old enough for it to be a HUGE concern (though of course it doesn't stop me, as her daughter and a person with extreme anxiety). Our family has eye issues, and my sister is lactose intolerant, and that's about it.

So, my question is, should I mention it? I really don't want to, but I also really don't want to jeopardize her health if she DOESN'T understand the risk just because I don't want a fight. And I am POSITIVE it would turn into a fight. So I guess my question is, adding in all those factors, is it worth it to bring it up? I mean, on one hand, it's about my loved ones' health, so I want to say yes, but on the other, she may already know. And if so, what is the best way to do it? One idea I've had is to talk to my mom with my sister in the room- my mom isn't thin, but she isn't obese, probably average for a woman in America- and just bring up the statistics to her in conversation as, like, they apply to me. Like, talk about how that helped motivate me to change. Then if my sister is willing to do anything about it, she'd be fully informed and would do it. And if not, me talking to her won't make any difference anyway. That's all I can think of, though.

Hope you're doing well. Has anyone had any success with a straightforward meal plan that someone who struggles with self-care could follow? 

Exercise is becoming a regular part of my life which is grand (and mostly down to my awesome little dog) but my diet is absolute trash currently. Some days I do really well, but others I will just eat anything we have in the house. 

I've had success losing weight with calorie counting in the past, but I became very obsessed to a point where it was unhealthy. I'm a little worried with doing that again. 

I was wondering if there's a meal plan I could buy to get me started? Or a set plan with recipes that I could stick to knowing that's my set of calories for the day? I'm in the UK if that helps with what's available. I don't have any dietary restrictions/not allergic to anything.

I am trying to get a more toned body. I am pretty skinny and a long distance runner. Apart from general running muscle (which isn't a lot - some decent calf muscle, quads and some abs) I'm really scrawny and have no idea how to proceed. I really want nicely toned legs. I have a lot of fat on my upper thigh (I guess just my body type) and not much fat anywhere else. I would love help losing the thigh fat and learning how to look more toned. Here's my routine breakdown:

- I just got a puppy so it's slower, I will give the normal breakdown:

Run up to 40km a week (usually 5km  8km, 5km and a long run on the weekend).

Some general strength exercise - arms weights, squats, wall sit - but that's about it

Lots of walking, and swim sometimes after a long run to cool off. Also lots of running around with my dog during the day.

I also eat a lot, lots of carbs and lots of veggies.  probably not a lot of protein as I don't like meat that much and steer away from most.

We've been doing general strength training stuff (arm day, shoulder day, leg day, 6 days then 1 rest day) which works for him since he's trying to build muscle.

I went one month and checked my weight, and I gained 8 lbs. I'm thinking that's probably in muscle, as that's all that would make sense. I haven't been using the fact I work out to eat poorly, if anything I've been much more mindful about my portion sizes and such. (I'm not looking to change my diet much at the moment as I'm still a dependent and working on a specific diet would be difficult) My main questions are these - How can I discern if I'm gaining fat or muscle? Is strength training effective for fat loss in the first place? BTW I'm planning to start taking monthly pictures to see if I can see any changes visibly.

Hi I’m 15 and started my journey when I was 14 I was 180 now I’m down to 144, how I did it? Simple, portion control. Have a healthy balanced breakfast maybe like some scrambled eggs a toast and some orange juice, than for lunch 2 ham and cheese rolls and for dinner white meat (red meat is fine I guess if you can’t control the meat your family gets just be in mind how much you eat) and some vegetables. I cut out a lot of processed foods (chips, soda, fast food, etc.) and high empty calorie foods (foods that are high in calorie but don’t make full) and took out juice. You can have days where you just eat what you want but make sure you’ve already lost 10 pounds at least and when you have those cheat days don’t beat yourself up it’s only water weight you can’t gain weight in one day it has happened to me before and if you are gonna start loosing weight just to look good please don’t how thin you are doesn’t make for how beautiful you are but how healthy you are. Please be in a mindset in which you want to lose weight for your health. I also worked out the whole time I used apps like “lose weight in 30 days for men” that’s what worked for me. Also don’t super restrict your calories you are gonna mess up your metabolism. The max you should go is a 500 calorie deficit, and just remember you didn’t get overweight/obese in one day and you won’t lose weight in one day either it takes time and dedication. Good luck! If you have any questions please feel free to ask them. If you start to experience any eating  disorder symptoms please stop and go back into regular calories (2000 is usually maintenance for most people) and see if you can try to get help for your diet.",1644076499.0
