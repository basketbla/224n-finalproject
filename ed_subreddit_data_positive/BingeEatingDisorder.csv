After a binge episode, whether it be days long or just one session, someone will put out or buy easily bingeable food.

Today, I told myself this is enough and I’m going to resist binging (as I’ve just come out of a 3 day long binge). But when I got home from work I see freshly baked cookies.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Out of any of the days for cookies to be put out, it has to be the first day I decided to start recovering again. (Of course, the baker is not at fault. BED is my personal issue, but it definitely doesn’t help!)

I need tips on how to NOT give in to the urge to binge. It’s especially hard to resist it the first day of trying to recover so please any advice would help.",1645392801.0

Can't stop binging when at my parents' house,26,swfxp2,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/swfxp2/cant_stop_binging_when_at_my_parents_house/,9,"Shameless repost from another subreddit but I need help.

Everytime I go to my parents, my entire brains just flips a switch that makes me eat everything in sight no matter what it is. I'm genuinely trying everything, I tried to be less restrictive about what goes in my house so there's less of that sense of ""you're never gonna see all this shit again better gorge"", I'm distracting myself loads and as much as I can, and I just cannot seem to stop. Everytime I put anything in my mouth, a domino effect just unravels.

I can think of a few reasons, such as that I don't have any sort of space of my own at my parent's house, therefore I can't really go and work on anything. Secondly I don't have access of any of my ""safe"" foods. I wanted to go out and get myself sorted  but this Storm Eunice is really fucking my shit up. I swear to god I can be in the best mood ever but if the weather begs to differ, I'm just instantly suicidal.

I'm not even saying this in a weight way, I'm bloated and groggy and my entire body hurts at touch because of the water retention. I just want to be able to feel better while I'm here which is extremely difficult because it feels like existing is a sensory overload.

It's like everytime I step into the kitchen, even if I'm just getting some water, it happens all over again. It just feels impossible to resist anything and it's like I'm possessed. I hate it all.",1645293766.0

I’ve taken the first steps to addressing my BED; but what do I do next?,2,swgb93,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/swgb93/ive_taken_the_first_steps_to_addressing_my_bed/,0,"Since discovering recently that I have BED, I’ve been looking into what to do to solve it. Here’s what I’ve done so far:

- Begin listening to the Dear Body podcast and following Jessi’s Tik Tok account

- Deleted MyFitnessPal

- Decided to not worry about “cutting” for bodybuilding purposes for the foreseeable future 

- Researching and practicing intuitive eating

- Switching from a mindset of mental restrictions to a positive reinforcement approach (for example: instead of looking at how many days I fail, I’m counting how many days I successfully avoid bingeing)

- Researching potential professional help via therapy 

But these first steps are good for motivation, but I’ve been motivated before. I’ve researched and tried dozens of approaches to “fixing my health,” and some have worked in the short term. What I’m concerned about is how do I address the underlying issues that cause my BED?

For example, today with my kids at the zoo, I allowed myself to eat Cheezits during their snack time. Usually I would restrict myself from eating it because it’s a “bad” food. But I ran 4 miles this morning and was hungry. Eating carbs is okay. Eating a serving of Cheezits is okay. But I know from experience that eating Cheezits (or other snacky food) can lead to a binge.

How do I know anything’s different? I’m eating intuitively and trying to not count calories or practice negative restrictions. But how do I know I’m not just setting myself up for another binge?",1645294763.0

Im a 25 year old who for the last 5 years has been sneaking cash (I have a unique living situation and all money in my family is shared) and buying takeaway meals to eat in secret. Then going home acting like I’m all good and am soo hungry for dinner/lunch and eating another meal. Last year I gained 8kgs doing this. I have so much guilt around it because I want to lose weight and become healthier but I have this addiction. My diet at home is healthy. If i know im going out by myself I plan to make excuses why im running late to come home just so I can binge. I’ll scoff a large meal in under 2 minutes just because im rushing myself. How do i stop this????? I can’t let my family find out.  I fixate on the meal and my thoughts get clouded because all I can think about is eating. Has anyone experienced this before? It got worse when i got my drivers license because I could drive anywhere on my own.  I probably do this once a week/ two weeks. 😭,1645266194.0

Having an eating disorder, especially BED, is one of the most isolating human experiences. I've tried searching in the past to see if anyone could relate or was talking about BED, and always got discouraged because it is hardly talked about. I don't know why I never tried Reddit!

Reading about other's experiences, I actually can't even believe others like me exist. It is actually a major mind-trip. 

Currently coming off of a horrid binge last night. Housemates went to bed early, the kitchen was mine for the taking. Struggling to tame the intestines and brain-fog in order to have a half functional day at work. I can't afford to take anymore time off. I can't keep doing this. 

I have struggled with restrictive eating, compulsive exercise and binge-eating for more than half my lifetime. I've tried seeking professional help a few times, but it is never the right fit. It always feels abrasive, is always focuses on my past restricting attempts, never taking my bingeing seriously in the slightest (partly due to the fact that people see me as a relatively fit person...)

Sometimes, I'm on top of the world, I'm fit and in control and care-free. But it is a fine line. This past month, I've probably spent more than $500 on food that I've binged in secret, half of which ends up being thrown out in extravagant and shameful ways. This is a hard thing to reflect on, as a struggling grad student. Sometimes I attempt to purge, but I've never been successful. I just sit in my bulging body of shame, and wait for it to process what I've dealt it in order for me to attempt to function what others perceive as properly again.  

Sometimes my binges are spontaneous, but lately, they've been planned. Who the hell plans to do this to themselves?! I'm losing so much time. So much money. So much life. 

This is the first time I've ever spoken (written?) in any amount of detail about what I am living through. But reading through other's posts, I felt as though maybe I could finally start sharing. And start communicating with others. The internet isn't all bad, after all.

New here!

I have been working out for 5 years now. All that time I have counted every calories with no problem. Lately I have been trying to cut some fat so I can look aesthetic by summer, but I have started to experience binge eating episodes. I can stuff my face 10k calories easily, like I actually did last week. And now I binged again, all with healthy food, weirdly enough. I went 2000kcal over my maintenance today. I am planning to fast tomorrow so I can counteract it, even though I know its the opposite of what I should be doing. Self hatred will get me through tomorrow, but I cant but wonder when its the next time my brain snaps and I'll eat everything I have in this house.

This has never happened to me. Its like my brain has snapped and I cant control myself when binge episode starts. It can start all of a sudden. I weigh about 75kg, I am 186cm tall male. I am at healthy weight but its been my forever dream to get to about 10% bodyfat at least once, but in two months I havent made any progress due to binge eating episodes which seem to happen once in every one to two weeks.

Its like I dont have any control anymore when it comes to self disclipine. I feel so weak and defeated mentally, its awful.  I dont even eat that little that these crazy cravings could be justified, I eat around 2000kcal on a typical day. And I know lot about nutrition through my long time fitness hobby. I eat mainly healthy stuff: veggies, eggs, meats, oats for carbs etc so its not like junk food triggers me.

I’ve struggled with eating disorders since high school and was very restrictive. I had lost 60 pounds within 3 months from barely eating and over exercising. At first the weight loss was unintentional due to an undiagnosed anxiety disorder, but then it became an obsession.  I started taking diet pills and working out for two hours almost every day and limiting my calorie intake to 800-1000 calories a day. This behavior lasted until college.

In college, my boyfriend at the time whom I was with since high school confessed that he had cheated on me for two years. After I found that out, something inside me snapped. Like I should stop “taking care of myself” and stop caring about my appearance if I was going to be cheated on anyway. From there I ate whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. When I started gaining weight rapidly, I attributed it to the bingeing, but it turned out to be hypothyroidism. So now after 5 years, I’ve gained a significant amount of weight, my health isn’t the greatest, and yet I still continue to binge. I am ashamed of who I am and what I look like and am trying to lose weight. Anytime I try and make a meal plan, I overeat. I refuse to step on a scale because I know it will be harmful. I wanted to share my story so that maybe I can just heal and try to cope with all the bullshit that’s led me here. I want a better relationship with food. I just want help.

Binge eater from London town here,4,svi4sk,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/svi4sk/binge_eater_from_london_town_here/,1,"Hi everyone.

First of all, it's relieving to see there are many other people who know what it feels like to be a binge eater. 

I sit here on a stormy day in London, having already consumed a rather large Spanish omelette, a packet of tortellini and pasta, a large share back of starburst and a Huel shake (funny to have a meal replacement as well as 3 other meals).

I'd actually thought I was going to be playing football at 3pm but that got called off understandably so I don't even have the peace of mind to know I'll be burning some calories off later...naturally that will mean I will punish myself more through bingeing.

This year was going to be my year, I'm turning 30 so I was determined to get 'in shape' lose my excess fat from all the yo-yo fluctuations I've had with my weight and go into my 30's in the shape of my life.

This year started off well, I trained loads and didn't even think about binging bad foods really. Sure I had extra portions than a normal person but I was eating pretty clean food.

I've been trying to start my own business and at one stage it looked like I had signed up two clients. Naturally I was in a good mood and I even manage to keep up meal prep.

When it became apparent I wasn't going to seal the clients (beginning of Feb), all my habits and bad eating patterns started up again. 

Ordering Deliveroos, eating Fish & Chips, KFC and copious amounts of sweets instead of getting my head down and working.

I'm self-aware to know that my mood is volatile based on my self-actualisation through work, when it's 'going well' or I can see the light - I get into flow states and respect myself as a human. I work hard, eat well and train well.

As soon as I get the slightest knockback or when I can't push myself to finish the list of tasks I need to do to move forward, I reward myself with a binge to try and escape my feelings and emotions.

I'm starting to think I may have adhd after I saw a video today from a girl who mentioned people with adhd have lower dopamine levels so look to get as much dopamine from sources as possible. It could explain why I can't get off my phone, LinkedIn and I can rarely stop my binges.

For the record, on the surface I don't look like an overweight person. I personally hate my body though and often look at old pictures of myself and notice how strong my jawline was/is. When I look at pictures of myself today and two weeks ago, I just see someone who is fat. Even though I'm often complimented for how I look. I don't say that to brag but I say that to give context of my appearance and how people see me versus how I see myself.

Anyway, this has been therapeutic in a way. I'm sorry for waffling on, I hope to get stuck into this forum and help other people where I can and learn from one another.",1645191380.0

BED not an addiction information,36,suz99h,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/suz99h/bed_not_an_addiction_information/,10,"Because I truly believe knowledge is power here is some information that I hope someone might find enlightening or helpful. I've been in dark places in the past, trying to understand why I binge and feeling like a failure for ""not being able to control myself.""

So for a long time BED was simply thought of as an addiction. But when psychologists and psychiatrists began to study and research BED they found that it is not an addiction, it's much more closely aligned with obsessive compulsive disorder or an impulse disorder. It's now classified by the APA in the DSM-5 as an Eating Disorder. What this means is the classic (and greatly simplified) presentation of someone with BED is someone who obsesses over food gives in to a compulsion, feels shame/regret which creates a negative feedback cycle. 

OA may work for some people (and if it works for you that's really great) but since it's not an addiction, the idea of restricting and self shaming (having to declare when you overeat, share if you've eaten something ""bad"", etc...) can be really detrimental to someone trying to overcome BED. Again, if OA works for you then I think that's really awesome. If you're finding it doesn't work for you, it might be because you would do better with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. With BED many of us classify foods as ""good"" or ""bad"" and when we eat something ""bad"" we feel as if we failed. Those feelings of failure lead to guilt/shame, guilt and shame build up and it becomes easy to give in to the compulsion to binge again. 

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy helps people realize that categories such as ""good"" and ""bad"" are completely subjective. That diet culture, at some point, has labeled every food as ""bad."" The body can handle things in portions (unless you have a medical or GI reason for not eating a particular food). By restricting, your brain begins to obsess. Instead, many find it helpful to realize that food choices can be neutral. Food is fuel. Let's take the emotions out of it and see food as fact. Exposure therapy, body neutrality, acceptance, mindfulness, regular eating (three meals and two snacks a day) are all tools that people use to successfully overcome BED. There can be hormonal imbalances and other factors that can increase disordered eating, which is why it is so important to reach out to a professional who specializes in eating disorders. 

This stuff is really challenging and it helps to have a team on your side. I hope this helps. From my personal journey with BED, group therapy, regular therapy sessions, reading, understanding and accepting have all gotten me to a much healthier place. There are so many complex social and individual pressures that get played out through our bodies. Being mindful of the fact that we have deeply engrained ideas about food, body weight and shape, weight = status and a myriad of other factors, can help shed some light on behaviors.

I know when I have any alcohol I get major carb cravings. I had a glass of wine and made a GIGANTIC bowl of popcorn for myself. Even though I've blown my calorie budget for the day, it helps when I remember that even people who don't struggle with an eating disorder have off days or even off weeks... How else would they gain weight and how else would diet culture be so persistent, you know?

A year ago, I would have let this day of weakness turn into a week or a month of weakness. I've found there is a point in recovery where you have to not beat yourself up and consider that overreating occasionally is not necessarily the ED, but just you being human. We aren't perfect.

The popcorn was delicious, the wine was delicious, but I'm back to my prepared meals tomorrow.

im always willing to challenge myself though. im honestly willing to do anything for any kind of money right now, considering i still have 2 trips to pay for. im trying hard to commend myself for the work i did do so far yet it still doesnt feel like enough. 

plus this is kinda irrelevant but i need to get it out there. im also terrified for tomorrow because its when i find out whether my hair that i damaged very badly can be rescued or if i have to chop it all off and start growing it all over again. if i chop it off my body changes will be alot more noticeable and im scared im gonna hate it (plus im amab non binary so im terrified of looking like a man again)

if you want to recover, do NOT restrict, it will not fix your emotions, mental health or relationship with food.

it’s a mental disorder, not a “fat” disorder. it’s not about your body weight. 

part of recovery is to unlearn the “i’ve already failed so why not” and to stop with the “if i don’t eat today i can eat everything tomorrow” etc

recovery is when your learning how to handle your emotions in healthy ways. recovery takes time, but it’s worth it every single step away from the illness and towards being better.

i would highly suggest having both a therapist or an other emotional suport system, as well as a dietitian or a doctor who can help you.

you may feel like you’re only extremely hungry or extremely full. your body needs time to adjust to what is healthy for you, and a dietitian and a therapist can really help to make sure you know how to handle it.

binging is not about weight. it’s about emotions. and it doesn’t do anything good to purposely hurt yourself to loose weight, when that’s not what recovery is.

Contrave - my experience,5,suya6p,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/suya6p/contrave_my_experience/,1,"TW - mention of trigger food

I recall some old posts on here about Contrave for treating BED. I thought I would share my experience with it since I've now been on it for 3 months.

I have found it to be very effective, as long as you can get all the way to the maximum dose. At the lower doses I didn't really see any difference in my hunger or urge to binge. Now that I've been at the maximum dose since the first week of January I've lost 45 lbs and have had a significant reduction in overall hunger and no urges to binge. I've even been able buy my biggest trigger food (potato chips) and forgot I even had them in the kitchen.

The only drawback that I've found with it is the cost, because it isn't typically covered by insurance. There is a special program for people who pay cash or have a very high copay where you can get it for $99 per month - even that is pricey though. The other issue I had was severe constipation at the highest dose. I had to double my water intake and increase my fiber in order to prevent it. There's also a warning for seizures, so anyone with a history of seizures cannot take it.

I just thought I'd share for anyone who might be looking for a medication option to help. I also recommend doing therapy at the same time, if you can afford it, because the medication works great but as soon as you go off of it the urge to binge will come back.",1645129261.0

She helped me or idk maybe the talking part helped me to think clearly. I'm hestitaing to go again because opening up to a stranger is not easy. It's always hard for me to talk to someone even my friends. I always tell them what I was going through after I overcome it but not while I'm struggling.

I work in healthcare, I have a normal BMI (just!) and have kept this secret for many, many years.

I have a history of anxiety/OCD but don't want to go to a doctor about this because of my profession and I don't think it will help anyway - I am not going to stop dieting because I am unhappy with how big I am and from what I understand no amount of therapy will help with BED whilst I have that attitude.

 I hide wrappers of what I've done.... Binging up to 6000 calories a time..... Then I undergo extreme exercise and dieting..... Repeat.
I spiral mainly when confronted with stressful situations, for example yesterday someone hit my car and I am wracked with anxiety about dealing with the garage/insurance.
I don't want to sound so self-pitying but I'm at the point where I feel like I just want to die. I'm such a mess when I do this, I get nothing done, just become a fat slob.

Not only are you feeling physically sick and emotionally disturbed but now also feeling paranoid what if you damaged your stomach what if you really did it this time and something messed up is happening?! And as those what if thoughts go through your head you feel even worse.. well I had that. I've binge during the night early morning and I was sick all day. I went to the washroom right after I laid down in bed I threw up a lot. and again and again.. (not on purpose) finally I got strength to get up I went to the washroom again it took more Pepto-Bismol I took gravel brushed my teeth got myself a glass of ginger ale, stirred.. a little bit of Gatorade, took some Gravol, tidied up now I'm finally comfortable in bed with a cold washcloth over my forehead..

I called my aunt while I was first throwing up just for like support over the phone. I just told her I over ate (I didn't tell her my full problem) she said that since it was hours and hours ago that I ate that it should be out of my system by now and that I probably need to eat toast or something. I told her ""I'm sick because I overate how would eating more make me feel better?!"" I totally get sometimes you need to eat to feel better but I don't think that's the case when the problem is that you wait too much.
The reality that it was hours and hours ago that I had lost ate started to scare me.. either that just shows exactly how much I overate , or maybe there's more to the problem.. both factors just made me paranoid.

Anyways when you're in a position like this what do you do to make yourself feel better? IS eating something ever an option? While I was talking to her earlier too I was also experiencing heartburn it was just all so bad.. now I feel mostly emptied out but right now I'm just slowly drinking my water and ginger ale..",1645086812.0
in shock at how much I've spend to try and lose weight,15,su7esx,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/su7esx/in_shock_at_how_much_ive_spend_to_try_and_lose/,4,"I've got a huge problem with binge eating. I've bought nutrition plans, workout plans, PT sessions, gym memberships, signed up to weight loss clubs, downloaded apps, bought motivating books and audiobooks, had ongoing therapy to explore the issues behind why I binge. Earlier today I thought to myself, I wonder how much I've actually spend trying to lose weight... now this past year will definitely have been higher than an average year because I've ramped up the therapy sessions, but in the last 12 months I have spent almost £3,000 (approx $4,000) to try and lose weight. 

£3,000. Fucking. Pounds.

And all I have to show for it is a slideshow of 'starting' progress pictures, and more clothes in my wardrobe that no longer fit. I'm getting married this summer and already know I'm going to look like a great white whale in my wedding dress. I could have saved that money and been able to go on a honeymoon with my hubby to be.

I started my first diet when I was 20, so I've been dieting for a third of my life. Even conservatively saying I've only spent half of that amount in an average year, I've probably spent around £16,500 (approx $22,500) trying to lose weight in the past decade. 

What have I achieved in that time and for that money? Well I've put on about 40kg/6 stone, lost all my confidence, lost all faith and trust in myself, and gained anxiety and depression. 

I just can't stop myself from snacking and binge eating. My therapist wants me to find the emotional reason behind why I binge eat but I don't think there is an emotional reason. I think I'm just a greedy fat bastard with no self control. I'm honestly at the end of my tether and don't know what to do.

Once I saw those numbers I felt like I needed to tell someone and get this off my chest but I'm too ashamed to tell my friends and family and have them know how stupid and weak willed I am. So instead you lovely Internet strangers get to see my ramblings, sorry",1645048169.0

A few people suggested that I take a more lenient approach to my dieting habits, which has for the most part worked for me. I try to incorporate foods I like into my diet and overall try not to be too hard on myself when I indulge a bit. 

Today, I had a pretty awful rough patch after failing my driver's test. I went home not feeling hungry at all, but made a Facebook post about today just being an off day. My friend suggested that I take myself out on a date and just have fun for the day, so I treated myself to an afternoon downtown. Went shopping and looked at some neat art, and figured, hey I've been pretty consistent about dieting lately, why not enjoy some nice food while I'm here? 

It started off reasonable enough. A small bowl of chicken tikka masala, a little bag of popcorn, a burrito bowl. Then my sweet tooth kicked in, and I knew it would get rough. Bought a brownie and ate it halfway, then got two scoops of homemade ice cream, and then against my better judgment I bought a crepe. It wasn't until I was almost done that I realized, ""Shit, I've eaten way too much today, if I finish this I will surely vomit."" And so instead of finishing it like my body wanted me to do, I threw the rest of it out. It wasn't like I spent too much on it either so I don't feel particularly bad about it. Then I caught my bus and my stomach began to settle, but I'm definitely full. I highly doubt I'll want to eat much more today; I'm probably gonna be filled up until tomorrow morning. Overall, despite eating more than planned, I walked away from today with a few neat purchases, some things I want to buy for my next downtown trip (that aren't food), and I'm feeling proud of myself for stopping myself mid-binge. I didn't even need to call for help in the middle and I don't feel gross or bad about today. I may feel bloated or have body image issues tomorrow, but I won't punish myself for today.

Prom in my contry is different from the american one. All girls have these beautiful dresses you invite all your relatives and its just so fancy and it happens once in your life. I also have beautiful dress that I absolutely love but Im just borrowing it (most girls do) and when I was trying it on it fitted me really well but since than I gained 5 kg and I cant try the dress again untill the day the prom is on. Im so scared it will not fit and I just keep eating and gaining weight and I cant stop. All girls around me stopped eating so they could all be skinny on the prom which doesnt help me at all.

Later I ate half a tub of hummus with almost an entire bag of Parmesan and garlic pita chips. Then I had two flour tortillas with a leftover sweet green salad inside them. Then for dinner I just had a hot pocket and a homemade pizza bagel with tomato sauce and cheese. 

I have such bad heartburn and feel overly full. I wasn’t even hungry for dinner tonight but wanted to eat for comfort, but now I’m emotional about it.

I’ve struggled with BED for as long as I can remember. My trigger foods are ice cream and cereal for sure. I’ve tried mindful eating, but for me that’s mindfully eating a whole box of cereal… aka binging. About a week ago, I started the elimination diet to figure out some food allergies (not to lose weight). I cut out all processed stuff, dairy, and gluten. I’ve noticed that while I still want my Ben & Jerry’s phish food ice cream, I don’t have the desire to binge as much. I have cravings, but they’re not the same. I think what works for me is having this all or nothing approach. Knowing I can’t eat ANYTHING processed pushes it out of my brain, whereas if I said “oh I can have a little ice cream” I would eat the whole pint x3. Does anyone else feel this way? It’s probably not a good way to handle BED long term but it’s been working for me so far. It will be interesting when I start reintroducing foods into my diet and seeing if the urge to binge comes back.",1644969884.0

Over the past about 5 years I've gained around about 30kg. I started gaining weight after I settled down with my husband, I noticed. However, my husband and I are currently long distance, and the last time I saw him he did comment on my weight. He wasn't horrible, just stated that he's noticed I've gained a bit and just to be careful for my health. I've never been a healthy weight, I've always been at least slightly overweight, so I didn't take offence to what he said because I am now obese, and I'm getting to the point where soon, I'm gonna be more than just slightly obese. 

I tend to do quite well during the day, but that's because I'm busy at work. I will have breakfast, which is cereal or toast and an apple and coffee. For my first break at work I usually have a cereal bar and an orange. My lunch is usually an instant noodle or left over food from dinner the night before. And on my third break I tend to have a little piece of chocolate. 

When I get home, I make tea. Usually rice with something or pasta, or some soup and bread. I do tend to have at least one kind of vegetable in every meal. However after tea, I can't stop myself. I'm just eating everything in sight. Biscuits, chocolate, crisps, yogurt. I tend to avoid the fruit, however. I'm not even that hungry, just eating for the sake of eating. I've started using my fitness Pal and have noticed I average eating about 3500 calories per day, double what my target is for me to lose weight. 

I know I maybe need something to keep me busy, but I get bored very quickly so if I take a hobby up, I quickly lose interest and don't do it anymore, or I can eat while doing it anyway. I told myself, today is gonna be the day I take better care of myself. But straight after having my tea, I ate 5 little chocolate bars, 2 packets of crisps and some caramel treats, and I still feel like I want to eat more. I feel disgusted at myself afterwards everytime I overeat like this, but I still do it every day. However I also tend to find, even when I do eat healthier, I feel hungrier. 

I'm seeing my husband in 10 days. I've gained more weight since I last saw him but I can't stop myself from eating, no matter how hard I try. I have no self control or willpower at all. Does anyone have any advice at how to start? Thank you for any help.",1644955227.0

Last night, I told my mom I’m really stressed out because everything is my life is f*cked over right now and that I have no outlets. She told me to binge on sweets. I’m sick of being pointed at even when I’m trying hard and succeeding. I told her that she’s deplorable and that she’ll never understand me. She said I know you hate me.

I’m tired of my extended family criticizing me for not having a job and it affecting my parents, who proceed to give me “reality checks.”

At my worst, I weighed 100 kg. I’d lose 10, 20 kg and then binge it all back - over and over again.

The last years I have been breaking my head in trying to understand what it is about binge eating that benefits me so much.

Obviously when I am stressed the thought of cheese nachos with fries coke and milk chocolate make my brain happy and makes me feel like it can get me through the day. 

That food is the only reliable source which always lifts me up and never disappoints.

But there is more to it…

I think I enjoy using my binge eating as a security blanket.

I enjoy bingeing and absolving myself of and shedding all expectations and responsibilities, being a rebellious child who doesn’t give a fuck about anything except for instant, all-consuming gratification.

I can use being physically “imperfect” and not being whatever society expects me to look like as a coping mechanism. 

I can blame EVERYTHING on my fat - because it’s convenient. 

No / few friends? Because I’m fat.

Trouble socializing? Because I’m fat.

Crush rejected me? Because I’m fat.

Sabotaging/avoiding dating?  Because I’m fat.

Unmarried without kids?  Because I’m fat.

Academically unsuccessful?  Because I’m fat.

Not taken seriously at work?  Because I’m fat.

I can remove and dodge all societal expectations of me. 

Pretend that the entire world treats me unfairly just because of it and that my failures and shortcomings are not my fault.

Yes, there are biased people but your body doesn’t cause everything that is going wrong.

Confidence, personality, strength, resilience, vulnerability, humor - have FAR more of an impact on your personal life.

I don’t know if I’m doing well,1,ssf2be,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/ssf2be/i_dont_know_if_im_doing_well/,4,"My mom just told me I’m bigger and I’m feeling a bit triggered. I first started gaining weight in November 2020, so being fat is new to me. I’m coming from extreme fasting/restriction. I decided to finally stop when I stupidly gave blood and was also fasting one day. However after i started eating regularly and feeling better, I noticed I had an extreme anxiety about feeling hungry. So I would overeat daily whilst also not exercising or anything. I’m very obese coming from normal weight, and have decided to get a dietitian. 

Personally I believe my eating is a lot more consistent and ultimately, less. But because I’m still obese and don’t appear to be losing any weight (or even getting bigger) though my clothes feel the same for a few months now, is immediately losing weight a sign you’re better? I don’t check the scale. I’m honestly at a loss. Other people seem to stop bingeing/overeating and immediately lose weight. But I feel like my body is just sticking around at this weight and it’s either starve or nothing. 

Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice? Keep eating? How do you know how much is enough?",1644857153.0

The corporate innovation on sugar cane

The bad little girl wanting ice cream on weekdays

The excess,

which does not come off in the stream,

which does not erode as the rocks do,

which does not care, not for one moment

that it is your best friend’s wedding

The cheese dust, the brownie batter,

the four cool whip tubs in the trash can

The hours between and the hours

with fingers in chip bags or *click*\-fizzing coke tabs

The hunger, wherever it comes from,

besides from the stomach

The 6:00 AM binges and *bad, this is bad*

And still, the pink thing starving

goes on with its pleading and plotting

The gurgle of wanting

The toast expectations

The plate by the bedside,

the basket, the frosting

The bad little girl wanting ice cream for dinner

And all the while, waiting,

impatient, imperfect

The feast and the danger,

the leaden consumption,

the guilt and the anger,

the pink thing so *vicious—*

and me, in this body

This body, this body

Me, with these hands

pulling open the cupboard

Me, with this mouth

wide and ready, revealing

the pink starving thing

I made myself cooked meals and portion controlled. No snacks, no junk just purely healthy meals and water. I'm gonna be honest and say I had absolutely no withdrawal at all and I believe it's because I was doing daily breathing exercises, cold showers and daily walks. I also decided I would move in with my parents temporarily and that meant I had to share a fridge. I was more conscious about what I was using as I couldn't eat all the food. A month later I joined the gym and went everyday because I felt a buzz. 6 weeks in and I've lost a lot of weight, when I go jogging, I feel incredibly light and full of energy. I don't think about junk at all and I don't feel the urge to binge. When people ask if I want a cookie or something unhealthy I can easily say no. Even when my mom says things like ""it's okay to treat yourself once in a while"", I tell her that my body doesn't crave it anymore.

1 Step Back Experience,3,ss0lc5,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/ss0lc5/1_step_back_experience/,1,"Hey everyone. My last post, believe was about taking 2 steps forward, 1 step back. It was mostly focused on the 2 steps forward part. Well this will be about the 1 step back that will happen, and does. Making sure I don’t do anymore steps back though. Tonight and last night was a major step back. 

Lately I’ve been on a roll, momentum, with therapy, using tips I shared (previous post here believe) and working out instead of binging, any time of body movement will work though too. However, the other day, there became this wave of loneliness. A wave of stress. Also was triggered from an interaction on Reddit (not this group) and it just hit me. Fu** it, my brain said. 

Instead of dealing with it, both yesterday and today, binged. Instead of beating myself up over it though, focusing on the fact I didn’t order in, I binged on foods that are more vegetarian, and that there have been more days of not binging. Then mind says “screw it”, let’s binge, we need comfort. Realizing tomorrow will need to be a day where it’s about on track. Because the feeling of the recovery and freedom is such a high. Doesn’t come immediately but in time it builds up. Anyway I wanted to share, because this is a journey. 

Learning there’s a lot of triggers, and work in progress. You all are very inspirational and motivation for many of things. Your sharing, comments, and all really help me try to get to the “other side of this” as that’s my goal, and to help others do the same. 

Not enough discussion, help, treatment and tools for BED, 

that will change.

I don't keep a lot of sweets or snacks such as chips in the house in order to lower temptation. I sometimes go to the store specifically to buy those items to binge on, but that's another problem for another day. My main focus right now is on my fast food binges. Since New Years, I have binged on fast food/takeout almost every single day. Whether it be McDonalds, Wendys, Culvers, Little Caesars, Chick-Fil-A, or Buffalo Wild Wings, I eat mass amounts of food whenever I binge always costing me between $15 and $40. Tonight was the final straw. I pulled out of Wendys and then immediately into McDonalds, getting my go-to binge items from both. This is killing me both physically and financially.

I can't even pinpoint an exact trigger for these binges other than maybe boredom? But not boredom in the sense of ""I'm bored"" but boredom in the sense of ""Meals I cook are not as exciting as the meals I binge on."" I am also not at all mindful when I eat, as a big ""routine"" of my binges is putting on a long YouTube gameplay video and indulging in my food.

I wake up feeling all those same feelings. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that there seems to be a level of understanding in our culture with people who struggle with alcohol. Even going as far as to say its not the individuals fault. But then culturally we don't look at BED, or even food addiction, in the same light.  I just want to say I am proud of all of you for not giving up, because in my experience, this shit is harder to master than alcohol, and I was an everyday (sometimes morning) drinking.

Lastly, there is an app called The Alcohol Experiment. Its a 30 day experiment into not drinking. There are daily videos and journaling questions that explore the brain and habits. Although its centered around alcohol, I believe you could easily swap it for any other sort of habitual behavior. Ive worked it through with binge eating and its helped me a lot.",1644684150.0

I’m naturally petite. The problem is that when I do put on a few pounds it’s really obvious. I have a big issue with binge eating I’ve probably had this problem since I was a teenager if I’m honest. I’m in my 30s now and I can look back and see that food has always been a problem for me.

However I really started putting on weight in my 20s. Sometimes I beat myself up because I think I’m worrying over nothing. In terms of the general population, I’m a size (US 4) that a lot of women would love to be and so I kind of feel like I don’t have a right to say I have a binge eating disorder or to seek help or to go on a diet.

Lately I’ve been hoping to lose 10 lb after putting on a fair bit of weight around my tummy and legs, mostly because of binging and eating takeout food et cetera. not only does it make me unhappy with the way I look but of course I feel like crap all the time as well. I’ve been trying for about the past two months. Ill eat pretty well through the week and then binge all weekend or late one night. 

I’m eating enough calories and I’m eating a decent amount of protein et cetera but it’s really like a mind game. It’s almost like a part of my weekend schedule is the actual binge eating. I can feel myself looking forward to it. I can feel myself planning what I’m going to have.

Of course I then look in the mirror still feel unhappy about the way I look and then beat myself up binging. I don’t really know why I’m writing this I guess it’s so that I can admit that this is a problem for me. I just feel really awkward about the whole thing because I’m only 120lbs… and to society in general that’s not overweight at all. But it isn’t right for me, I only need/want to drop 10lbs, but my eating habit needs to change for good…. 

Last night I watched something where the characters were eating nachos. Then at 1am I had to get out of bed a make some. I couldn’t sleep because my mind wouldn’t stop thinking about it. Then of course I felt like shit physically and emotionally as I got back into bed.

Today I’ve eaten … a croissant, more nachos… this time with beef, a scone with jam and cream, a chocolate eclair and then I ordered TWO baked cookie dough desserts from Uber Eats.

Now that I’m an adult and some of my days are booked for 12 hours, I know what they mean. I’ll have work in the morning and class at night, and I’ll consciously decide not to eat before or during work because it’s easier, I’m not hungry, etc. my first meal ends up being at 4 pm after I’ve been up for 8 hours. By that time I’m definitely hungry. And even though I eat something at 4 pm, by the time I get back from class at 10:30 pm, I’m ready to f*cking binge because I only ate one normal sized meal at 4 pm when I should’ve eaten at least two during a full day of working and going to class.

This is a key factor in my binge eating, and it’s easily solved by eating before work or bringing a protein smoothie (I work in a retail setting, I’m on my feet and using my hands so I need something that’s easy to eat/drink.)

I thought this might help some people whose binge eating is partially due to not eating enough during a busy day. You might have to “force” yourself to eat normal size meals at regular intervals to avoid binge eating at the end of the day.

i’m 16 (turning 17 in a month) and i’ve been struggling with food issues my whole life. i was never particularly big but i grew up as a chubby kid.  

my older sister used to constantly torment me about my weight since she was much slimmer than me and i think that’s how my insecurities began at a very early age. 

i’ve had numerous phases where i would diet my whole teenage life, but on new years day 2020 my grandmother ended up in the hospital. i felt absolutely awful and started starving myself. not sure why, a lot of people say they starve themselves because they feel like they have no control, but i don’t even know anymore. 

i stopped eating out of pure sadness. i would eat lunch and then maybe force myself to eat some eggs for dinner every other day. she died in febuary and by then not eating simply became a habit.

i completely lost my apetite and would mostly eat one meal a day, some days i would eat a little bit more but would always fall back. it wasn’t even intentional ( i think ) but i would just rarely be hungry.

this lasted until may i think. i had lost about 12 kgs all together. after many months of not eating, i started binging. the binging is still happening. 

i tried everything, but i feel like the thought of food is ruining me, i just wanna live a normal life and stop thinking about food 24/7.  i’ve even been going to the gym since september but it’s not helping at all. 

i still don’t have a lot of apetite but it’s like my brain forces me to eat beyond my limits, which in the end is not only mentally, but phisically painful l as i have a lot of stomach problems now.

Help,2,sq6hqx,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sq6hqx/help/,2,"Hi, I believe I need some help related to binge eating.

I will try to give some context: I'm 15 and since a couple weeks ago I spend almost the whole day with my mother at her bar.

I got on a calorie deficit around Christmas to try to lose weight (I'm a little skinny fat) and I had days in which I overate a little bit, but didn't really give it any importance, as January became a good month for my diet and my workouts.

However, since I stopped going home because of a bad situation with my flatmate, I spend the whole day here and I have realized that I'm prone to binge eating probably more than a thousand calories (apart from the breakfast and lunch on that days) on sweets (croissants, cookies, omelette, croissants) during certain days, and I just feel like I can't control myself. It has just happened for five or six days more or less now but I feel awful, I will eat till I feel like I'm about to throw out and won't stop until the next day. Then a day or two of eating on a calorie deficit and then back again to binge eating. My mother tells me to eat, like if it isn't wrong, and I'm really terrified I can't control myself. I have been trying to remember and I have had binge eating episodes for a while but not as big as they are being lately.

Today I have had a couple coffees (I like coffee, I don't see that as a problem). My plan was to have a coffee with a little sponge cake but I also had two churros and a little chocolate, and then I had another coffee. I'm a bit angry with myself but I believe it is somehow an achievement as I have been able to stop. I will now have a healthy dinner. I usually binge eat the whole day once I start, so I guess this is an achievement too.

My economic situation is not really good but I will try to get into the gym and get serious about my nutrition as soon as summer arrives. I don't know if being on a calorie deficit is good for my age either.
I'm really afraid I can't control myself and I'm tired of feeling angry with myself for this. I really fear this becoming a serious problem and worsening my health, but I also like this bar and I would like to work here in the future. Any advice?",1644605193.0

I said to him “if you wanted to lose 10 pounds, you would do it effortlessly and be successful.” He agreed that he could easily drop 10 pounds if he wanted to (he’s not overweight; doesn’t need to lose anything). I said “how then? How would you do it?” And he said “I just wouldn’t eat for a few days.” I was so triggered and said “but how can you do that!” And he said “it’s just a few days, the hunger goes away and if I set myself out to do something I’m just going to do it.” He didn’t say any of this to hurt me at all, he’s so sweet and loving, but it just made me realize how utterly fucking pathetic and incapable I am, that I can so desperately want to lose weight (because my weight is ruining my life) and yet be too weak and obsessed with food to actually do it.

The binges seem separate from any emotional issues too- I seem to binge just as much when I’m happy as when I’m stressed or sad. The only surefire way it seems to stop a binge after a meal is if there is simply no more food available for me to eat. Anybody else like this?

Maybe some hope for me,3,sooxej,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sooxej/maybe_some_hope_for_me/,1,"Hey I have no one in irl who would understand and needed to express this. Numbers mentioned

Background: originally a little overweight, lost enough with extreme exercise & restriction to become underweight. After the period of anorexia, I was dealing with binging fasting and exercise purging for a year. 

I had tons of injuries (still dealing with one) probably due to underfeuling. I finally had a complete breakdown after getting injured in Sept and spent a ton of time just binging and binging and binging. I exercised but only a little because of injuries and the fact that exercise was now associated with binging and that exhausting feeling of running on energy reserves that weren’t there. AKA fear of injury. So every time I did even light exercise, it would trigger me to binge. 

I stoped weighing myself until early Jan when I had a doctor appointment. Turns out I had binged my way up to a “normal” BMI. Right in the middle of the healthy BMI range. Not thin not fat (but in my dysmorphic mind I’m way disproportionately fat). 

I got anxious because it had been so easy in the past to gain weight and I couldn’t stop binging. 

And my injury flared up again in Jan so I stopped running. Back to light exercise and I started swimming once a week sometimes less. I probably strength trained just once, briefly. 

I also binged. A lot. Once a week and then sometimes multiple days in a row. I stopped weighing myself. I did still count my calories. 

This week I weighed myself and found out between Jan-Feb I ONLY GAINED A 1/2 LB. With my nonstop binging. 

So what I learned from this is that I was unintentionally restricting and my binges were evening things out. I’d believed that 1200-1400 was my maintenance (and even that is higher than I was eating in the throws of my sickness) but it seems like my maintenance is actually more like 1700-2000 per day depending on how hungry I am. For reference I’m 5’3”. 

I have started eating more every day, and more food means I can satisfy cravings as well as eat nutritious meals that satisfy my hunger. That may help stop binging. I’m going to stay off the scale until next month. I’m just so relieved that it doesn’t seem like I’m going to gain and gain until I’ve gained everything back and then some. I was seriously concerned and the body dysmorphia didn’t help. Seems like I can maintain and satisfy my hunger at this weight. 

This experience makes me feel like I can put food out of my mind. Anyway, I feel like the ED and exercise is about being out of sync with my body and hopefully I can reset myself. In a few months when I’m ready I’ll ramp up the exercise (trying for triathlon instead of marathon now because of I don’t think I can run long distances anymore) and I will eat and move in sync with my body. 

So I’m staying off the scale until next month and trying to put food out of my mind.",1644443334.0

I used to struggle a lot with what I believed to be BED. Never been officially diagnosed so I could be totally off the mark here but what I’ve read on this sub sounds like how I used to be.

Thing is, I don’t really “binge” like I used to. I still think about food quite a lot but not nearly as much, in fact I feel closer to how I used to before eating “took over my life”. My portions are literally half what they were at times. When I get take out it’s from a healthy restaurant unless my family/coworkers want to get junk food but I feel like that’s justified.

I see so many posts about people who have to mark a calendar and who struggle with stopping and I really feel for you guys because I’ve been through that horrible cycle but I’ve never had to mark a calendar or anything like that. It’s very hard to break but I don’t think it’s impossible to kind of get rid of that mentality.

It took a lot of work though. I had to start doing things that would take up more of my focus so I wouldn’t be tempted to eat or just resisting cravings overall and the more I do it the easier it gets. I started doing more productive stuff and going back to school has helped a fuck ton.

I guess what I’m asking is did I even have BED since it seems like people who have it on this sub have to regulate their meals and I kind of don’t/didn’t.

Screens During Meals,5,snrixb,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/snrixb/screens_during_meals/,11,"Hi all! I have diagnosed binge eating disorder by my prescriber (not therapist) but am between therapists right now so I can’t ask about this:

Does anyone have experience with NEEDING to look at a screen while eating? If I’m eating alone I will ALWAYS have tv show playing on my phone, and it’s usually one that I’ve seen a million times before. This applies to whether I’m bingeing or just eating normally. It’s like… this sad feeling when I don’t have something to watch while eating? Hard to explain. Almost like I’m upset that I’m wasting food on a moment where I could be enjoying it even more by pairing with TV. When I’m eating with others I save food for when I’ll be alone so I can watch with TV. I do have OCD but I haven’t found anything on how that would cause this.

Growing up, my family always ate in front of the TV. It was family time and we’d pick out a show together. I’m sure that has to do with it, but I don’t know how to put the puzzle pieces together and stop because I know it’s not healthy.

I’ll continue to keep trying to stop this, but for some reason I always do it again without realizing. Does anyone have experience with this?

I’m starting an ED IOP in a couple months so will get help soon, but in the meantime I would love to see what everyone’s opinions are.

ETA: After reading the comments and thinking deeply, I tried to imagine a life where I don’t use screens during meal time. In my imagination it kind of feels pointless I guess to eat if I’m not watching something or otherwise occupying my eyes. But that gave me a bit of motivation that maybe I can push past the sadness of eating without a screen and get to a point where I’m just not as interested in food as a “fun thing” because I’m not being entertained in the meantime.

When I was younger I was relatively secure in that fact. It didn't bother me that I was large and inactive, I enjoyed my video games and friends all the same. Now I am a bit older and I no longer feel that same way. 

My binge-eating and emotional eating tendencies have been a part of me as long as I can remember honestly. When I was overly upset as a child lock parents or granny would buy me treats to cheer me up. I suppose that is likely the beginning of my emotional attachment to food. I have memories of my father doing the same things. He would eating very little for dinner. No more and often less than you would expect a person to eat at a standard meal, especially for a larger man who worked a hard manual labor job. But without fail, most nights I would hear him rufling through the kitchen in the late hours after everyone had gone to bed. It was there that he would binge. Sometimes I'd sneak out of my room and watch him. It made me so sad and it saddens me to remember it. He passed away in late 2020 by suicide. My relationship with him was always a complicated one, (a history of emotional abuse and neglect) but I more than anything else always felt I credibly sad for him. I now feel that feeling 100x stronger as it has been compounded by my grief regarding him taking his own life and my own struggles will similar issues. I was always afraid I'd become him, and now I see that happening.

Fast forward to the present and I find myself doing exactly the same thing. I even live in the house he lived in my whole life. The same house he would binge in at 2 AM. The same house who's driveway he would take his own life in. The same house I currently sleep in. While I do not have a child of my own, I do have a roommate. And I find myself doing the same things to avoide his gaze. Eating has become a ritual the shame for me, one I do not wish to been seen partaking in. I hate it and I hate myself. As I type this I am eating food I shouldn't be eating and I am thinking thoughts I should not be thinking.

I've had BED ever since I was 10 I would say (but formally diagnosed just recently). It wasn't as bad then as it is now. I recently got OFFICIALLY diagnosed with ADD as well, which thankfully my physician was very helpful and sympathetic to because she also has it and I was put on Concerta to help both BED and ADD.

I feel like I am able to rationalize my expectations when it comes to family life, college, and current job responsibilities. The one thing that hasn't stopped is my BED. I basically have only been gaining weight so I decided to try and identify what exactly my triggers are.

Hunger is not my trigger. I get less hungry because of the meds but I can stop eating when I'm full and I eat relatively healthy meals. I do have moments of depression but basically only around my period. I do not really feel the urge to binge. I don't stress eat at all anymore. I do have the urge to binge in social situations where snacks are available. I have curbed this by eating before every single social event I go to. The trouble is that when everyone in the house is asleep and I'm sitting there watching TV I get the urge to binge.

Last night I ate a whole large bag of Hot Cheetos, a can of beefaroni, and a zebra cake. This of course is after I ate very healthy for a day. 

I don't keep snacks in the house. The cans of ravioli are there for the kids. I meticulously buy groceries to just have enough. So I just buy enough food for the kids because if I eat their food they don't have food. Most of the time I'm good about this. Same with me and my husbands food. I portion and measure everything that way we just have enough give or take a few servings extra. I don't spend money at work and buy unhealthy food. It's just at night and it drives me nuts.

""Recovery"" spirals into binge eating, gain 7kg in 2 months (wow!)


I never wanted to gain weight but after being forced into some hospital day trips and making my parents cry a few too many times, something in my brain snapped and I started eating. This was great until I started eating like I was preparing for a famine. I'm talking like up to maybe 6000 calories over the span of a day. 

I hate this more than anything but I can't stop. I am really not helping myself, I'm either binging or fasting, there is no in between. I haven't consistently eaten since my restricting days. Kind of wack but I think I was healthier then, despite being underweight. I'm still technically underweight but I don't look like it, the 7kg I gained is almost certainly just fat so I look bigger than I am. I just want my control back so badly. This is the worst part of my life so far. I started smoking cigarettes to punish myself and I smoke three times as much weed as I used to. I am broke as hell from drugs and food :(

I'm seeing my ED specialist tomorrow morning, not looking forward to my weekly weigh in. I gain like 3-5kg on the scale the day after a binge. I know it's mostly water because that much is impossible overnight but shit it sure makes me wish I could just stop existing.

I think I may have BED. I have depression and anxiety and have known for a while that eating is something I do to “distract” or “comfort” me when I’m feeling really depressed or anxious. I never thought it might be an eating disorder because I thought those were only for people who restrict their diets in some way. 

Lately I’ve really noticed that I feel like I actually have NO control over my consumption of sweets. Like zero control. It’s starting to worry me. I have two kids. I want to be healthy for them. I want to be healthy for me. Im scared for my health, but I feel like I CANNOT control myself. 

Im really just discovering that BED is a thing. I’m trying to find small steps to try and help myself. Does anyone have any tips for someone just starting to really try to stop binge eating?

&#x200B;

I usually end up getting upset with a bunch of small things building up and sometimes some bigger things until I either binge or refuse to eat. It's weird because I'll get nauseous when I'm upset then worry I'll just waste the food by eating it since maybe I'll end up vomiting (I never have but I'm still worried I will). Then as soon as I make myself eat I go overboard and just keep going with whatever looks good in that moment until I've already past full. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes I don't eat for hours to make sure I'm not upset while I eat but I have to eat at some point and then I'll overdo it once I get to that point. I'm not sure if I'm making it better or worse - if I'm improving or developing more bad habits because I end up bingeing at some point. I was doing good for so long then it comes back and I think in some aspects I'm doing better with eating but in others maybe it got worse? Just feels like I can't get control sometimes.",1644175571.0

Having trouble spacing out my meals,2,slx0kd,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/slx0kd/having_trouble_spacing_out_my_meals/,2,"Hey yall! So i need some advice. I always plan out what I'm going to eat the day before, and it's helpful for me to do that so that i have an idea of what I'm going to eat instead of making it up on the spot which could lead me to a binge.

The problem is, food is pretty much constantly on my mind. When i plan my meals before bed, all i can think about when I'm falling asleep is the food I'm going to eat tomorrow. As soon as I wake up, I immediately go to the kitchen and make breakfast. But then i get into the binging mindset and end up eating what I had planned for the whole day the first thing in the morning. Then I'm like, well shoot, I'm already at my calorie limit for the day and my stomach feels uncomfortable, so I'm just going to not eat for the rest of the day. Sometimes I'm successful and I follow a kind of OMAD structure for a while (which i know is terrible for anyone with an ED but what else can I do?)  but many times I'll end up binging at night because I haven't eaten since 6am. 

I have no idea how to stop this. I think it would be easier to just go OMAD, but I hate doing this every morning. It makes me feel so bloated and full. I'm lucky I'm online for school so i don't have to go out when i feel crappy from eating a day's worth of food, but i obviously won't be remote forever and this is not sustainable. I've tried setting timers between meals, finding distractions between mealtimes, or trying to at least have my one big meal later in the day instead of first thing in the morning. I don't know why i can't help it, but i know this can't keep happening or I'll never recover.

I die a little inside every time I see women saying “This habit is too strong. I can’t stop eating”. I die a little because that was me back in 2016. I was so confused and desperate because none of the methods to tame the binge worked for me. I needed to find my own way to binge freedom.

Here’s the good news: you’re not struggling with binge eating because you’re not self-disciplined enough or you have no willpower. Quite the opposite, most people struggling with binge eating are driven persons who have a lot of success in other areas of their life! It’s just that your striving for perfection, all-or-nothing type of thinking, negative self-talk prevent you from breaking the binge eating cycle.

Today I would like to share with you 9 steps I took to overcome binge eating.

I hope this video will show you how to find inner balance with food and what steps you can start taking right now to leave food guilt, restrictions, and cravings behind, so you can finally feel good in your body and create a calm mind.

Fast forward to now, I haven't binged in 5 days, I have been only eating one meal a day at less then 1200 calories. Based on my height I should be eating 1700-1800 calories a day but I'm eating way less than that. 

I'm being kind of extreme because I started getting chubby around 12 (worst timing) and by junior year in HS high I was obese. I spent my entire adolescence being fat and it sucked from bullying and I felt so ostracized and separate from other girls. I'm 22 now and I just want to be a ""normal"" girl, not a fat girl. I know a lot of this thinking is wrong and unhealthy, I should accept myself and all that, but when I've never known what it's like to be thin, it just weighs on me. 

How have you guys gotten past the impatience? My goal is to just retrain my brain to not always think about food.

to make matters worse i’ve recently quit my job and wasn’t supposed to be spending too much money cause i gotta live off my savings for a while yet i’ve been spending money on food every single day like i’ve got it and i literally don’t, i’m acting like a meth addict it’s not funny anymore i’m so worried. i tell my best friend i’m doing shit for college when in reality i have a binge planned and that’s why i can’t hang out with her. i’m telling people i can’t meet them because i think i might have covid but it’s literally a lie, i just wanna stay home and eat. i’ve been lying to everyone and i feel like shit

i don’t know what to do!!!!!!!!! this is fucking rock bottom again and i’m so tired of hitting it, of pretending like i’m doing alright, telling my parents i’m still doing my workouts when i don’t even go out on walks anymore cause i don’t wanna be seen nor perceived at all. i take this all back i just wanna be happy again",1644021251.0

For some background info, I'm a 27 yo woman. My fiance and I both have come to realize that we binge eat.... but its everyday. I haven't had a good life, not that it is an excuse but possibly plays a part? My dad died when I was 4, I was sexualy abused by someone in my house from 4-7. Emotionally and physically abused until 16. I also have stage 4 endometriosis, which pretty much dominated my life and health. I've had 1 out of 2 surgeries that I need to get it all out, I already feel immensely better. I'm ready to change the way I view food and life but I literally can't stop eating. I know diabetes runs in my family, and I'm unhealthy enough to worry I could get it. 
I eat and eat and eat, all while knowing full well what I'm doing to my body. Terrified. My fiance has degenerative disc disease, both of our diseases make day to day life hard. It's so hard to want to fight and be healthy when your life doesn't feel like something worth fighting for. 
When I was 17 my endo flared up so bad I couldn't hold food down without being in pain. I lost weight, fast, I was sick and the thinnest I'd ever been in a bad way. Since then I have gained over 130 pounds and I don't know how to stop.
If I get replies, thank you in advance. I'm happy to be part of this community and will hopefully find some help. I'm in need of tips, advice, stories, anything really to give me hope that I'm not hopeless.",1644103693.0

This is just a quick post to celebrate a win I had today!

I went on a loooong walk and, as planned, I had my lunch halfway round the route (10 miles away from home). 

This lunch is a shop-bought trigger for me (>!English seaside chips inna box with lashings of salt and vinegar!<), which I only allow myself to buy in this one specific place - when I have literally no option but to walk the 10 miles back home again!

Today, despite having “earned” the whole amount that I bought, I threw some away. 

I put the container down, thought “no; I’ve had enough; I don’t need to devour every last morsel” .. and threw it away. 

It’s not much. But it’s progress towards controlling my ED, and not letting it control me. 

Have a fab, recovery-filled day everyone!

Are the healthy options actually more calories than I think they are? What am I doing wrong? I'm trying to watch my portions but also be \~balanced\~. And who can I see to help me fix this? Would a therapist or dietitian be more helpful in getting my life more in order?

You all here in this group have really touched me in a way of inspiration and how so many are struggling. Little fuzzy tonight so I’m going to just try and get to the tips & update. 

Just thank you for sharing and caring, and please never give in or give up on this, while it may be something you’ll struggle with for a long period of time, maybe not too long. There is hope, you can overcome it, and remember, 2 steps forward, 1 step back. 

Update : Lately I’ve not binged. Being here, therapy, and a few fast tips I want to give below for you to try, if ever need a diversion of that craving coming on. 

**********
TIPS (what has worked for me and it’s crazy, but try it)

1) When a craving happens, I come on Reddit, and I make comments or browse, whatever. Also I drink 2 glasses of water when doing so. 

2) Put on really nice smelling hand lotion, and also, or try spraying a perfume or cologne on your wrist. Something about smells really help divert the intense temptation. 

3) Every day, even if just for a moment, whether in the morning or evening, wherever it is. Stand in front of a mirror and say I love you no matter what. Say it about 3 times. Everyday. And say I am moving past this binge eating disorder. Say this multiple times a day. 

And last quick tip, music. Major thing that helps me, get lost in some music and move. You don’t have to move but just listen to music you really enjoy or find new ones. Even can write or draw while listening.

Never ever give up. I know hell.
The hell of eating disorders. 

You can, you are, you will get through this. Fuck the scale, and forget the comparison of bodies, it’s all about how you feel and your health.

Keep moving, everyday, do the above tips and you may start to see a shift. 

I’m truly rooting for every single person on this, only we know what it’s like. You deserve better and you are going to have it.",1643944374.0

Probably like some of you guys I eat a lot for a quickie happiness (at any normal circunstancies or at any inconvenience), because of anxiety, because I never had a proper nutrition education as a kid or even unconsciously, just eating something small without even noticing.

Im also starting an intensive outpatient program on tuesday so im pretty pumped for that. the medication ive been recommended before is also meant to help control my binging. i havent been prescribed yet since there have been a few bumps in the road but im seeing a nurse practitioner next thursday for.a psych evaluation.

overall im pretty excited to start on this new journey, not only to quit binge eating but to also improve my relationship with food among other issues that i wont mention for the sake of relevance. ill probably post in other subreddits about other things but im not entirely sure yet. im posting this right now so i can hold myself accountable. i plan on posting here weekly until I hit a month, then ill go monthly after that probably until i hit a year.

just a thought,7,sjupat,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sjupat/just_a_thought/,4,"so to preface this is the day after a very big binge. it had just hit afternoon around 12 pm and i finally got out of bed to try eat something nutritious as i had gotten hungry. I felt super lightheaded and nauseous and had to keep sitting down in between cooking my oats. i think this was because of all the sugar i consumed yesterday. During my cooking struggle, my mom walks in and checks on me, i tell her i’m feeling super weak but trying to cook my favorite oatmeal. she says something like you need to eat asap!! and i responded something like yeah i know i’m currently trying to haha. I then told her that i ate so much yesterday though. she goes “ yeah but that was yesterday.” I know this is pretty simple but my brain has been stuck in ruminating over the past mistakes i’ve made with my eating disorder and how much money i’ve blown on binges. my mom saying this made a lightbulb turn on for me. The reason i keep binging is because i keep reminding myself of failures i’ve made when i’m on a good eating and working out streak. I think what i want to try focus on now, is the moment i am in currently. Being more present. Sure i’m going to be making goals and planning things career wise. But i want to not let my mind wander off to the past as easily. That person was not me and it will no longer be me. I know better and i know better coping mechanisms. I just have to keep consistent and keep practicing my mindfulness in regards to how i talk to myself, how i sit down to eat, how i speak to others, and how i take care of myself. I want to be fully here and feel all the feelings that might come up and lead to thoughts telling me to binge. stuffing it away won’t be sustainable long term. And quite honestly i felt like i hit my rock bottom last night. I never want to feel that bad/sick and guilty ever again. i don’t deserve it and neither do you.

Why I binge,11,sjjtse,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sjjtse/why_i_binge/,6,"This is my first post on here. I'm trying to stop binging (it's been years) and I thought that listing all of the reasons why I binge might be helpful. Not really sure what I want from this. Maybe some feedback? Advice? Sorry it's a bit long.

  

*  **Because I am overwhelmed**   
There are too many things going on around me. I have too many things to do and getting it all done seems impossible. I don’t know where to start, I don’t know how much is manageable for me to get done in one day. If I try to get my head straight and figure out what to start with my head will start to hurt, my eyes will feel sore, my body will feel uncomfortable. It will feel like I need to eat. 
*  **Because I don’t realize I’m binging**   
I’ll eat too much frequently. I won’t keep track of when I eat and then just decide that it’s time to eat again when I just ate.
* **Because I don’t stay full**  
 If I eat a meal I think is healthy and balanced with a portion that I think is appropriate, I’ll feel “satisfied”, but I won’t the fullness I usually feel. And then when my stomach gets a bit empty a little while later I’ll feel like I haven’t eaten in a long time. 
* **Because I can’t stop thinking about food**  
If I’m trying to eat healthy or prevent a binge, that’s all I’ll think about. If I’m not worried about preventing binges, I’ll think about what I could eat and when and when I could binge. I’ll think about the next opportunity for me to be alone and eat however much and whatever I want.
* **Because I feel like I’ll miss out on good food**  
If there’s something I really want, or something that tastes really good, I feel like I’ll miss out if I don’t eat as much of it as possible. Even if I know that no one else is likely to eat it for a long time.
* **Because I can’t decide what to eat**  
Sometimes I want to eat something that’s good for me, something that’s an actual meal. But there won’t be something at home that I could make into a meal. Or there won’t be something that could easily and quickly be made into a meal. Sometimes there will be something my mom made, but I really won’t like it, or it’s very unhealthy, or it’s both. And so while I’m looking for something to eat, I’ll start eating crackers with peanut butter, or whatever sweet thing is nearby, or whatever small snack food is nearby. And soon I’m full on empty calories and I don’t want to find something to eat anymore. 
* **Because I don’t feel well or I’m tired**  
If I don’t feel well I want some comfort, and I find that in sweet food, so when my willpower is down, I’ll binge on a lot of sweets. And when I’m tired I won’t have the willpower to even warm something up so I’ll eat whatever is the easiest, which is usually not good. 
* **Because I’m trying to relax**  
Sometimes I’ll have some time off, or some time when I’m alone and I don’t need to rush and do things and I’ll want to relax. And I don’t really know how to relax, so I’ll eat instead.",1643896663.0

I need help in figuring how to navigate this situation and maybe support and reassurance. Also, this might be a question that others are facing themselves right now and want to know what to do, so hopefully this can help some people out there. 

I have an engagement party coming, one of my best friends is getting married and the invite came out this week. It's on March 12th. Many people have seen me at around the 215lbs mark and do know I've gained quite a bit of weight over the years. But at the moment I'm struggling to get out of the 250's. There are also some people in his family and friends that will not have seen me in 10 years due to me being away at college and off social media and will not have seen me since I was in the 170-180 region around 2013. 

I now know that BED has consumed my life. All I think about is dieting, calorie restriction and I know that that causes me to binge hard if and when I eventually cave in. So I'm currently in that destructive loop and I'm having a real struggle getting out of it right now. I have promised myself to get out of the 200's by the end of this year and although I have plenty of time to be chipping away at that goal, I don't have much time at all before this party. I don't know what to do. Part of me is just saying suck it up, lose what you can realistically for the month, but attend for your friend..people will notice, most won't really care and the night will pass like any other night will. But there is a part of me is thinking run, hide, avoid.. typical BED behaviour. Tell your friend that your social anxiety is through the roof because of this disorder and you can't attend. He would be surprised to hear I'm going through so much stress over this and would tell me to relax and don't worry about showing up, I know he would. The final option is the worst one and the one I've been using when I don't really care about the people as much and that is lie, just say you can't make it. But this would almost be like lying to family and I'd love to either attend or be honest about my problem and let him know I can't attend because of that. Both are wins and losses for different reasons.

Any ideas guys? The larger problem is of course my disorder, I need to get out of this hole this year. But the lesser, more immediate problem is facing this party as who I am now, or not facing at all. Any help?",1643894990.0

One week's experience on Bupropion/Naltrexone,2,sjoocf,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sjoocf/one_weeks_experience_on_bupropionnaltrexone/,2,"I have been taking Contrave(Bupropion/Naltrexone) for one week. Taking the generic one as Bupropion 150/ Naltrexone 12.5 ( Contrave is not available in my country)

I have been diagnosed with  eating disorder, ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder. I have not been able to loose weight despite diet control and exercises due to my binge eating disorder. I would maintain healthy lifestyle for 3 days and on 4th day I would binge eat. That would nullify the affects of my healthy nutrition/exercise.So started taking this hoping it will help with my binge eating disorder as contrave also works by suppressing the high you get from sugary/junk foods

**Effects on appetite** : This drug did not had any major effects in suppressing appetite during the past one week. 

**Effects on cravings** : Cravings have reduced to great extent. I did not have any binge eating episode for the past one week. I still crave for some sweets after lunch and dinner but I have not crossed 100-150 calories in my sweets in the past one week. 

As per official contrave website, the recommendation is to take one pill in week 1, two in week 2, 3 in week 3 and 4 from 4th onwards. Since contrave is bupropion/naltrexone in 90mg/8mg ratio, and the generic bupropion is available as 300 mg tablets and naltrexone as 50 mg tablets, I plan to increase double my current dosage to 300/25 from week 3 onwards.

What helps me recover when I've gained a bit too much weight.,0,sjvx0n,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sjvx0n/what_helps_me_recover_when_ive_gained_a_bit_too/,4,"For the past 6 months I've been binging almost everyday and have gained a lot of weight. However, recently I have lost quite a bit of weight by making myself binge only once a week, and restricting the rest of the time. I know this isn't the healthiest solution, but for me it's healthier than binging everyday. 

I am aware that many of you have probably already tried this, but here's the thing. There are pockets in time where you finally have enough motivation to pull through and commit to a goal. I know they say that trying the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity, but I have tried this method and failed many times before. I have also tried this method and succeeded many times before. You just have to keep trying. Those pockets in time will come. I promise.

Also, I know this suggestion is annoying for some people, but when I went vegan (not vegan anymore bc of my ed, but i swear this worked well at the time) I would binge on foods that were high carb and low fat and I was losing weight. I was technically still a binge eater, but I would eat things like ice cream made out of frozen bananas, so I lost weight and satisfied my urges to binge at the same time. Just food for thought.

I just recently made it back down to a healthy bmi, but I still struggle with BED. The only reason I want to lose weight is so that I can feel comfortable binging almost everyday again.",1643926229.0

A letter I wrote to myself to read the next time I want to binge,16,sj2c0b,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sj2c0b/a_letter_i_wrote_to_myself_to_read_the_next_time/,4,"Hey you,

So I’m a few hours post binge on 2/2. I decided I should write this letter to you for the next time you feel like binging. I’m not here to “reflect“ or any of that bullshit because honestly, I’m sick of thinking. So here it goes. All the reasons why you shouldn’t binge. 

So I don’t know why you’re here. Hungry? Parents bought new food? Random urge? Bored? Craving? “Fuck it” mindset? “I’ll deal with it later”? Nighttime munchies? Ate something “wrong”? Depressed? Well guess what? I don’t fucking care why you’re reading this. I care that you don’t lose your mind and binge. 

The first and most obvious reason is that we’re getting fat. Remember those barely-abs I used to have? Poof, they’re gone. Now we look 4-7 months pregnant all the time. Bye-bye tucked in shirts, thighs that look good in leggings, fitting in Mama’s wedding dress. Every binge matters and it’s all building up. Hello size XL clothing, not being able to wear [sister]’s clothes, jiggly fat, chipmunk cheeks when we smile, sausage fingers. That’s your fate if you keep going.

Next: you’re gonna feel like shit in all ways. Your stomach is going to feel like bursting. Your food is going to feel like it’s lifting into your throat but you know you’re incapable of throwing up. You’re going to get heartburn and your burps are going to be sour. You’re going to pass gas all the time and smell like shit. Your eyes are going to look swollen. You’re going to be unbearably thirsty. Your stomach is going to balloon out. You’re going to be repulsed by food. 

You’re going to be consumed by guilt. In the moment, you’re going to be like “I don’t care, the food is sOooOo good fuck this“ like any other fatass but you’re going to spend the next month cringing over this. You’re going to spend the rest of the day listening to depressing music and scouring the internet for  a cure, the same Reddit posts you’ve read a thousand times, everything that is never going to work if you don’t summon up a little bit of discipline. 

You’re going to neglect your schoolwork and your responsibilities which is why they’re both shit right now. Then you’ll try to fast to compensate, but you know you can’t restrict like you used to so then you’ll binge again and the cycle is going to continue. You’re gonna cry and hate yourself and then do it all over again.

Love, chill the fuck out. It’s literally just food. It’ll be here tomorrow. And if not, so fucking what?? It’s literally food lmfao get off your ass and go do something productive. Go fucking study for once. Read. Crochet. Color. Go fucking work out. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t binge. Like you already fucking ate, move on.

For the love of god I’ve tried all the lOvE yOursELf and cOmPasSiOn bullshit but you know that if you don’t get someone to give you some tough love you’re going to get soft. 
I’m not going to let you keep doing this to yourself. 

If it’s unbearable, sip some juice. Better 130 cals than 1300. 

I’m sick of your excuses and of your binges and of getting fat. I’m sick of everyone thinking you never eat but then you go eat two ice cream sandwiches, two PB sandwiches, half a loaf of bread, two cookies, three bowls of cereal, three chocolate bars, and a pastrami sandwich in secret. What kind of degeneracy is this? Your family in Syria is fucking starving and this is what you’re fucking doing to yourself. Grow the fuck up and get a life. Start eating like a normal human being. You don’t need to be pErFecT or hEaLtHy or sUgAr fReE. You just gotta eat normal fucking portions and enjoy your food instead of inhaling it and barely tasting it. 

Seriously I’m so disappointed in you. Like you are way too smart and disciplined for this shit. So go get some water, breathe, step outside, wait it out. It’s not too late to stop. Fucking say it out loud. It’s not too late to stop. I know we always keep going until we feel like we’re going to die because the day is already ruined but NO. Enough. That’s enough. We aren’t doing this anymore. It’s been months of this shit.

When was the last time you felt alive? That’s right. Never. Because you ruined your life over your stupid eating disorder. You’re never going to look perfect so the least you can do is be healthy.

 I hope you read this letter and decide not to binge. I know it fucking sucks but you got to push through. It’s not worth it. So let’s just get over this, okay? We’re done. We’re sick of this. I’m sick of this. Let’s just eat to live and not live to eat. 

I hope this letter stopped you. I hope you feel uncomfortable, but you’re going to sit with the urge, and you’re going to wake up tomorrow fucking glad you didn’t do it. Trust me I’ve been where you are, telling myself I I won’t feel guilty but you will. So just don’t do this. Read this over and over if you need to. Just. Don’t. Binge. That’s the goal. Not to “eat clean” or lose weight or any of that bullshit. Just don’t eat the whole kitchen and you’ll be golden. 

I hope you understand very well what will happen if you do it. Go ahead and do it, you from the past can’t stop you. But just think very very carefully that your actions have consequences. It’s time for you to grow the fuck up and have some fucking discipline. I’m not going to sit here and listen while you mope over something you had full control over. I hope you use this letter as many times as it takes until dismissing that urges become second nature. I believe in you. Go live life, sister ❤️

I ended up homeless, in debt, no job and dropped out of university. I knew I had to make a change, so I quit smoking, quit drugs and moved back to my hometown, and started getting my life back on track. 

Things were going ok until I developed anxiety. That’s when my binge eating started. I put on over 20kg. Had a good day? Had a bad day? Stressed? Anxious? Happy? Sad?

I don’t know what exactly is different this time around but I went from eating a whole sleeve of Oreos in one day to eating only when I’m hungry. I still get annoyed and bored and urges but I know that those are emotions, and it’s not that I need food, but a distraction from whatever is causing the unpleasant feelings.",1643771147.0
Can't stop binging or thinking of food,6,sikwjd,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sikwjd/cant_stop_binging_or_thinking_of_food/,1,"I've been struggling with BED for the past year, and it's gotten really bad this past month.

I can't even go 3 days without binging or overeating. Even on the days I don't eat thousands of calories I still constantly think about food. I'm so ashamed of myself, none of clothes even fit me anymore, my face looks so puffy and I constantly feel bloated/ really bad headaches and chest pains.

Today, after an awful day, I started down what I could feel to be a binge spiral - I started clearing out all the food in my cupboards and was fully planning on eating it all. But I got through two cookies and a handful of candy before I thought - this isn’t going to make me feel better, is it?

I know I’m still going to have eaten more than I should today with dinner still on the horizon but nowhere near what it could’ve been at it’s worst. I don’t have the physical discomfort on top of the emotional discomfort (I still feel guilty for overeating and overall shitty) and maybe that’s better or worse but this is the first time in a few months I’ve been able to control it at all.

Having Trouble With Eating Correctly,2,sini90,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sini90/having_trouble_with_eating_correctly/,1,"
Hello, I am a 16M and I have a very frustrating problem on my hands. I am not sure if this is necessarily classified as an eating disorder but this was the only place I was able to find to get help with my problem. Now my problem I would say is not as severe as most people's problems but I still think It is affecting my life in a negative way. To get the whole story ill start from the beginning. So over the summer, I realized how out of shape I was and I hated my body so I decided to change my diet and started working out and eating healthier options. I ended up losing a lot of weight just over the span of a couple of months. I was super proud of my accomplishment and felt happier with my body and life in general. 

Now the reason why I weighed so much in the first place was that I snacked A LOT. I mean it was really bad. So one of the rules I made for myself to help with my weight loss over the summer was to not eat any snacks at all. So I would only eat breakfast and dinner pretty much. That was the key thing I had to do in order to lose weight I had to remove the thing that caused my weight gain from my life. So that means I have gone snacks without having for an extremely long time. But, now that I have lost weight and I am in a good position in life I want to snack some here and there. But, my problem is I had a very drastic change when it comes to snacking. I went from snacking a lot which made me gain weight, to not snacking at all to lose weight, and now I want to start snacking again. So, my fear is every snack I eat will make me gain weight because of how it made me gain weight in the past. So when it comes to just a normal bag of chips I tell myself I am gonna eat them but end up never doing so because I feel like it will make me gain weight. Another thing is when I have snacked it was really hard for me to stop. I would just sit in the pantry on the floor just opening up containers of chips and snacks and eat them all in one sitting. So when I snacked in the past I had no control over myself when I ate food. I would just snack until there was nothing good left for me to eat. It was an addiction. So in order to stop my addiction I had to use the cold turkey method and completely cut out snacks. So now that I want to snack again I feel as if when I start snacking I will have been deprived of snacks for so long that when I start snacking I will just get back into my addiction and gain weight. 

Just for some extra information, I work out 4-5 days a week for like an hour each day I go to the gym. I mainly use muscle-building machines at the gym because now that I have lost weight I want to start putting on muscle. I break a pretty good sweat in the process when I exercise. So what can I do to help my problem should I portion stuff out should I try to not worry as much about what I am eating. Because I am looking for help as soon as I can because I have a drawer filled with snacks that I have not touched and I am worried they will expire lol. Any advice will help thank you for your time and have a good rest of your day.",1643804976.0
Binge eating awareness,2,simbt8,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/simbt8/binge_eating_awareness/,0,"I remember when I had started. I gained 5-10 kilograms in the span of a month. It was during the time of Ramadan, when I had to fast religiously.(this part is irrelevant, prior to religious fasting I had restricted also which is why I started in the first place). I remember eating so much without being aware. The only thing that made me stop was that I had unbearable pain, and couldn’t stop crying. It made me throw up too. I wasn’t aware that such a thing even existed. I only knew about anorexia and just being obsessed with skinny girls in general. I feel like if I had been more aware of binge eating disorder prior I could have gotten help rather than resorting to myself. I didn’t have the disorder, but the symptoms I had were of it, and it was on and off but it went on for a while. I’m not saying that we should compare Ed’s and rate their awareness or anything. But if binge eating disorder had more space in people’s minds on its own, so as to get rid of the stigma behind compulsively eating, people would receive help they really desperately need. Sugar has shown to have similar reactions in the brain when compared to other drugs. I wish moderation was easy for everyone as it is for some who are in recovery and doing really well.

New trigger discovered: Lack of boundaries and inability to set them leads to me bingeing.,11,si4x3s,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/si4x3s/new_trigger_discovered_lack_of_boundaries_and/,5,"I just discovered this and wanted to share in case someone here can relate and deals with the same issues. 

I’ve been learning and reading about boundaries lately (just started reading the book Set Boundaries, Find Peace). My lack of ability to set healthy boundaries leads me to being overwhelmed, stressed, and anxious about work and my relationships. Setting boundaries right now is terrifying for me because I am terrified of people’s reactions (I texted a friend setting a boundary and communicating an expectation about an hour ago, and since then I’ve been terrified of her reaction. This is a close friend but I am still terrified this is going to rupture the friendship because I’m terrified of people getting upset and I dislike discomfort). 

Anxiety, stress, discomfort, and feeling overwhelmed are all common triggers for binges for me. I am trying to practice and learn how to set healthy boundaries, but this feels like a really important realization. I don’t set boundaries, I feel overwhelmed, overworked, and overextended, and a binge is the way to comfort me. I feel unable to communicate with fellow people (and therefore I don’t get my needs met) so I turn to food. It doesn’t ask questions or fight back. It just comforts me.",1643747853.0

I am someone who has struggled with binge eating disorder for as long as I can remember. I’m 40. It’s been a source of deep shame and embarrassment. Like many of you I feel it has interfered in my life similar to drugs for others. 

For the past 10 years I have developed a night binge habit I have not been able to shake. I had become resigned to the fact I would be living with this semi secret habit for the rest of my life. 

Enter Semaglutide. I have been reading up on this peptide for years. I’m not sure why it took me so long to take the plunge. It has been nothing short of amazing. Instead of going to bed and then getting up to eat into discomfort I am just not interested in food. At first I still ate at night. But this has gradually just disappeared. It’s amazing. My body is confused 😂. I’m dropping weight. Feeling better. Sleeping better. Not snoring. Breathing better. 

Guys talk with your doc. The compound is remarkable. It’s expensive but there are ways to get it for cheap. There are also several other similar compounds that may be more affordable and have pros and cons. 

I would love to do an AMA and share what I have learned. From the pharmacokinetics, to the side effects, to the cost and strategies to get it for cheap. 

Average weight loss is over 10% body weight. I know that’s not the same as a binge but it’s just changed my relationship with food. Do you know how amazing it is to be able to have something tasty and not eat the whole bag and then more until you hate yourself?

There is hope!

P.s. in case I don’t get chance to do Ama
1)PM me with any questions 
2)it’s an escalating dose. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t see an affect right away. It takes 5 months to get to high dose. 5 months! Life improved starting at first dose but the high dose is where the night binging has ceased. 

From one binger to another, there is hope. Love you guys!",1643754905.0

*hopefully* a new leaf,5,shl5e6,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/shl5e6/hopefully_a_new_leaf/,15,"Hey guys, I’m new to Reddit but after Googling a bunch of stuff related to BED, I figured I might as well cave, download the app and ask questions here. To put it bluntly, I’ve hit a massive brick wall. I’m looking up to rock bottom.

I’ve been overweight my whole life. Nothing insane - I’m 5’7 and was around 175 in high school. I’ve always played sports so I definitely had a more athletic build. I’ve gradually gained weight over the years so by my mid 20s, I was 205. I didn’t really have a binging problem YET, but I could eat a decent amount of food in one sitting. 


In March of 2019, I got pregnant after trying for seven months. I was ecstatic, but a pregnancy complication forced me to stop working out during the pregnancy (I was an avid runner and enjoyed lifting weights). At my 12 week appointment, I found out that I had actually miscarried 1.5 weeks prior. In those three months, I gained 25lbs. Pregnancy was the first time I experienced binging. I was never satiated and because I was pregnant, the binging episodes often lead to extreme nausea and vomiting.


Two months later, I got pregnant with my now 20 month old son. Again, the same complication that plagued my first pregnancy was back - only this time, I had three ER visits and one admission. Definitely a dicier pregnancy but my son is happy and healthy which is all I ever wanted. During that pregnancy, I gained 65lbs - insane since my son was born a month early. I was able to lose 30lbs SUPER quick postpartum (placenta, water weight, actual weight of the baby), but I stalled at 265 for a while.


At 5 months postpartum, I found out I was pregnant with fraternal twins. I was frightened considering I was still quite overweight and my obstetrical history, but my pregnancy with my girls was super smooth and I carried them to term. I still had wicked binges while I was pregnant, but I was able to workout the whole pregnancy so I only gained 40lbs. 


305. The heaviest I’ve been. Again, I dropped about 30lbs right out of the gate, but can’t get past the 275 - 280 range because my binges are so frequent and out of control. To make matters worse, I was diagnosed with PCOS when my girls were a couple months old. I hate my body. I hate how it looks. I hate feeling like a prisoner in my own body. I hate feeling insatiable urges to eat all the time and then feeling guilty when I give in. The only reason why my weight isn’t going up much more is because I excessively workout even though I don’t want to just to combat the excessive caloric intake.


I hide my intake from my fiancé (which has gotten harder to do because he now works from home). He’s aware I’m struggling, but not FULLY aware of how I feel and what I’m thinking. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist since I was three months pregnant with my son, at which time I was diagnosed with Anxiety. Not on meds for it as sessions with the psychiatrist seemed to be enough.

I need to tell someone,5,shgpnm,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/shgpnm/i_need_to_tell_someone/,3,"I female 20, have been suffering from binge eating disorder for a lot of years, I don't know when it started but I don't remember a time where it really wasn't there. 

Im obese and have decided once again to lose weight, until now this is most likely the longest I have been going. Im on Ozempic which is a huge help since it is helping me remove the urge to eat and especially binge. I started in the start of December at first on Saxenda with a start weight at 278 pounds (127kg) I lost 9 pounds in 3 weeks, and then Christmas arrive in this period I lost control and was struggling so hard, I changed from saxenda to Ozempic, and had it not been for the medication I would have gained the lost weight back - luckily I didn't - I started loosing weight again a few weeks later after getting my urge to binge a bit more under control. Im currently at 262 (119kg). I started working out with my friends and im with them a lot, they know I've been losing weight and they are also aware of my BED. 

What im struggling with lately is the intense fear of losing control again, im therefore working out a lot more, and eating a lot less (I dont feel hunger, but I try to eat around 1200 max). My friends keeps pounding me too eat more, and I dont know how nor do I want to tell them about my intense fear of losing control, It only takes one mishap and I spiral back down to my old habits. 

It is so hard and im constantly crying myself to sleep. I really dont want to lose control, I finally have control for once in my life over my food intake, and I dont ever wanna go back to losing it again. It hurts when they are telling me too eat cause food is my worst fear at the moment, it is the thing that is keeping me from leaving a healthy life, without having to worry about hurtful comments about my size, possible health problems and everything that follow with being obese.",1643674396.0

I’ve really been struggling with night eating this winter. It’s been an issue on and off for years but it’s come back this winter and I decided to order myself something called a “k safe”. It’s basically a box that locks itself for a certain amount of time that you can set. I plan on putting as much food as I can in it and lock it up for the night. Last night I put it in the fridge (I actually found out it’s not recommended to keep it in the fridge/freezer as it can damage the batteries so I won’t do that again) but it kept me from waking up in the middle of the night to mindlessly eat. 
I have a lot of hope that this will help me. I don’t mean to be promoting this product but I truly think this could be a game changer. The only thing standing between me and happiness is this horrible night eating habit and the unwanted weight I have gained from it. 
If anyone else on here has experience with this product please let me know!

In recovery but partner eating my food still stresses me out - is this relatable?,35,sg2u3x,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sg2u3x/in_recovery_but_partner_eating_my_food_still/,8,"Hey all,

I struggled with BED until and after college and have in the last few years been in recovery. But there is one situation I'm dealing with lately that I'm trying to navigate that I think is related to my BED and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or has had a similar experience.

My partner often eats my food - usually after asking, but not always. And when she asks, I don't always want to say yes, but I don't want to be an ass by saying no. 

This came up tonight. I ordered some special cookies for my birthday. I hadn't had them since I was a kid because they're from my family's home country, so they were a little expensive. But it was my birthday and I wanted to feel nostalgic.

I think a real test of my recovery has been my ability to have treats at home and not eat them all at once. It's something I'm proud of. There was a time that I didn't think I could get here. 

She let me know that she ate a couple of my remaining cookies (it was a box of 12 - I'd shared some with her on my birthday but I was trying to just eat one a day since then) leaving two halves of two separate flavors. She said it was because she hadn't eaten all day and those were the only readily available things to eat in the cupboard. 

It sort of sent my system into a panic. One of the ways I've kept from binging is telling myself ""The food will be there tomorrow."" But since living with a partner, sometimes I feel the urge to eat some foods of mine quicker so that they won't be taken. I expressed that I was feeling a little upset about it, and I could tell that upset her so she went upstairs to be alone. And then I felt guilty. Like what's wrong with me? Shouldn't I want to share everything? Why don't I?

We already talked about it after that and decided on getting her some of her own cookies that are designated as hers vs mine, and also getting more readily available foods for her. So that's fine. But I'm just wondering if others here have had similar experiences and how you coped with them.",1643524068.0
Ruined it all,9,sg2qv0,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sg2qv0/ruined_it_all/,2,"New here. Not even sure if this is the place for this. Mostly just want to vent. 

Last year after Christmas I just got sick of it. Something changed… a switch flipped inside of me. I stopped binge eating after abusing food my entire life, I started exercising, I deleted all my food ordering apps, I lost over 40 lbs, it all felt easy. For about 6 months, it was easy. I thought that this was it. It was over. I woke up one morning and decided I had had enough and it was over. 

I don’t know what happened. It started with one little slip up. I had an awful week, I was home alone, I ordered food and I binged. I took a photo of the all the food wrappers so I could remember how awful I felt in that moment. I told myself never again. 

My weight loss stalled after that. I stopped exercising. I maintained… for a while. I told myself that was okay, I just needed a breather. I would find my groove again. 

Except I never did. Little cheat snacks turned into cheat meals and into cheat days and now it’s been weeks on end of ordering food and hiding it. Eating anything and everything in secret. Stuffing my face when I think no one is watching. 

I gained almost everything back in record time. Everything is tight and uncomfortable again. I’m exhausted, I don’t want to be seen, I can barely look anyone in the eye. 

Getting back to that place I was in last year seems impossible. I’ve started and failed so many times I’ve lost count. I can’t even fight the urge anymore, it’s always there, it never goes away.

Binge eating for 5 years,4,sfvgsi,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sfvgsi/binge_eating_for_5_years/,0,"(This is a repost of mine from another subreddit)

I woke up feeling terrible today. I could not sleep the night before, because I was tossing and turning for 4 hours straight. Any bed I sleep in feels to hard and my thoughts start racing. I also get flashbacks to all of the bad things that happened to me whenever I tried to sleep when I was a kid.


The next day, I felt very tired and sluggish. I went downstairs and there was a bowl piled to the top with candy bars.

My mom had got them from the food pantry the night before after specifically asking her to bring home something healthy.

Without thinking, I grabbed several m&ms, Hershey bars and snickers. I sat in a corner and ate it all as fast as I could. My stomach started hurting, but I did not stop. 

Afterwards, I felt guilt and went upstairs to my room and fell asleep. I thought to myself ""If I didn't throw out my cutting knife, this wouldn't have happened.""


After waking up at 5 p.m, I returned downstairs and grabbed another package of m&ms and another sugary candy bar. 

I felt guilt once again and went on YouTube to look for binge eating support videos. All I could find were videos that were titled ""How not to get fat after bingeing""

""How to not gain fat"" and various titles. I've struggled with weight my entire life. I cannot eat normally. I'm either on a strict diet or I'm binge eating.

This has been going on since I was 20 years old. My family does not support me on this and they act like I'm just fine.

I've lost weight and gained muscle the past year, but I cannot control what I eat.

Maybe I should just stop eating and just drink water.",1643500788.0

I have heard of taking things one day at a time or even one meal at a time, but giving myself forgiveness for what I did yesterday or even the potential to binge tomorrow really seems to be helpful.

Recovered Bulimic and binge eater looking to lose weight without disordered behaviors,1,sf69dp,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sf69dp/recovered_bulimic_and_binge_eater_looking_to_lose/,0,"  Hey y'all. I struggled with bulimia, binging and self induced vomiting for about 7 years, and in 2021 started to work on recovering. I have not had any binging or purging episodes in a while now. My first step was take purging off limits, even if I had over eaten. 

  For a few months, I continued overeating, though the binges were on a smaller scale, I would not purge at all and have put on more weight than I am comfortable with. I don't fit in a lot of my clothes, and I am unhappy with how I look and feel. I also love running, and my speed and endurance suffered from this weight gain. 

  Currently, I am at the higher end of the healthy BMI range, and would just like to get down to the lower end of the healthy range.

  I had gotten desperate many times during the height of my eating disorder, and I would try to water fast/ not eat for days, up to 12 days no food in attempts to get weight off. This would always lead to rebound binges, and subsequent purges (throwing up the binges). More recently, having worked on myself and gotten over my bulimia, I still felt desperate enough in the passed 3 months to lose weight and tried water fasting multiple times. These lead to small binges and days of overeating,  and consequently packing on more weight. I am not used to, or comfortable with myself at this weight and it is affecting my self esteem. 

  I would like to lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way so that my running can improve, and so I can fit in my clothes again. I just don't feel like myself when I look like this. 

 *Disclaimer*: By losing weight and fitting in old clothes, I don't mean fitting in my underweight/ sick clothes again, I just mean fitting in my intermediate clothes where I was slimmer, but still in the healthy bmi range. I also talked to my doctor and mental health team about doing this/ trying to lose some weight in a healthy way, and they said it shouldn't be a problem as long as disordered behaviors are not part of the plan, and I'm receiving follow ups with them during the process. 

  I can't trust my own judgment any more, because my mind immediately goes to the extreme option: do long water fasts to lose weight quickly. I'm now realizing water fasting is not sustainable, and I can't be consistently fasting from A to Z (from this higher weight to my goal). This is why I wanted some outside perspectives. 


  I'm looking for advice for how much of a calorie deficit I should aim for, that I can stick to *consistently* to lose some weight, without falling into binging, or any other disordered eating behaviors. And any other tips as far as fitness and diet goes. 

*I was about to try to embark on yet another water fast but stopped myself and came here for advice, realizing that I was about to launch myself into another cycle of binge eating and more weight gain.*

How do they do it, you ask yourself as you scroll on tiktok and instagram, seeing post after post of skinny women living normal lives. Do any of them live the same miserable double life as you? “we all get snacky sometimes,” my dad tells me. He doesn’t understand. How could he? It doesn’t make sense to eat and eat and eat even though you’re not hungry. to count down the minutes until you can eat again. to do hours of fasted cardio only to binge on every food in your line of vision. Food is my entire life. Losing weight is my entire life. Everything else falls to the back burner; relationships, success, happiness. None of it seems possible. Nobody ever cares unless you’re anorexic.",1643333083.0
what do i do when i am surrounded by food at my job?

We have a tray in the back where we put all the messed up items and things that are up for grabs (the “treat tray”). It is nearly impossible for me to not grab a little cookie or something as I walk by and I slowly probably eat everything on the tray throughout my shift. Everyday at work is like a constant, drawn out binge of baked goods and it feels helpless. on top of that, I live alone which means I don’t have anyone around me at meal times or in the middle of the night to keep me accountable. so i’ll get home from work, order a enough food to feed a family of five, eat it all, go to bed (maybe have a few midnight snacks), wake up, go to work and do it all over again.

I Think I'm Breaking Through,12,sdzwaf,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sdzwaf/i_think_im_breaking_through/,3,"I'm 5'8 and 260ish pounds. I've been sneaking and over indulging food all my life. I believe it's related to being a black girl (only child) adopted by a white depressed single mother who didn't always have energy outside of work to interact with me. 

I really started gaining weight in middle school thanks to a bad habit of raiding the corner store with my abusive best friend. I didn't really notice. I had always been the taller one, and had a bigger/more muscular body than others, but I wasn't really aware of this. I had always competitive swam/danced.

Upon hitting high-school, I was suddenly the only Black girl and was 200lbs while every girl around me was stick thin (lots of rich people with eating disorders). That's when I realized the tie between weight and worth. My mom had always been overweight, so while we indulged together (eating out a lot, eating large bags of chips in the car, etc), I don't think we had conversations about bodily health...other than her sarcastic jokes about how unlovable my mom was. 

Long story short, I started competiting with this other larger girl, working out 2 times a day, calorie counting and only eating veggies (it was easy because I was at boarding school and didn't have to prepare food). I got down to 160 or 150 and couldn't get my weight any lower. Started getting compliments about how good my body looked. But I was severely depressed, feeling like an outsider. Then in junior year, my mom unexpectedly died of cancer. That was the first time I found myself not able to move or care for myself due to depression. 

Through out college I struggled to find myself, and really only socialized with alcohol. I managed to keep my weight a 175, but I don't remember my food habits at this time. 

In the middle of my college experience, my depression became debilitating again. I started experimenting with anti depressants, that seemed to sometimes work, but always ended in an all to familiar depressive episode that lasted months. 

Years later, I was still on my mental health journey l, working at jobs where I didn't feel good enough, and relying on my roommate as one of my only friends. They were bulimic and pretty shallow. I finally tried my first antispsychotic (that was supposed to aid my antidepressant), and I gained 60 pounds in about 3 months. I stayed in my room (due to roommate problems) and just ate and ate, while sleeping and numbing/not leaving my bed. 

Fast forward to 2020, I had my first manic episode and was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I was angry because I had mentioned to therapist and doctors that I suspected my ups and downs were a bit extreme, but people like me when I was hypomanic...I had girlboss energy during those times, but it wasn't me. I felt like the psych community had failed me, I was homeless for a bit after moving across the country and lost most of my possessions and car. 

So since that time, I have really been battling the idea of having these limitations on my life, and just feeling like I have nothing left to give. My identity of wanting to pursue my MA of PhD in psych seemed impossible qnd worthless (the professionals I had dealt with missed my diagnosis and let my moods get to a damaging point), and I was back in Boston, where I had bad memories of college and isolation/rejection. For the first time in my life, I didn't have a car, and I felt like a college student because I was/am living in a house with 8 other people (its a hippie co-op living model). I also didn't have in the city. 

All this to say, 2 years after my breakdown, I think I'm having a break through. I have been feeling very masculine about existing because of my body and hair.i finally reached out to get my hair done, while getting help to cover the financial cost. But I was at the point where I was involuntarily throwing up my food and water for months, while staying in bed for pretty much 2 years straight. 

While I scheduled doctors appointments, I knew it was mostly due to a habit my body got into and stress/lack of control. I forced myself to order groceries online, and I haven't ordered in 3 days! For someone that has spent $1000 a month ordering, this was amazing! I also haven't had a binge in that time. While I track some of my calories, my goal is to stabilize with food, get rid of some of my vomiting bloat and actually find more energy to be awake. I even walked for the past couple of days and did q really light YouTube workout. *I don't like to leave the house because I feel ugly, so this was a huge step for me*

I have a long way to go, but I'm proud of just eating food in the house, with mostly protein and small snacks. What I'm doing is trying to eat the MOMENT I am thinking about food. These moments may not be hunger cues, but i think it's helping me feel less neglected and focused on food by restricting. I actually gained back 3 pounds yesterday, and will keep monitoring my weight to not let it get out of control, but I literally adopt dread sitting up anymore. I also feel powerful, knowing that little steps are actually making a difference. My goal is to maintain eating more regularly for a few months, along with movement, finding more support online (to not feel alone) and giving myself permission to be alone /not compare my social life with other people who don't deal with what we deal with on the daily. My motivation is not feeling literally sick all the time, and hopefully feeling less mad about how my body looks. I know I will lose the weight eventually. 

So if anyone is in the same place or even better, I Boston, let me know! Looking for binge eating support groups (because OA isn't doing it for me), but also looking for friends.",1643294422.0

Does Intermittent Fasting help anyone else as well?,3,sdx8j0,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sdx8j0/does_intermittent_fasting_help_anyone_else_as_well/,8,"Hey, I'm a recovering binger(if that's the term), I've been binge free for 2 months now.

I was suffering and not able to keep it in check, but nowadays,

I eat 12pm-6pm and sometimes just 2pm-6pm, so 18-20hr fasts.

I also have severe acid reflux so eating earlier helps me.

Anyway, I'm also trying to lose weight, so I eat 1500 calories per day(2000 is maintenance)

I think why it helps is, you get to eat so much food in that 4-6hr window, that it KIND OF feels like you got to eat a lot of food and that feels satisfying. Instead of spreading it out over 16hrs where its possible to binge more. But if you make a mental block that no eating before 12pm and no eating after 6pm, it kind of helps, at least for me.

Atleast for me that's the case, then I'm mentally prepared for a 20hr fast afterwards, not even an issue, I'm used to the hunger now.

"As pathetic as it is, weight loss is the main/only reason I truly care about recovering from BED.",239,scvkug,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/scvkug/as_pathetic_as_it_is_weight_loss_is_the_mainonly/,36,"A common sentiment and piece of advice I've come across is ""you need to put weight loss on hold for now and focus on just recovering from the binge eating"" and ""you can't recover from binge eating while actively trying to lose weight, you need to heal your relationship with food first"", etc.

&#x200B;

But the thing is, as pathetic as it sounds, weight loss is practically my only true motivation/reason to stop binge eating. If I'm not working on/looking forward to weight loss while recovering from binging, then I don't really feel much motivation to recover honestly :/ Food is by far my main source of happiness, the only thing I really truly look forward to, and it makes me feel much better than any other healthy coping mechanism, hobby, or activity. It saddens me to admit it, but even things like listening to my favourite songs or walking in a lovely park pale in comparison to the sheer bliss of a binge. Even though the aftermath sucks, binging on foods I love is pretty much euphoric for me. while it's happening. Eating a bunch of crappy junk food by myself is like ""me time"" and it makes me so, so happy. However, the resulting weight gain does not make me happy at all. It makes me miserable and makes me put my life on hold due to how much I dislike my appearance. This has been happening for years and the misery weight gain from binging has caused me is just awful.

&#x200B;

If not for the fact that it causes rapid weight gain, binging would honestly seem ""worth it"" to me. Even though it affects me negatively in SO many ways -- missing out on experiences, pushing away friends, mood swings, sleep is affected, the rest of my life is stagnant due to binging -- I still feel like the only reason I ACTUALLY want to stop binging is because I want to lose weight + hate how I look right now. All of the other consequences, while annoying/uncomfortable, seem like a small price to pay for the bliss that is binging. The only consequence that doesn't feel worth it is the weight gain. That's the only true reason I want to stop binge eating. If I could keep binging and never gain weight, I 100% would. Is it okay if weight loss is my main/only incentive to recover from binging, or am i just setting myself up to fail?

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**  despite the many other negative effects of BED besides rapid and unwanted weight gain, the only thing that actually makes me want to change my ways is a desire for weight loss. I've gained a fair bit of weight from binging and feel awful because of it-- it's the one thing that makes me feel like this isn't remotely worth it. is it okay if my biggest reason for wanting to stop binging is because I want to lose weight, or is that shallow/unsustainable/setting myself up for failure?",1643166130.0

However after a year of not speaking to each other, I had ask how she has been doing last little while, while she told me she is doing good with her life (video gaming and socializing with people), she did admit she is really struggling with trying to manage her eating addiction though. I can emphasize her feelings as I gained a lot of weight too in 2020 but in 2021, I lost 6 stones while focusing on myself (I was so miserable after knowing I have AGA and constantly hating myself so one day I snapped and decided to love myself again). She really wants to see us (me and my children) but I’m honestly afraid to see her again (she has no idea about the weight loss) I don’t want to trigger her nor I want  her to invalid my feelings/and the struggles with my own food addiction. She often tells me I should try being her size (or just try being her for a day) before I complain about my weight (she was 400lbs, I was 250lbs and I was still gaining weight so naturally I was extremely upset by it). It’s hard because I really understand where she is coming from so we don’t mention about our weight anymore but, I can’t avoid this forever either.

Feeling high after relapsing/bingeing/purging,3,sdaz9k,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sdaz9k/feeling_high_after_relapsingbingeingpurging/,2,"Hey everyone

So I was just reading through comments from an old reddit post (see below), and someone commented the following:

*""(...) after I get over feeling/being sick from the binge I feel so alive and ready to move. I barely sleep, I feel like I could run forever. I'm a little hungry, but it feels light and good. In the moment it's so hard to say ""ok, stop running"" or ""add a sweet potato/some quinoa to your shrimp and salad,"" but that kind of stuff is clearly what I need to do to get myself on track. Generally after 3-4 days of hyperactivity and feeling amazing I get progressively more tired over the next 1 or 2 days and I try to hold on...I think this is especially where I need to step back, eat some healthy carbs (which I restrict and then binge on), etc.""*

My question would be if anyone can relate to that feeling, or has/had a similar experience after bingeing. I could relate to this so much, and I've never seen/heard anyone talk about this and describe my personal experience so perfectly. That's exactly how it was for me every time. 

I am a runner as well, and the first few days after a binge are always my best runs. I feel like I could run forever, and I'm not doing it to compensate for the calories I've consumed or to lose weight, it's just all this extra energy I seem to have in those moments (probably all the carbs/sugar I've consumed during the binges) that make me want to keep running. Several times I would just keep running, just because it felt so good, and usually the only reason why I would stop was that the muscles in my legs literally stopped working, like my body was just so fatigued after a while, but in my head I still had this ""high""-feeling. My mood would be great, too, and I remember writing in my journal at the time that there was absolutely no logical explanation for my great mood. It felt so weird and paradoxical to me that I wasn't drowning in shame and self-hate during those times, especially because I would feel way shittier during times where I was doing much better objectively. But I would just feel great, and optimistic, and it literally felt like I was on drugs or something, because all around me things were falling apart but I still felt amazing, it made no sense. Usually this feeling would subside after a few days. Did anyone else have a similar experience?

"Shame, Being Fat, and advice",35,scucoh,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/scucoh/shame_being_fat_and_advice/,3,"(Trigger warning- binging)

I developed binge-eating quite early, probably in 5th grade because I was bullied.

I would go to the cheapest supermarket and buy as many sweets I could get and then eat them alone in my room. I have never talked about my bullying years, but I know I need to. Currently working on finding a therapist, but I am scared because there is so much to unpack and I am also not sure if all therapists take binge-eating seriously (but maybe that is an unfair assumption). 

Anyways, I was bullied daily for years or had to be prepared for someone to say something to me regarding my weight. I was chubby back then and I can not believe I was bullied this severely for my weight when I look back at photos. Now I am obese and I can not imagine stopping binging, it has become so normal to me. I do not get binge eating ""attacks"" and I do not feel bad about it directly afterward because it is still, after so many years, know it is my safe place. I can not explain it but is is a part of me- BUT I am getting better. 

I feel like the general public sees a fat person and gets so mad. Some guy once walked past me when I was 18 and shouted ""lose weight"" even though I was not fat more chubby back then. Strangers do not care about our health, otherwise, they would have the same attitude towards smokers or people who drink too much. 

There are videos watched by millions, making fun of fat people. It has ~~become so acceptable~~  been acceptable for a long time to bully fat people for ""fun"" purposes or/ and bullying, because hey! You could always excuse your behavior by saying ""well, it's unhealthy""- we can make fun of them.

This is **not** a ""who has it worse"" contest, but other mental illnesses do get acknowledged more as you can see by the way bigger people are treated. I am not on a quest to reclaim a word, this word damaged me, and someone calling someone fat still means they are making fun of them.  I am thinking about the number of uncomfortable situations where you are the only fat person in the room and someone mentions a diet, weight loss, or accidentally makes a fat joke. The only place we have in movies is the funny one who does **not** make funny jokes, no, they have to make jokes about how fat they are- always. I feel like people expect us to hide in our homes until we are thin, do not work out in a gym, do not jog in public, do not eat a salad in public ""why is this fatty eating a salad lmao"", do not eat unhealthy in public because, well you know why.  

We have to deal with so much shame, it is never really acknowledged, and we just have to deal with it until we lose weight. If you lose the weight unhealthily, meaning you´re not healthier than before but thinner, then who cares- you are thin- congrats! / sarcasm

&#x200B;

I have avoided going to the dentist because ""what will they think of a fat person with a cavity"". I have avoided going to gynecologist because ""what will they think of a fat person who looks like me"".  Please do these things. You can always RUN out of the room if someone is rude. You can always get up and say ""you are rude bye""- yes I know it sounds funny but you can. That is my ""solution"" wherever you go- you can get up and be outside in 5 seconds. You do not owe a rude person your time. 

I am trying to get healthy, for me. I try not to do this for other people ""to show people how great I look"". I am trying to do this to be healthy, physically and mentally. I am not going to do any diets, and sadly, I see many people on here who seem prone to slip into another eating disorder. 

Please, Please do not start any crazy diets. Do not watch 1200 what I eat in a day, do not take advice from TikTokters who eat a 50 calorie yogurt and some frozen berries for breakfast. Most diets are not sustainable for you. Do something you can always do- not a diet.

Even though we binge, we still need to eat food. 

I like to only buy vegetables I actually like, same for fruits.

**Snacks:** Eat vegetables first when you wanna binge- heck eat a cucumber and a banana and something else. **Meals**: Cook a nice meal you **actually** like. And remember: Do not, or try to not, feel bad about another binge. It is not a ""reset"". All the other times you did not binge are not being erased. All progress counts. Eat enough, do not ""starve"" yourself, if you are hungry eat. And again: Cook meals you **actually** like, buy vegetables/fruits you actually ***like***. I do not like eggplants or zucchinis so I am not making meals with them. ( I am not saying do not try new stuff, or give things another chance once in a while) If you do not like oatmeal- do not try to eat it. Make food you like. Please. I found out that I do not really like oatmeal, but I love baked oats -->  you blend some oats (alone in the blender, then add: ) , a ripe banana, cinnamon, some milk type you like and bake it in a small container. 

By the way, I have been really into roasted chickpeas in the oven and fruit wise: gold Kiwis, green apples, and ripe cantaloupes. You will actually crave fruits and vegetables, but only if you like them. And do not make the mistake of not eating anything healthy because today you binged or are going to binge.  (yes, some people plan to binge like I did to seek comfort). Vegetables and fruits can be eaten after a binge too :) Do not have the ""bad day"" mentality.

To round this up: Be kind to yourself, stop your hateful thinking towards yourself whenever you can. The goal should be to be healthy and not to slip into another eating disorder because then you will have just as many problems, being thin won't make you happy if you do not address the root problems or exchange one unhealthy habit with another. We can be happy, even while in recovery.

**Most importantly**\- because I am assuming no one has told you this:  I understand what you are going through; I am sorry for all the shame you carry; I am sorry for all you have been through; and I am sorry that everyone only sees a fat person and you, therefore, always feel misunderstood. We can recover from this, and we need to be kind to ourselves.",1643162558.0

What I don't understand about conventional advice for binge eaters,134,scdsdv,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/scdsdv/what_i_dont_understand_about_conventional_advice/,31,"I tend to watch youtube channels regarding strategies for binge eaters and get some typical advice. They suggest one reason we binge is because we restrict, so the answer is don't restrict, but rather have mindful portions.

So then I will say okay no labelling items as 'off limits foods'. I will go to the grocery store and buy lets say a package of cookies, a pint of ice cream, and some chips. Then once I come home I decide I will eat something, so I take the chips and place a giant handful in a bowl appropriate for the amount I am eating. Then my brain goes, nope I want more. So I eat more chips. Then I want something sweet, so I eat the ice cream and have a few cookies. Then I go back for more cookies and more ice cream. Then I say screw it and eat the rest of the chips. So I gave myself full permission to eat, and didn't restrict but I ended up binging. Mindful portions don't work if you go back for more, but once you eat that mindful portion if you say to yourself 'okay no more' then I am in restrictive mode which causes me to binge. And when I give myself no limits I go just as crazy.

Another thing I hear is that if you restrict, you will crave the foods you are restricting. But then I also hear you crave the foods you eat, hence eat healthy and you'll crave healthy. None of it makes logical sense. So what is it? Do we crave what we eat or what we don't eat? I don't get it. I can't beat this cycle.",1643117432.0

Food has always been my comfort. 
I was bulimic/anorexic from 12-25
The only reason I stopped the bulimia was because I got pregnant. I haven’t purged since. 
So 4 years, BUT I still binge. 
Not all the time, but often enough. 
I also hoard junk food. 
Food hoarding is something I started doing around age 15, when the anorexia was at its height. 
I would hoard junk, so much of it too. Id stock pile it, starve myself, and then have huge binge days once a week or so. 

I don’t starve myself anymore and I don’t purge, but I’m still obsessed with hoarding junk. 
It’s like some kind of safety blanket that I can’t let go of. 
I know a way to help me stop binging would be to stop having so much junk in the house, but whenever I go to the store I get this urge to buy it all. 
It’s partly their clever marketing, partly the security of having it “just incase” (incase what? Idk lol) and partly my sweet tooth (sugar addiction) 
I only binge on sugary foods. I’ll get a bag of chips or something and I can eat that, but 98% of the stuff I get is sugar laden. 

So my question-Is it sugar addiction or is it emotional eating? Or both? 

I’m sure it’s a mixture of a lot, but I also had a drinking problem. Started at age 13 and I’m now 2 years sober. 
Alcohol was easier to kick than sugar is (and kicking alcohol was NOT easy) 

I go back and forth from wanting to “cut out all sugar!”
To wanting to moderate. It feels very similar to the endless loop that I was in with alcohol. 
Can I have a healthy relationship with highly processed sugary foods or does it need to be taken out of my life ?
Having struggled with anorexia…I know that restricting food usually leads to me wanting it even more. 
I’m just at a loss for what to do. 
I also know that sugar is bad. And the amount that I eat is bad, bad! 
I want to be healthy. That’s why I quit alcohol. 
But a huge part of me is convinced that a life without sugar and junk on a daily basis would suck.",1643156577.0

I have been a food addict for close to 10 years. January of last year I weighed 500 pounds and I was eating thousands of calories every day (maybe about 10-13k). Eating everything and anything I could force down. Spending my entire paycheck on binges and borrowing money I couldn't pay back to get more. I struggle with mental illness and I was in a really dark place. I stepped on the scale and saw that big huge 500. I decided to try to beat this. It's been a hell of a journey. Some nights I just cried and cried all alone because I knew it I ate something I wouldn't stop. I started taking my psych meds, working on myself, and making changes. From January to about July I was solely focusing on stopping the major binges and I took it one day at a time. Then I decided to switch gears and focus on making healthy swaps, cutting calories, and just generally focusing on weight loss. Now it's a year since I started. I've lost 80 pounds and I even lowered my A1C by quite a bit.

Rn **therapy** isn't affordable for him to receive a constant treatment.

I offered to give him the **books** my therapist gave me to work on BED some months ago, I don't know if I should try again (the books are mindfulness/cues oriented and have worksheets to raise awareness and process what pushes you to binge etc.). I've already shared every tip I had and that helped me. I understand the addiction, the pain, being constantly drawn to it. But I don't know how different it is for men and if the gender difference makes my advices unuseful.

Any advice from people struggling with BED or that have a partner with BED is really appreciated. I know I can't get him out. I just want to know about **ways of supporting another/being supported** through it instead of just the individual work stuff I know.

Here's a quick background. I've been suffering from BED since I was a child. I've been obese my entire life, hovering around the 400s in adulthood. My parents coped with their lives by disconnecting from reality and their feelings, and I grew up learning the same. My BED has been getting better recently and I want to share what is working for me.

Therapy: If you had told me two years ago that I would be shilling therapy today, I would have laughed in your face and dismissed you. Not taking therapy seriously sooner is my only regret in life, but how could I have known? I am a CSA survivor and my feelings were repressed for so long that I could not process them. I could see glimpses from the event but would feel nothing. I had almost no awareness of it before I ripped it open and dived in. There it all was, the shame, the helplessness, the betrayal, and the resulting misanthropy and anger (and the belief misanthropy and anger were ""just my personality""). This had cascading affects on my life, including the start of binge eating. One final note on this: even though I feel a lot better though therapy, it has not automatically fixed every self-destructive behavior. I still need to work on them, but I've noticed it feels possible to make changes now that I've reconnected to my feelings and am releasing the ones that are stuck.

Journaling: I never liked tracking calories or my budget. It felt like extra torture. But tracking has its advantages for me by giving me awareness of just how bad it is. This, of course, makes me feel terrible when I see the truth... but is strictly necessary. I can't get to somewhere else without knowing where I am first. I've been tracking with a bullet journal as I've seen on this subreddit, marking my days with four different ratings: reasonable, overate, binged but stopped, binged. I also said every day is good even the binge days, though I want more days of the others than the binge. Yes, even ""binged but stopped"" is 100x better than ""binged"". Even ""overate"" is still a victory because I did not binge. Lastly, ""reasonable"" means I ate the amount and type of food I planned. Eating two extra slices of pizza is ""overate"" not ""binge"". If I had called it a ""binge"" than that would be an excuse to give up and eat more. My goal is to stop feeling out of control with BED, not losing weight yet.

I see some people use CBT or meditation to move their life towards less binges. I've been very successful with internal negotiation now that I can actually sense my body's needs. This negotiation means being \*both\* restrictive and permissive with my food decisions. It's a departure from the past where I was either wildly restrictive when I was fed up and desperate, or wildly permissive when I surrendered to binging and suffering. I don't want to beat myself up anymore, nor give up, nor give in. I'm not sure I can explain the exact mental process in words, but I would try if someone is interested.

Thanks for making it this far. I wish you all find peace.",1643042747.0
Weed Infused Binges?,5,sbwqmc,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sbwqmc/weed_infused_binges/,10,"So I like weed. A lot. And I’ve been doing pretty well losing weight. I lost 5 pounds. But over the weekend I spent pretty much the entirety of it high. And when I’m high I heavily binge. And over the course of 1 weed fueled weekend I binged so much that I managed to put back on all 5 of the pounds that took me over a fucking month to lose because I lack self control. 1 weekend to reverse all the progress I made. I know it seems like 5 pounds in a month isn’t that good, and I know it’s not but it’s good for ME. So I’m pretty mad at myself.

Anyways I like weed, it helps me sleep and it makes me feel good overall, I don’t really want to stop. But if these binges continue there is no way I’ll be able to make progress. I’ve sent myself back to square one. Has anyone else had this issue? If you have, did you manage to be able to continue to get high and stop the binges? Or is my only solution to stop smoking entirely?",1643059032.0
This One Concept Helped Me End My Fear Of Food For Good.,2,sc19yo,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sc19yo/this_one_concept_helped_me_end_my_fear_of_food/,0,"Do you ever feel like you're in a constant battle with yourself about food? Like you avoid being around certain foods or situations so that you don't eat too much? Or you avoid certain isles at the grocery store so you don't buy ""bad foods""? Or you're obsessing about everything you eat because you're afraid it will make you gain weight or make you sick?
.
Well, I want you to know you don't have to live like this forever ❤️‍🩹 
.
There is a way to feel totally confident around food.
.
And the answer I'm about to give you is not rocket science. But it's not easy either.
.
Most people in this situation try something along these lines:
.
They hire someone or ask family/friends to hold them more accountable or ""look over their shoulder""…
.
This makes them feel shameful and sometimes leads to eating in secret... or eventually deciding ""f it, this isn't worth it"" so the plan backfires and they eat all the foods they'd been trying to avoid 😩 
.
So they try EVEN HARDER to find the ""right foods"" that will ""work well"" for them. They begin an endless search, limiting their diet more and more…
.
They continue avoiding anything that could possibly trigger them or make the situation worse...
.
Along this path, life gets smaller and smaller.
.
And their fear of food becomes worse and worse...
.
Can you relate?
.
I was personally following this path for a WHILE…
.
(8+ years to be exact)…
.
The truth is most people don't understand that humans are actually capable of handling way more than we realize. We're actually meant to respond positively to stress. Rather than avoiding food and situations that ""trigger"" us, we can teach ourselves to be able to handle those situations better.
.
This makes life bigger and bigger.
.
And it makes us feel more confident and able to handle ourselves in any situation 🦸‍♀️ 
.
For example, think of when you are first learning to swim.
.
How did you overcome the fear of drowning?
.
Avoiding water altogether would make you feel more comfortable, but then you'd have to avoid water the rest of your life 🤔 
.
(And btw, this IS an option when it comes to swimming, but NOT when it comes to eating.)
.
On the other hand, diving headfirst into a pool when you don't know how to swim is terrifying and just makes things worse...
.
So, here's what you have to do instead:
.
You have to dip your toe in first.
.
Then your foot. Then try getting all the way in while holding onto a floaty. Step by step, you build confidence and trust.
.
Maybe someone talks you through how to swim and float and reminds you that you're safe 🤗 
.
The same thing applies to dealing with anxiety and fear around food.
.
Small, careful steps, that you can handle, with support.
.
But, what if you just CAN'T get over your fear?? No matter how irrational it may seem?
.
This is where having a proven process and system is a huge help, as well as making sure your plan is specific to YOU.
.
(In some cases, I may also suggest using visualization techniques which I won't get into here for the sake of not making too long of a post)...
.
You have to apply the right amount of stress and effort, without it being too much, and that can be different from person to person.
.
So, I can't say exactly what you need to do to take the first step.
.
But, here's a general rule:
.
I suggest taking on 1 to 2 small actions that feel very doable. For example, eating one of your trigger foods and committing to stopping at a certain amount. Or, going to a party and allowing yourself to eat cake. Do that for 1 to 2 weeks or enough times until you feel really confident with it. Until it feels not so scary. Then, try adding something else.
.
When you do this (take small, planned steps and adjust as needed), it becomes less of a fight with yourself and more of a smooth process forward.
.
You can use affirmations and supportive self-talk along the way, but most importantly you have to ACTUALLY prove your fears wrong.
.
Eventually, the scary things will become easy.
.
For example, I know someone who couldn't go to parties because she was afraid of eating too much cake. She did this, and now she eats wherever she wants with total confidence.
.
I know another person who wouldn't eat with her family because she was so afraid of what they would think. And now she eats with them regularly.
.
Personally, I was afraid of being home alone because I’d binge. Now I can enjoy other activities without worrying about a binging when I’m on my own.
.
Now, many of you might read this and think ""that won't work for me because I'm a lost cause"" or ""it sounds too simple"".
.
Here's something you should know: believing you can have what you want is a precursor to success!
.
You have to believe, or at least act as if, it IS possible for you to have confidence with food before you can have it.
.
I know that might sound harsh, but if you simply read this info and then scroll on without taking some new action and trying it out, you'll stay where you're at.
.
On the other hand, It’s a bit of trial and error, but if you keep going, you’ll get there.
.
I know this post might sound a little simple, or even harsh, but I don't want to sugarcoat or give you more ""quick fixes"".
.
Sometimes the simple answer is the best one, and it’s often the one people avoid.
.
Feel free to comment if you have any questions or thoughts.

Not clinically diagnosed because I'm too afraid to tell doctors what's going on inside my head but I have a huge problem with binge eating. I think about food 24/7. I'm usually able to distract myself with work. But once that's over and I'm alone I eat. I will binge on anything. I once ate and entire bag of baby carrots in one sitting. I thought my trigger foods were cereal and chips but I've found that it doesn't matter the food. Sometimes I'll binge on a variety of foods. I just have this voice inside me that wants more and talks me into it. Its only a little bit of chocolate its not that bad. Then it's only a few chips. Which turns into 4 cuties an apple, toast, popcorn .... Etc. I just feel like I can't turn it off. I'm currently sitting here having eaten a bowl of raisin bran thinking about donuts, brownies, and chips. I don't need them but I want them.

Lots of realizing (vent),2,sbcids,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sbcids/lots_of_realizing_vent/,0,"I've had this going through my head for a while and decided it may just be nice to dump somewhere bc I don't have many people to confide in (regardless of therapy its nice to just throw out words sometimes)

But basically in the last months I've come to realize a lotta things after being diagnosed with ocd and ocpd, and while not completely tied to my ocd (though my compulsive behavior doesn't help), it's BED. I've always had a complicated relationship food because my mom was a health freak, which made me extra paranoid about food and forced me to have a very bland diet. When she died/was dying, we kinda threw that out the window as I was 16 and all I could do for a year was order pizza. It was the first time every eating ""junk"" food and when she did die, basically all restrictions were gone. 

However my dad was still always around to comment on those poorer eating habits and I've built up a strong shame and guilt for eating ""crappy"" food... I never recognized it as binge eating until now but basically I'd crave these kinda of ""junk"" food things and due to the negativity I associated with it I would 1) find times to have it when no one was around because I didn't want someone to comment on it, and 2) would binge it so that there was no evidence in the end (literally throwing things in black garbage bags so it child be thrown outside and not recognized if my dad saw it). The drive to not have evidence of it certainly is what drives me to binge it all at once... there's a lotta shame and paranoia but also a lot of pleasure because I'm indulging in some food that just tastes really good. Forgetting any concerns about health. Before I was 16 and that started I already dealt with a lot of eating disorder problems in the form of just starving, so I thought it was good I was eating at all now. 

I just never thought it was a binge thing, I always thought it was normal to feel shame for eating bad food enough that I just didn't think much about this habit. But the horrible feelings I gave around food has made me see it is a problem, that even if I'm not starving myself, the relationship I have with food isn't good. 

My stressor and anxieties are caused by my family and we all live together..

How much time do I have before my husband gets home from work so I can binge in peace? It is so exhausting to be constantly anxious about food and how I fit it into my day.

I have tried to see a psychologist and found it very useless. Then a psychiatrist but he wouldn’t give me any medication because I wasn’t ‘depressed enough’. Anyway, the point now is that I guess I really don’t have anyone to turn to for mental issues as none worked so I have decided to focus on the physical discomfort instead, hoping it could somehow lead me out of this.

I have noticed that ever since BED I bloat dramatically after every meal no matter what I eat. I can no longer fit into my trousers since I gained weight and with the bloating it is impossible to find anyway that would fit apart from yoga pants (Regina George situation) It could be a big binge or just an apple, and poof I look like Winnie the Pooh. My stomach grows so big that my bra starts digging into me and oops, people on public transport thinks I’m pregnant. Not only that, I don’t think it’s regular stomach gas as my tummy goes almost rock hard and I rarely let out any gas at all.

Does anyone here also have the same problem and what do you do about it? I’m wondering whether it is more of a endrocrinology issue or gastro issue.

Serious Binging Problem - Any ideas?,5,sao9lv,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/sao9lv/serious_binging_problem_any_ideas/,4," have struggled with an eating disorder for years specifically binge eating. I have been going to ED therapy for 3 years, psychology sessions, I hired a personal trainer, read brain over binge. Did everything. A year ago cracked the code to stop binging: simply eating whatever I wanted while avoiding major binge foods/triggers. 

Whenever I eat whatever I want which is currently 4 snack wraps from McDonald’s and a mcflurry per day, I don’t binge and lose weight but I HAVE TO eat that daily. I am not trying to lose weight, trying to maintain and stop gaining 20 kg and losing it every few months, 

My therapist told me what I am eating is not healthy and so I tried to eat healthier (something outside of my comfort food), and went on a major binge for 6 months and gained 20 kg. Then I went back to my comfort food and lost the weight. A few months ago my trainer told me I cannot see results no matter how hard I work if I don’t stop eating McDonald’s, so I stopped eating McDonald’s and again binged nonstop for 3 months and gained 20 kg back and cannot stop myself.

I binge to replace the food I want. I can easily eat fruits and veggies or a salad or anything healthy but it has to be above my comfort food. I can’t let go of it and when I do i binge nonstop for months. I am tired of trying to eat healthy as it becomes very expensive when I go on those crazy binges and my body is tired of gaining weight and is rejecting everything. It’s been 3-4 years of binging and I’d like to eat my comfort food move on with life and stop having it as the center of my life every single day. To me, the solution is eating what I want but everyone else tells me it is bad. 

What do I do? It was far worse before Cz I was eating 8-10 large chocolates a day but now I haven’t touched a chocolate brownie or cake in a year as long as I can have my 1 mcflurry I am happy.

Throughout my childhood, i had always been the overweight kid of the class and got bullied a lot for that.

I hit my highest weight back in 2019, which was 106kg.
Since then, in a year and a half, I lost weight and got down to 71kg mainly throughout bodyweight exercises(due to lockdown- May 2020 to October 2020) and hitting the gym (September 2019 to February 2019 and November 2020 to February 2020)

Due to rising cases in my country, gyms got shut down and i went without working out for 4-5 months, mainly due to my exams also coming up.

I used to eat food just for the taste, even if I was full. Kept eating junk due to the stress.

In August 2021, I returned and gained 4 kgs and had come up to 75 kgs due to reverting back to some of my Bingeing tendencies during those few months caused by the stress of the exams.

I committed myself to working out again, and lost a kilo but gained some muscle.

Coming back to the main point, I'm moving out of my house soon for college, and I am scared that I wont get the nutritional food i get at home (indian colleges dont have kitchens, they have a mess, or food cooked in huge amounts).

I'm scared I'll pick up terrible habits like eating calorie dense sweets again and gain all this weight back.

Somehow I went from thinking eating an entire pizza and carton of ice cream every day was necessary to be happy to losing most of my interest in food.,8,s9mxff,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s9mxff/somehow_i_went_from_thinking_eating_an_entire/,2,"No joke, I literally could not imagine living life without having a pizza, a family size bag of potato chips, and a carton of ice cream every day. Food was the highlight of each day for me and the only thing I really looked forward to. If I were forced to eat 2000 calories per day and stick to a healthy diet, then life would seem like a bleak uncopeable affair. I was addicted to food and eating 3000-5000 calories on many days. Some days I would have two entire pizzas and a family size bag of potato chips to go along with it. Eventually I developed binge eating disorder because I got into rock climbing, and I wanted to be more determined to improve at rock climbing than Michael Phelps at swimming, so I forced myself to eat 1200-1800 calories per day for months, and while I lost weight and got the body I wanted, I missed the foods I used to eat and the amounts of them I used to eat, so I caved and started binging. For about a year I flip flopped between eating 6000+ calories per day and eating 1500-1800 calories per day and I was absolutely miserable. I wanted to be the most motivated and determined athlete there ever was, but I could not for the life of me stop myself from binging. I would pace around the grocery store for an hour listening to rocky balboa trying to talk to myself into going home and not buying $30 worth of junk food for dinner. Nevertheless, I would binge eat in the parking lot or quickly scurry to my room with my bag of groceries to avoid my roommates and I would usually throw anything out I didn't finish out of shame. After binging, I would beat myself up and feel extreme levels of frustration, anger, and self-loathing. No matter what I tried (e.g. vyvanse, more lenient diets, more willpower and motivation, mindfulness), nothing would work. I even made a $7500 bet on /r/sugarfree out of desperation in which I'd stick to keto and like ~2000 calories per day for two months, but on the fifth day of the bet I ate an entire box of ginger snaps. $7500 was all the money I had in my bank account at the time, so having to give that up sucked, though I did have some investments I could sell to stay afloat. Miraculously, I'm now ten months binge free and have lost most of my interest in food. I have the body I did when I was super obsessed with rock climbing and I don't watch what I eat at all or really think about food except when I happen to be hungry. This is what I did to overcome binge eating disorder:

1. To be honest, I became so depressed that I stopped rock climbing and caring about my body, so I binged every day for like two months straight, but after gaining 20+ lbs, my hunger hormones seemed to reset or return to equilibrium, and I lost interest in eating more than what my body needed to maintain its current weight. So for a few months after the the two month binge escapade, I just ate what I wanted when I wanted to, and I slowly lost ~5 of the pounds I had gained. I was worried in the beginning that I would eat 6000+ calories per day for months on end and eventually make it onto My 600-lb Life, but I really really underestimated the power of hunger hormones and how much they can change. Chemicals and hormones are powerful: think about one's fight flight or response, the overwhelming sexual urges one gets from time to time, the urge to breathe when you hold your breath, etc. 

2. After five months of having normal hunger hormones again, I decided to stop eating meat except for most seafood and I also cut out diet soda (the former was for ethical reasons and the latter was just to see what would happen). I'm not sure if cutting out meat did anything, as I didn't start eating more vegetables and fruit or anything like that, but I've read that diet soda can change the composition of your gut bacteria, and one's gut bacteria is linked to their hunger levels, so I think cutting out diet soda led my gut bacteria towards a composition that was much more easily satiated. After cutting out the things I mentioned, my appetite tanked and I could hardly eat for a month or two and lost 5+ lbs naturally.

3. For the past year, but for the past four months especially, I have processed a lot of the trauma and repressed emotions that I denied having for 24 years of my life (I'm 25 lol). This seemed to be the final item that pushed me to where I am now. Now I have the body I want and I don't watch what I eat at all. I think I used food as a substitute for love and nurturing I didn't receive as a child or growing up, and I used layers of body fat as armor to keep my body safe and warm (I was not consciously aware that this is what I was doing).

I just wanted to share what I did, because I struggled with binge eating disorder for so long and thought overcoming it was completely hopeless, and I spent a lot of time here a couple of years ago. The methods that worked for me were methods that I thought would accomplish nothing in the beginning, and yet here I am.",1642804379.0

What the f does my brain want?!? AKA talking about eating out,9,s9jcuc,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s9jcuc/what_the_f_does_my_brain_want_aka_talking_about/,0," So, scenario: I've been craving pizza from this place. I know pizza is quite the meal and I'm trying to get my best out of exercise and, due to low work, having the time at home to cook nutritious meals.  
So I denied myself that pizza, for over a month. And binge episodes kept happening. Reading some of the posts, and from therapy knowledge, I know that denying yourself something or restricting yourself from it can cause more binge behavior.

So I planned, with a friend, to go out to have this pizza this week. Bargaing with the ED brain, that we can have our whole homemade nutritious and less appetizing meals on the other days, cause meal out day is coming up. And sometimes, this knowledge of coming gratification seemed to help so I was like ""wow it works"". The last two days were very shaky, with close to bingeing overeating.

Comes the meal out day and ofc I'm not feeling like it. But I was like ""no, we planned this with someone and maybe I don't crave it cuz brain knows it's coming. If I promise myself to get myself something and then I don't honour the promise, my brain will reinforce the behaviour that we won't be able to get what we want so we should always binge for what we want immediately"". So I went, enjoyed my pizza (due to circumstances wasn't as great as usual).

Thought right, now that I had my allowance, had what I felt like having and had been craving, and it was planned, that's it, I made it and the mind and body will be satisfied, right? Wrong. Despite not being hungry yada yada, in the evening I binged to the point of unwell and severely depressed. Despite also knowing tomorrow we have people over for lunch so it's not like ""oh no tomorrow is strict dieting"", no it is other nice yummy meal.

**At this point I'm like, brain what the fuck do you want?!? If I say no to things, then I'm restricting and you binge. If I allow you free access to food, you binge it all, no end. If we responsibly plan it, mindfully eat, take our time, each meal out or ""odd/out of usual"" meal (like going to a restaurant) triggers you into more bingeing in cravings. What the hell is the fucking way?? Just say no to all and never eat anything potentially triggering ever again?**  


***Looking for some insight and perspectives if you experienced something similar.***  


In the past I came to fearing plans of eating out or avoiding it cause I knew it would trigger me into more bingeing but I don't want to keep cutting myself out of experiences

Extra info that might affect: after the pizza meal, even though I was full and sleepy, I craved for a chocolate dessert. Due to how I conditioned myself in teen years to always have sweets at the end of meals, every time I have something that looks like meal and not random eating, I feel like I need desserts. I obviously didn't get any cause money and we just had a filling meal and felt it was just a binge craving that needs to be broken in the mind-cycle.

Also a few days prior I weighed myself, cause after a week of light lifting and eating two meals a day mainly based on veggies and protein, I wanted to see my progress. And I found out I put on weight, coming close to my heaviest ever again. The thing of course affected me negatively and made me want to binge to say fuck it",1642794989.0

My job as a barista/baker gives me easy access to sweets and other food and kind of enables my disordered eating thoughts... I've started seeing a therapist, but it's slow moving, of course.

It's especially difficult in NYC right now because I don't make a lot of money, and the city is expensive, and mostly I'm just stressed out all of the time. My only friend is my roommate. I don't really feel like I have a support system here.

"""Weight watchers"" style food",8,s8p9s2,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s8p9s2/weight_watchers_style_food/,14,"Struggling with compulsive eating for quite some years now. A few months ago I changed my diet to eating the same thing every day, prioritising protein and vegetables, and limiting sweet foods to one ""cheat day"" per week and it seemed to be working- I lost a lot of weight, felt all round healthier, and didn't get cravings at all.
But for the past couple of weeks I've had really strong cravings, and it's been extremely hard to keep sweet foods from slipping into my diet. So, I decided to buy some of those reduced fat foods to have as snacks sometimes, to deal with the cravings when I got them. I reasoned with myself that that way I'd feel satisfied and at least it was better than the kind of things I'd usually end up eating instead. I should have known I wouldn't be able to keep it to that.





I ate two after lunch, then decided to have one coming home. Then another while sat on my phone, then another, because I was exhausted and drained. Before I knew it I'd eaten a whole packet, then a packet of cereal bars, then I went to open the chocolate boxes. It's not as bad as what I used to do, but a binge is a binge.





I'm upset. I've been telling ppl I beat this compulsion, that I'm proud of myself, but it may be time to accept that I haven't. It's so hard to keep discipline, especially when I'm feeling tired and lazy in the evenings. Exercising was once a joy for me, something I looked forward to every day, but for the past couple of months I've barely been trying, telling myself it's ok because I'm tired and should give myself a break. I don't know what to do.




Either way, lesson learned. No weight watchers food, anything that tastes sweet like that will probably just turn into a binge.",1642702567.0

When I started in person school last year(grade 9) I brought a protein bar to eat during lunch. 

But after realizing it was x many calories, I stopped bringing it, because I wanted to lose weight.

So I didn’t eat breakfast or lunch during the weekday, but during the  weekends I would have a meal(and possibly a snack) before dinner.

I started binging a bit. Not much. I just read that binging is: once a week for 3 plus months.

It definitely wasn’t 2 months(possibly one? Most likely less than that tho), so I feel like a faker.

So I wanted to eat intuitively.

But I don’t think really ate that intuitively. I still tried to make healthier choices, but I ate more and stopped counting calories, so maybe it was intuitively.

I’m tried to lose weight again, and I’ve been restricted until dinner. Until then, I have tea+ water.

I thought what I was doing was okay, bc I was still eating about 1800 calories(I was counting on an app)

I think about food a lot. About what to eat later if I eat a ‘bad’ food. I stopped eating food I love because it’s x many cals, and I eat the same thing almost everyday.

I think that being skinny will make me happy. I don’t want to gain weight. I don’t like my body.

I recently contracted Covid and along with that I’ve lost my taste and smell.

Unfortunately, now that I’m unable to taste anything, NOTHING is satisfying and I’m eating more and more to try and satisfy my cravings. That, coupled with being quarantined with nothing to do but lounge and eat, has left me feeling very low.

Just wondered if anyone else has dealt with this too and could offer any advice or insight.

I do see a therapist and we’ve touched briefly on my BED but I obviously have not been to her since contracting Covid and she does not offer virtual appointments.

Any tips on stopping the urge? You inspire me.,7,s7fead,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s7fead/any_tips_on_stopping_the_urge_you_inspire_me/,2,"A lot of you have given great tips and advice. Just posting this, to be reminded and also any new tips or anything with urges to binge? Lately my clothes have gotten more comfortable on me, not as tight, and binging frequency has been lessened but it’s not easy. Particularly in the beginning when doing this. Right now I’m wanting to binge so bad but had such a great dinner earlier, why do that? Anyway, any tips and also, you all really inspire me, whether struggling or overcoming, you do.

Edit : Ended up exercising for about an hour and talking with a friend. Helped divert it. My body is slightly going through some kind of withdrawal if not binging. Have been eating normally, and did have a light - late snack but not binging. It’s incredible how our bodies get used to something and then we stop, and the ramifications of that, and what happens. Everyday I’m just trying, and to all of you out there, this might sound dumb, but put music on you love, dance, move. When you look in the mirror, say you’re a body in process and no matter what, I love you. Sounds corny maybe but it works. I’m feeling so unwell from my body going hey wait, what’s going on here? Why no binge? So that’s why I had a small snack, late. As to not do “too much, too quick”. Wishing all of you healing on your journey in overcoming this eating disorder. You’re not alone and many are in hiding over this disorder, that is extremely, slowly, damaging. I’m trying to figure out a way to make lemons into lemonade, but stuck…anyway I just hope all of you out there keep trying and know that when you do binge, it’s two steps forward, one step back. Remember that. 💗",1642560304.0
Venting - I can’t stop wishing I was the thinner version of myself that I was a year ago,9,s7ebuw,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s7ebuw/venting_i_cant_stop_wishing_i_was_the_thinner/,1,"About a year ago I was the thinnest I’ve ever been. The year before that I was the heaviest. Right now I’m right in the middle of those two points, and every single day I’m bombarded with thoughts about it, wishing I was thinner. But I know it’s objectively illogical; when I was that thin it was because I had been restricting, working so much and barely eating, I pretty much only ate smaaaaall portions of tofu & veggies and nuts and told myself that was healthy. And it was after a major surgery, too. I wasn’t strong, I wasn’t healthy or okay. But I felt more beautiful than ever when I saw how thin I was, and no matter how much I deny that I still feel I was more beautiful than ever, it doesn’t work.

And now I feel like I’ve been on a months-long binge, I can’t see my cheekbones in my face anymore and I feel so badly about myself most days. And I hate that I do. I don’t feel like myself.

I moved to a huge city in August after graduating college and I think this isn’t helping me get a handle on my mental health. Most days I want to move back home with my parents but then I feel weak because I know my mom is in part why I do this to myself, and being there won’t make me any happier in the long run.

I’m in therapy but I don’t feel like it’s doing enough.

I don’t even know what I’m asking. I’m just tired of this binge-restrict pattern taking over my life. There’s so much I want to do but sometimes I feel helpless.",1642557173.0

I’ve had trouble with binge eating my entire life and am working to understand what is underlying that causes this to happen. 

I was talking with my therapist and we connected my childhood of food insecurity with how I go crazy about food now and end up in the vicious cycles of binge and restrict over and over. 

I grew up in poverty for the first seven years of my life with a mom who worked 12 hour night shifts, and a loser of a “dad” who ignored his 4 kids and played video games 24/7. The times he would cook for us it was those Knoll packets of noodles that are like $1.50 (and so goddamn good) consisting of sodium, fat, and carbs. I would eat this yummy and nutritionally unbalanced meal and then go hungry until it was meal time again. I would sneak mac n cheese into my room so I knew I had food for when I was hungry again. On top of these challenges, I have been obese my entire life, even as a child. This is 100% a factor in my relationship with food and self-worth.

Also, my mother is very open about how she “had” an eating disorder in high school but she still does. Restrict and then binge, like mother like daughter I guess!!!! Anyways, ty for reading please let me know what has helped you in your recovery and let me know if you relate!

Also, shout out to everyone who is still fat and might always be, but are still working to heal their relationship with food.

What has been working out for me lately. (Long read),41,s6pa3b,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s6pa3b/what_has_been_working_out_for_me_lately_long_read/,5,"I have been dealing with binge eating disorder in the past, specially with sweets and junk food. It had “naturally” passed. But, since few months, it came back again. I mostly keep an healthy diet and try to even binge at healthy stuff but still.

There is one thing that it is definetly my weakness: sugar. It is almost always what I binge eat on. Specially chocolate. I’m not even sure at this point if it is a sugar addiction or binge eating disorder or the mix of the both.

Lately, I have decided to make a real effort to get out of this situation. It is not perfect, I’ve had relapses, but I can feel way more in control than before.

I feel much better, i’m less bloated, i feel better about myself and my body because of these things I have been doing and I wanted to share it here to maybe encourage and help someone.

1- Journaling. This is how the change started to me. I began to write more, in general, and about the BED. I write everything I did in a day, what I have eaten and how I felt about it. Just the act of putting into words, thinking about the most accurate word for a feeling and “putting it out there” was super helpful to, at least, put in words (to myself) what was happening. I felt it was useful to kinda feel relieved from the shame about my habits but also to have more clarity and track what was happening.
With this, I started to reflect more about my actions, be more aware of triggering foods and context of the binge, vent about my reasons why i’m binging and, more importatly, hold myself accountable. Now, everytime I binge or I resist a binge, I look forward to write about it like when you have news to tell someone. And everything I write stays in my head, I feel more in control since I’m talking to myself.

So, from this, i’ve gained insights of some practical things that have been working for me:

2- Avoid trigger foods. This is pretty obvious but , with the journalling, I’ve noticed exactly which types of sugar makes me loose control over. If I go to a convenience store and buy a box of cookies, or chocolate bars, or dates with peanut butter, I know I will keep eating it nonstop. At the same time, I try not to restric myself from eating delicious sugary foods, so what I do is buying those “cooked” sugars: if i’m going to eat sugar, it will be like a patisserie, a very nice waffle from that delicious restaurant or something I cook myself. I try to keep it a large nice meal portion of it instead of going to buy something smaller that I will keep eating and that will trigger that “well since I bought this box of cookies I might as well eat the whole thing like there is no tomorrow” mood. Because it will be a special occasion, extremely fullfilling and pleasurable while slowly teaching my body and mind that I can eat nice sugar foods and not necessairly healthy things without over doing it and/or feeling guilty about it. Sometimes I feel like “oh since it is healthy or doesn’t have a lot of calories I’m authorized to eat a lot of it till i’m bloated.” So I try to keep it as a special ocasion and get something really nice to myself. Not just “any chocolate bar that will just do the job of fulfilling my sugar binge at the time.”

3- Protein. I’m not someone who usually likes to eat meat. I’ve tried going vegetarian and all of that, but, for my body it is really hard. So even if it’s not meat itself, adding a little bit of protein powder, even to sugar things (in my case i add it to yogurt when i’m eating fruits or to my oatmeal) makes a huge difference for me. Both makes me feel physically fuller while killing my wish to sugar. I’ve felt that satiaste me more and just been overall helpful.

4- tea. I figured that one of the things that helps me feel fuller the most is liquids. I feel that is harder to binge on liquids (i might be wrong, but at least for me! Let me know btw if there is someone who binges on drinks). Because it literally fills my stomach. So whenever I eat something and i’m left with that “i want more” feeling I usually try drinking tea instead to help with that feeling of being full and not wanting to over eat. Specially because tea doesn’t taste amazing let’s be honest lol

5- brushing my teeth. I completaly underestimated the importance of this this lol because after I brush my teeth, besides removing all the “taste” from sugar from my mouth and helping digestion, it helps me by making me feel “clean” if that makes sense, and also done for the day. Like I’m done eating from today so it is time to brush my teeth. Same thing in the next day when I wake up. It is like a reset on my paladar. You don’t really wanna binge with that toothpaste taste in your mouth. I usually end the day also with a cup of greentea to reiforce all of what I said with a warm cozy drink that kills boredom and tricks the impulse of preparing something to eat. Brushing my teeth has been a game changer honestly!

6-water. Another pretty obvious one. Besides helping with the bloating, it helps me feel fuller and I always drink it before eating anything, during and after. I try to always keep cups or bottles of water around my house. It is psychological, if your eyes can see it, you’re more prone to drink it just cause it is constantly there reminding you. What the eyes can’t see, the heart doesn’t feel. (Same applies to the trigger foods)

7- sleep. I’ve been having a lot of problems to sleep, and it is known that if you don’t sleep well, the hormone responsable for feeling satisfy with a meal is less produced. You don’t digest things in a good way and your body feel like it needs more energy to stay “awake”. The insmonia and waking up in the middle of the night was definetly contributing to that. So I decided to buy melatonine extra-strenght with magnesium and it has been helping a lot to sleep and, by conseqence, with the binge. 

8- going for walks. It helps me to get some fresh air, to calm the anxiety and to spend the energy. Sometimes I feel like when I binge it is like i’m discouting all my energy and anxiety on the food. So, besides moving my body, getting some natural light and air, spending sometime outside it also reliefs a bit of this “impulse’s energy”. Also, it reminds me that there is more going on than eating. 

9- spending time with friends. Similarly to the walks, it makes me feel good, laugh and just overall have a good time. A lot of my binge on sugar comes from feeling lonely and being alone, so definetly taking some time per week to go out from your house, meeting friends makes me feel better about myself, distract me from the binge and also it reminds me there is more to life than just eating. That my life is not only about eating food. I also started living a roomate and that has been making a huge difference! Having company at my house not only forces me to be more in control because of the shame but also distracts me, and gives me an “exemple” of normal eating habits always around.

10- work. This is very particular for me, probably lots of you already work, but just in general having something else to work towards and focus on helps me distract myself, feel useful to society lol, and feel accomplished. I think it is very important to feel accomplished and that you’re being useful somehow. That being a hobby, reading, exercising or simply starting your day by making or bed and/or cleaning the house, washing the dishes… never leave anything chaotic or a mess around you. Clean enviroment = clean mind.

Well that’s about it. This is my personal experience, this is not a set of rules that will work for everybody and it is what has been helpful to me. One thing tho I definetly think would help you find your own formula is to start journaling. You’ll notice patterns, reflect on things, keep track of habits, foods and you’re holding yourself accountable. This is truly where I would recommend everyone to start cause if it wasn’t for it, I would still be stuck on this cycle of binging, waking up the next day just trying to ignore/forget what I have done and just feeling disgusted and shitty about myself while also lying to myself. Putting everything in words forces you to be honest to yourself. Without fear of being judged cause afterall it is all to yourself, only. 

Thanks for reading this long ass monologue lol and I hope it can help someone over there! It is not perfect, I still have relapses for sure. But ever since the journalling in particular, I’ve started noticing só much things about the binge. How it is something that comes to me, how it behaves, it makes me realize i’m still there deep down i’m just not in control of myself at that moment. It is something separate from myself, like an entity that takes over and I allow it. I let it come and I watch it, I experience it and I learn from it. But I am not it. 

And so aren’t you! Knowledge is power and the more you understand it, the easier it becomes and less frightning. Stay strong and keep going :)",1642482221.0

For years, I’ve been silently binge eating. It doesn’t happen during the day or when I’m sitting around at night. It happens during my sleep.

I will really stop this + binging tips,26,s6bowp,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s6bowp/i_will_really_stop_this_binging_tips/,2,"I am going to start posting updates about binge eating. Idk if you are interested or not but I think it will keep me accountable. Here are a few things I will focus on:

\- **Eat and move on.** Like seriously, I feel so happy and energized when I don't binge but then when I have extra free time, especially at lunchtime, I just keep eating because I don't have anything else to do until I feel so fucking sick and bloated. So now I will eat and move on and get out of the kitchen. It may be uncomfy at first but I actually will feel better because binging makes me sad and apathetic.

\- **Life beyond food.** Eating should not be the main focus of my day, just a compliment. That's why I will start volunteering work and I'll find a remunerated job as well. I will go to class every day because I avoided going to some classes due to feeling bloated and awful. 

\- **Healthy habits.** Doing yoga and daily stretches, meditation, going to the gym, walking in nature, going to class, reading, studying, going to therapy, and of course nourishing meals, NOT binging.

\- **Not restriction or fad diets**. I know when we want to stop binging we focus on not eating triggering foods anymore, like bread, peanut butter, or whatever. But I already tried this in the past, and here I am. I want to become a normal eater, not be stuck in binge restriction forever. That means eating and prioritizing healthy foods but not restricting foods made by others, or eating out at restaurants sometimes, or high-calorie foods. As I said, my focus is on eating and moving on.

\- **Not too much social media.** I deleted Instagram a few days ago and well, it is helping to not compare myself and not watch all day other people eating food or constantly seeing recipes and food porn on my explore page.

How to cope with people commenting on your body?,12,s6fajf,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s6fajf/how_to_cope_with_people_commenting_on_your_body/,8,"Basically I have lost some weight recently; partly due to being binge free for 5 weeks (woohoo) but mainly because I had strep throat and then covid back-to-back. People have been commenting on my body and I’m finding it really uncomfortable. I have been blaming the weight loss on being sick, but I then realised that being binge free means I am probably going to loose more weight over the next few months/years. 

People comment on other people’s bodies all the time (I know they’re wrong for doing so) but I don’t want to be triggered by these comments or conversations. I actually lost it with a friend today. She that she wished she had been sick for 3 weeks to loose a few lbs, and I snapped and said that’s a really f*cked up mindset. 

No one knows about my BED, and I’m not ready to tell people yet, but I don’t want to lie and say I’m on a diet. How do you guys handle it? Because I’d love to be more resilient and know what to say.",1642454591.0

Sitting here typing while laying in a bed full of crumbs after consuming 32,000 calories in the course of 5 hours. Had 2 more doctor appointments today. A regular visit and a follow up to a previous one. I had one last Thursday as well.  My kidney disease and fatty liver have both gotten worse. And I forget exactly what my a1c was, but that was also higher. So you know....that's pretty cool, especially since I'm only 27 years old. Now I just gotta wait for a biopsy result to come back. At this point, I just hope my body shuts down completely sooner rather than later. I can't keep living like this, constantly eating to the point of struggling to breathe every single day of my life. at this point, I feel like I'm still ravenously starving if I ""only"" eat 20,000 calories a day. How insane is that??!! There's not even a real point to this post. I'm just outing how much of a shameful compulsive embarrassment I am. I'll probably choke to death on a package of cookies in one of my sleep binges one day soon...If I don't go into a diabetic coma first since I shouldn't be eating 6 family sized packages of cookies in one sitting to begin with anyways.

EDIT: thank you all for the support. 18 hours later and I've still been doing nothing but eating. I feel so incredibly full to the point I feel like I might burst or something...like, I'm almost considering going to the ER. But I know there's nothing they could do for me. But I just can't stop.

And yes, I have had professional help. It...obviously didn't work. I'm out of options now.  I've tried everything without even the slightest change.",1642404889.0
Starting Over with Abstinence Yet Again,16,s660lr,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s660lr/starting_over_with_abstinence_yet_again/,10,"For the thousandth time, I'm starting over. The crazy thing is - a couple of years ago I thought I really had my BED totally under control. I kept a detailed daily accountability log, I didn't binge once in 2.5 years, and I ended up losing 100 pounds. I even enjoyed exercise and fresh air. And then last fall I got a big cut that required stitches on my leg and my doctor said I couldn't exercise for a couple of weeks. For some reason, I started bingeing again and haven't been able to get back into my previous alignment. It's been SO puzzling and disheartening. I've gained back 30 pounds and am totally freaked out about losing all my progress. I felt so great when I was abstinent, and I feel so terrible when I'm bingeing, so why should this even be an issue? And yet it is.

So, once again, I'm starting over. I'm doing my best not to be harsh and to 'give myself a break' and I know that 'it's not a sprint but a marathon' and all those other cliched metaphors. I'm going to re-build my accountability habits and make sure that I'm being honest with myself. Sigh. Totally not excited about this, but I've done this before and I know I can do it again.

Day one,3,s6iwzx,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s6iwzx/day_one/,0,"First time posting … I realized very recently (late last week) that I’m a binge eater. I’ve been reading a lot about it and feel like I still have so much to figure out. I’m sure it stems from my adolescent years where I often skipped meals. 25+ years later I have been a victim of yo-yo diets and food restriction. I finished my last food restriction “way of life” early December and have binged since. It was easier to call the food restriction a way of life rather than a diet, because I felt shame when it was a diet and that I would gain it all back. 
But, so far today is day 1 without a binge since well before Christmas.  I’m only eating when the meal alarm goes off on my phone, well 3 meals and 2 snacks as I use my evening snack as a dessert after supper. All my food is organized the night before into my different meals. I’ve stopped measuring my food and make sure I have plenty of healthy “clean” food at my finger tips. I’m also making sure most of my meals are bite sized. (A mini charcuterie, a pre-peeled mandarin, almonds, you get the point.) this way I can work on being a bit more intuitive with each piece I take. 
I did struggle today still, firstly because ot was day 1. Secondly, because I hardly slept last night and that is definitely a trigger for me. I made my morning coffee then asked my hubby to drop a coffee off at my office so I wouldn’t run to the coffee shop across the street where I absolutely would have grabbed a sandwich, soup, and donut, at least. 
Im also back to working out today. 
I find exercise helps me because I will value the amount of work I’ve done over the food. “That box of cookies is so not worth all the sweat it will take to work it off.” It also occupies my mind and helps me keep it it off food. 
I hope that tomorrow will be day 2!",1642463842.0

WARNING: Extreme ranting 

I have been doing well for months with almost no binges. I have been exercising and getting stronger, eating and stopping when I am full. Anyway,  the holidays came around and I went back to my parents house for Christmas and since then I cannot stop bingeing.  I wasn't able to exercise while I was gone and I think that also was hard for me. Anyway, I have binged almost the entire month of January.  I am about to start my period now and my bingeing is only increasing. It's so disappointing. I know that recovery is not linear. But now I am in that fuck it mindset. Does it really matter if I stop? I feel like it is going to keep happening. I know that this isn't the mindset to have.  It might be my PMS hormones talking coupled with annoyances from this disorder.  I want to get back on the recovery train but i'm just not feeling it and I don't know how to push myself back on the train. I keep thinking about getting on medicine but because of my work certain medicines would limit the type of work that I can do within the company. I looked up some virtual OA meetings and I might attend one tomorrow. At the same time I'm like WHAT IS THE POINT!?",1642459842.0
How I developed binge eating,4,s6e305,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s6e305/how_i_developed_binge_eating/,2,"So I (19F) have been overweight (obese) my whole life. I never really liked food and didn't eat much but because of PCOS and other medical condition I was always big.

Ages 14-17 I weighed about 300 pounds I ate about 2 meals a day mostly carbs, cheese and veggies (I'm lacto vegan because I never liked meat/eggs). I gave up on anything weight related because I didn't understand why I'm not losing weight if I'm eating so little (not purposefully but just because I didn't really care about food) 

Age 18 - I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Now keep in mind I barely eat. I was mad, I thought to myself why is this happening to me? I wished I could of at least enjoyed the foods or had more food before I was diagnosed. This diagnosis lead me to eat 3 times a day vegan keto style. I started losing weight, and it got addicting (I lost about a pound a day sometimes). Overall I lost 70 pounds. I was 230 pounds, to me this was skinny, I wanted to keep on going but I ""took a break"" for my birthday. Long story short I gained it all back.

Now (19) - I cannot stop binge eating. I feel like I missed out on food from before. I have to say even when I binge eat I stay lacto vegan for the most part (I had product with eggs on 3 binge episodes which I was in shock of because I haven't had eggs in 7+ years). I am attempting to go back to restrict (for blood sugar purposes) but it only causes more binging. I do not know what to do anymore and I'm concerned for my physical health as well as my mental health.

I'm going to put in my best effort starting today to take care of my mental and physical health.",1642451620.0

I am a 27 year old woman and I live with my fiancé. The pandemic has really escalated my use of weed which I think has worsened my eating disorder. I am so depressed it feels like weed is the only thing that has been helping me cope but at the same time I am aware that it has been negatively impacting me in some areas. I have had little success going to the gym but then they got shut down again. Leaving me locked in my house and the only thing I’m allowed to do is go to work. It’s incredibly depressing. 

I feel as if I have no control. It’s hard to buy and make healthy food. So easy to just get frozen stuff. I have no skills or mechanisms to cope with my binge eating. I have no energy to do anything. 

My fiancé is a mailman and can eat whatever he wants and stays stick-thin because he’s constantly walking and has a high metabolism. He is a habitual night time eater too which doesn’t help. I try not to have unhealthy food in the house but it feels impossible. Then I still eat whatever is there at night. It’s so hard. I keep gaining weight and eat to the point of pain.

I’ve tried intermittently fasting but that made everything worse. I feel so low. I feel like a piece of garbage with no control over my life. I have no idea where to even start. 

I also have ADD that I was diagnosed with maybe 5-6 years ago. I am on medication for that as well. I have had no luck with meal tracking apps because I just forget about them. 

My life is so stressful because of work too. I eat because it’s the ONLY thing that makes me feel good but then I feel like shit.

I reached my calories for the day after dinner and my stomach and I were completely full and satisfied.

And then some hours later I got this feeling of hunger. Not the normal type of hunger but the “I want to binge” type.

I drank some water and waited a bit to see if it went away but it didn’t. I then went to only eat an apple but before I knew it I had eaten 1000 cals over my “limit”. 
1000 cal binge is nothing compared to how much I used to binge but a binge is a binge.

"I found an app that’s actually helped me with my binging (not an ad, honest thoughts!)",4,s4n2b0,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s4n2b0/i_found_an_app_thats_actually_helped_me_with_my/,5,"I just want to preface this by saying that I’ve come here to write this post completely of my own choice, with my own honest thoughts and experience - this isn’t an ad or a plug for an app, rather a recommendation if people are looking for something to help them ☺️

I’ve been using this food diary app called [Moderation](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/food-diary-weight-tracker/id1086750452) on-and-off for the past year. It’s been a tumultuous ride with my ED but over time, I’ve seen a really nice improvement.

A bit about the app:
It’s a food diary without all the unnecessary calorie counting / diet crap. All you do is log a meal (breakfast, for example) as healthy or not - you don’t write what you ate either, just whether you think it’s healthy. The interface super simple and easy to use. There are iOS widgets and Siri integration means you can log a meal without lifting a finger - no excuses. The dev also introduced “binge” as a meal type, so they can be logged too.

Personally, I keep coming back to this app because of the whole healthy/unhealthy thing and logging my binges. For me, food diaries help as it keeps me mindful. I’m pretty bad with snacks - having snacks throughout the day helps me cut down on compensatory behaviour and binging. My biggest issue, however, is self-esteem and depression as I get really upset about how others perceive me; I’m overweight, diabetic at 21 and really want to lose weight to be healthy, but when I start obsessing about being skinny and other people thinking I’m fat, it makes my ED worse. Staying happy keeps me motivated, and focusing on health over figure keeps my mind positive. This app encourages me to be honest about my ED while pushing me to think about the “healthiness” of what I eat, rather than calories, carbs, and fat. Over time, my goal has changed from wanting to “look nice” to being healthy, namely to reverse my diabetes diagnosis. It means I don’t assess myself by what I see in the mirror, so that inner critic isn’t as bad.

Also, the dev is absolutely lovely. Previously, the “binge” meal type wasn’t an option so I emailed him about adding it as a meal type - saves me having to log 10 different snacks. The only way to add more meal types was by paying for a subscription, but he implemented it instantly for free use. He recently added a weight-tracking feature which was highly requested but acknowledged that this might be harmful for people with EDs - I’ve suggested a slider option to hide this feature from the app if the user doesn’t want it visible, which he hopes to work on.

The app has a subscription service with good paid options, but the main features are all free. No ads in sight, either. I used the app for free until recently, as I wanted to support the dev.

Hope this helps you! ☺️",1642261557.0

Advice and Encouragement,5,s4de8a,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/s4de8a/advice_and_encouragement/,1,"Hello all. 

I’ve never been formally diagnosed with any type of eating disorder, but I’ve long had a very unhealthy relationship with food. Most of my adult life, I’ve told others that I “eat my feelings.” For years I’ve had a basic understanding that I use food as a coping mechanism. I know this is not necessarily uncommon, but what once seemed innocent has developed into a real problem. 

My eating has really gotten out of hand over the course of the last several years. I would say that I overeat daily and eat to the point of considerable discomfort AT LEAST once a week if not more. It feels like I can’t stop until I physically have to stop. I almost always feel hungry and even when my body isn’t physically hungry, I still want to eat. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and eat until I’m uncomfortable. I’ll eat so much at dinner or get togethers that I’ll have to lie down. I’ll lie to my wife about what I’ve eaten. I have found ways to purchase fast food and snacks without her knowledge. I’ve broken promise after promise to myself and my wife that I’ll do better. 

I feel like I have no control over my eating habits. Food rarely brings me comfort anymore and more often than not it just makes me feel discouraged, weak, and hopeless. The lack of control over what I eat makes me hate myself. I used to love eating and trying new things and I’ve got to the point that I wish I didn’t even have to eat. I’m past the point of caring about my weight or my physical appearance. 

If anyone has any kind words or encouragement, it would be much appreciated. I truly don’t feel like I have what it takes to do better. I’m feeling very discouraged tonight. Thanks for providing the opportunity for me to vent 😢 ❤️",1642226245.0

It’s been 22 days since my last binge. I recorded it on here, and I haven’t binged since. I also haven’t felt the compulsion. A lot of that is related to being removed from a very stressful situation that was pushing me towards binging as a coping mechanism. I’m not YAY CURED but I’m making good progress.

Now the bad news.  This 6 month bout of binging has left me uncomfortably heavy. It’s exacerbating my chronic pain, and I can’t take it anymore. I need to lose weight. My pain management doctor also told me that I need to lose weight. She literally said “you gained it fast, so I’ll assume you’ll be able to lose it fast”. She doesn’t know about my eating disorder. PM doctors are weird about mental illness, so I’m hesitant to tell her. 

My new dietitian takes a strong stance against purposefully losing weight (as do all of the dietitians I found when looking for ones that specialize in eating disorders). I understand why, but at the same time I feel there should be exceptions. This is a medical issue that’s affecting my quality of life. People with anorexia are force fed to gain weight if their health is at risk. How would this be any different? I’m miserable and in pain. I was never this miserable when I weighed less. 

I know how to lose weight, but I don’t know how to lose weight without counting calories. I know my dietitian will kick me out on my ass if I start counting calories. I don’t know what to do.

I'm hoping to get some help on my eating habits. I don't know if I have a binge eating disorder, but I definitely feel the compulsion to eat if I'm bored/stressed/depressed.

I try not to eat so much anymore, both out of binges (which would end up being well over 4000 calories at times) and just wanting to lose weight (binging has made me gain an unhealthy amount of weight). My problem is that I find it hard to recognize binges. At times, I’ve blacked out and came to with wrappers and packages and takeout containers surrounding me. Other times, I’ve eaten an entire bag of chips and felt sick afterwards. So my binges have always varied in amount.

Tonight was particularly hard. I couldn’t bring myself to eat all day and then I ate dinner. With only about 400 calories in me, I wanted to eat. And that’s when I get scared of binging. Just a little bit ago, within the span of 20 minutes, I ate a few spoonfuls of Halo Top ice cream, the measured serving amount of fruit yogurt, and a handful of baby tomatoes. Is this a binge?

I always denied it because I am at a healthy (borderline overweight) BMI because I exercise so much, but I have high cholesterol due to my binging. 

Anyway, I thought I would share something that helped me stop eating before bed. Last year I joined a swim club that was Monday-Friday 5:30-6:30am for $70 a month. There was no obligation to show up every morning but I do anyway because I want to make the most out of my $70. It’s a drive away too so I have to wake up at 4:30am to get there on time.

If I eat anything after 7pm the night (especially junk food or high quantity of food) before morning swim, I would feel awful & slow in the pool. My stomach would be super tight, and my times would be bad. If I overate dinner, same thing. And I hate that feeling because I wanted to make the most of my $70 a month.

Granted I will still binge during the day if I find myself home alone. BUT it’s better than binging at nighttime! So if you have an opportunity to join a fitness club or something in the early morning, do it! Your body will punish you for your night binge and you’ll eventually have to stop.

I’m an 18 yr old female in college, and binge eating is killing me. I think I’ve had binge eating tendencies before way back when I started dieting but it turned into a full-on disorder this December. I’ve always been skinny, I’m 5’8’ and when I was skinny I was 126 lbs. I didn’t allow myself to eat things I wanted and if I did I would eat less for dinner or feel guilty, and all that was fine when I was at home. I could handle it. But after college started I gained a BIT of weight, not a lot since I still exercised and kept to my diet as best as I could although I had sporadic binging episodes and I always obsessed over what and when I eat. But during finals week, I had one day after chem finals when I couldn’t figure out a calculus problem and I just snapped. I had 4500 calories, and ever since then I’ve been binging EVERY. SINGLE. DAY, from 2000-5000 calories. And I’ve gained around 15 lbs since then. And (TW!!!!!!) 





I used to self harm since I had depression, and since I started binge eating I started cutting myself again. Mostly on my stomach. I can FEEL how much fatter I’ve become and I HATE myself for it. I feel like a monster but I CANT STOP. I feel so weak and so disgusting and so out of control. I tell myself I’ll do better but I feel so hungry and empty and ugly that I eat to feel better about myself. I tried to make myself throw up but all I can do is dry heave miserably. Btw, I have pretty severe anxiety (one symptom is perfectionism i.e. I have to look a certain way, I have to have a 4.0 GPA, etc), which may be why BED is making me so upset since I used to be so skinny and now I’ve ruined myself. And nobody seems to understand that I can’t seem to stop, and I’m so afraid I won’t be able to stop, I feel like I’m doomed and I feel like maybe I should just end this. Sorry to be so negative, but I honestly don’t know where else to turn to for help, my therapist appointment is on Thursday and I already feel ashamed to talk to him about it… Do you think I have a chance at getting better?

4 years later and I’ve repeated this process about 7 times. Recently I’ve been overeating like crazy and finding it really hard to stop, I find myself in a cycle of eating when depressed but the eating is what causes me to feel depressed.

I have started eating solely at home, this way it allows me to have a time to sit down and eat not mindlessly and practice the self control/build habits.  

I also have stocked up on healthier options that are filling to reduce binging on other not so healthy things. For background, I’m vegan so I eat mostly whole foods, but my binges always are full of sugary cookies, sweets, cereals, icecreams, and more. Having the fruit to reach for instead is helping a lot because I honestly love fruits, and also don’t feel the guilt eating them and can still eat a lot of it while I learn to control my portions. I’m not obese or overweight , but the binging fills me with guilt that was causing so much internal negative dialogue it began to be unbearable.

I started vyvanse for bed November 26th. I have been a binge eater for years and got diagnosed about a year ago. I tried other meds but read vyvanse was the one that helped the most. 

November 26th I started on 30mg. It went amazingly (until it didn’t). I cannot believe the energy and focus I had and I did not think about food at all. That lasted maybe 2 weeks. I went up to 40mg on December 17th. Again it helped for a week or 2 and then it didn’t. I keep reading it’s not until 50mg that you start to feel the effect for bed. 

The last week or so my anxiety has been sky high. I am a big coffee drinker plus was taking vyvanse. I stopped the vyvanse 2 days ago but not the coffee and didn’t notice a difference in anxiety levels. Now I’m at the point where I want to take vyvanse at 50mg and stop the coffee and see how it goes. Has anyone had high anxiety while taking vyvanse? What dose worked for you? I am going to try to get in with my dr this week and will let her know everything. I have decaf coffee in the pot for tomorrow and hoping that’s just why my anxiety has been high. I need help with my binging and it seems like vyvanse (along with therapy) is the way to go. All I can say is today I binged like crazy (first time in forever).

I’m 31 years old and since I was a teenager, my relationship with food has been diabolical, I’m overweight, but not by a great amount (around 2 stone heavier than I should be). I have successfully beat my food demons before, but they always come back. 

Here is a list of some triggers / problems;

1. Takeaways. Sometimes 4 or 5 a week, huge portions, sometimes I’ll even order from 2 places and combine them, because y’know, I have to have a dessert too. 

2. Bread. With every meal, for as long as I can remember, if it’s food, I’ll have bread with it, sometimes like 5, 6, or 7 slices. 

3. Seeing friends and family. For some reason, when I’m with people, my cravings get worse and I always over indulge, I think it’s because I’m happy to be around people, so what can make that happiness even better? Food ofc. 

4. Shame. The shame is real, I cancel plans because I feel gross, I don’t live life how I’d like to, my entire thought process revolves around food, my love life has suffered because of my on and off confidence issues (I always hide that my weight and food guilt are my main problems). 

Anyway, I’m not sure what this post is, but I’ve had enough, I’ve set clear goals and targets, tomorrow is a new day and I’m going to tackle this, without doubt. I’m not going to carry on being 25% of my potential because of fudging food.

Then came today... I was asking if I could try something of my mums when I was at her house then she said in a sarcastic voice ""are you sure you really need that?"" Then she caught herself pretty soon after and tried to recover saying ""yes, of course you can have some if you want"" but by then the damage was done

I feel like things sting so much more when they come from family 

What happened when she said that in my head also worried me too, how quickly it got back into restrictive thinking... 

Bit of back story on why this worries me. Basically 10 years ago I overheard a comment from my dad about my weight which triggered my anorexia spiral, I was the exact same weight I am now, went on a shake diet (different brand but ultimately the same thing), even a lot of the same life situations are happening for me now that were back then 

I'm trying hard to stay on the path and hopefully get a good night sleep and come to my senses tomorrow about not restricting but its difficult since I already feel so insecure in my skin",1641798506.0

For example, I found some jelly pots that are about 10 calories per pot. Now you could down three multipacks of these things and have eaten just 180 cals. This and Coke Zero. 

Is BED more about the calories than the volume? It feels like I go for more calorie dense foods in a binge - is that just because they taste nice, or more to do with the dopamine from the calories?

And would combatting BED by volume eating create more problems? Or would  volume eating without the calories/dopamine buzz associated help to break the cycle?",1641761734.0

I knew mentally (not physically) I wanted to eat more than usual but told myself that I wouldn’t feel good after so I thought I had it.. until I opened the fridge and saw the pizza and wings I had left over two days ago.. 


I heated it all up “justifying” it by telling myself that I know I won’t eat it if it’s in my fridge another day (didn’t want to be wasteful and feel that guilt) and the fact I only eat the toppings and none of the breading.. 



I was able to know midway (it wasn’t a blurry daze) I was full, but I didn’t stop.. the taste was like giving me that dopamine high and the act of physically putting a delicious thing in my mouth continuously was apparently more important than knowing how I would feel after.. 


Immediately after I cleaned up, threw the containers away, lit candles to get rid of the smell, brushed my teeth, mouthwash, washed my hands in scolding hot water to get the smell and “dirtiness” of my binging off of me.. and I feel like a piece of shit that will never change.. I was able to knowingly be in the moment yet I kept going knowing I didn’t want to at the same time. 


It feels like I don’t even have a binge eating disorder, that trying to claim I do is an injustice to people who do suffer from it and can’t help it and describe that moment of haze where they aren’t even in the moment and since I sometimes am able to be in the moment, I’m just a garbage disposal for food that will never change.

And I have for at least 10+ years, but honestly remember doing similar things as a kid and teen.  So I’m all too familiar with the feeling of eating thousands of calories in a 30 minute window and feeling absolutely sick to the point of wanting to vomit (I don’t purge).  And then still eating on top of that.  I know the feeling of being sick from over eating and not being able to sleep because of it, and thinking that I’m going to eat myself into an early grave. 


So I have had my best eating week that I can ever remember.  With the exception of Monday (we had a blizzard, so the wife made cookies and comfort foods) where I had a Binge episode.

Outside of Monday I have eaten two meals a day.  One at noon and one around 5-5:30.  (I am doing an 18:6 fast).  

I am very proud of myself and felt I needed to share what seems to work for me.  

On 1/1/22 I decided to keep a good ole calendar to clearly mark my “clean” days and I marked Monday with BED.  I find that it really helps me when I see my calendar.  I want to see “CLEAN” instead of BED.  And it so far it’s working.  I am very proud that in 2022 I have only had 1 episode.  Weekends are tough but I’m trying to hang in there.

Aren’t they both stimulants that have appetite suppression as a side effect? I mean, by binges aren’t appetite driven so I don’t see how Vyvanse might work.

Over the years I’ve done diets, specifically Weight Watchers, which have worked for me but didn’t help me stop binging after a while. Ive also read diets make it worse. However, I miss having structure. Ive also noticed that most of my binges are fast food or snacks that I sneak in my house (my mom is a diabetic so we don’t usually have really carb-y snacks around).

Is there anything that you follow that has helped you not binge? Or, has incorporating certain food/beverages helped?

Knowing that a lot of these diet plans make this work makes me feel this might be an ignorant question… but even if it’s not a specific diet plan, if there’s anything that you’ve followed that has a type of structure, that could be helpful as well.

How can I help my dad? (TW),6,ry2uqj,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/ry2uqj/how_can_i_help_my_dad_tw/,1,"My dad is 56 years old and struggles with severe binge eating.. he’s struggled with this probably since before I was born, but its to the point where it’s taking a serious toll on his health and I’m so so worried about him. 

I moved in with him a year ago to help him try to start healthier habits (quit smoking, excersize, nourish his body better etc) but he’s made no progress. My mom went through the same thing with him for 15+ years and eventually ended up leaving him because he refuses to take care of himself. 

He’s clinically “overweight” as he has been since his 20’s. Now that he’s older, it’s extremely hard for him to get around and be active on his own. 

Things I’ve tried:
1. I make well rounded, nutritious meals 3 times a day for him + healthy snack alternatives (chopped fruit, veggies, homemade granola bars)
2. Keeping unhealthy snacks out of the house
3. Encouraged activities that get him to move around more (nature walks, target practice, flower picking)
4. Dragged him kicking and screaming to the doctor to get treatment for his diabetes
5.keeping the house sparkling clean so hes
 As stress free as possible

Basically the only thing I don’t do for him is wipe his ass. I’m trying so hard to help but at what point am I enabling this behaviour further?

For the most part he eats the healthy meals i make but sometimes he will leave it sitting for days until it goes bad. His binge eating usually happens late at night, he sneaks downstairs and will drink an entire gallon of milk and bring the entire bag/box of whatever food he can find up to his room. He does it more when he’s stressed. I’ve had Covid the past couple of days so I haven’t been able to clean or cook. I picked up a few bags of chicken for myself to eat since I knew I would be too sick to cook. He ate it all the first night. I’m not upset he had some, I’m upset he ate it ALL and now I’m forced to cook for myself when I can barely stand upright. He also ate 2 entire gallons of  icecream in one sitting today. He buys unhealthy food under the guise that it’s for me, but as soon as I have one bite he eats the entire thing. 

The only time I ever personally produce “unhealthy” snacks is when I bake for my neighbours. Which I can’t do anymore, because he eats it all before I can give it to them.. he’s once eaten 3 pies and an entire bag of cookies in one night that we’re supposed to go to the neighbours. 

Talking about it with him is not an option. He lies, or gets extremely defensive and doesn’t want to hear it.

I’ve tried sleeping downstairs to try to deter him from sneaking around, but he gets angry at me and makes comments like “you have your own room”

I’m not trying to air him out, but this behaviour is so extreme and I’m so tired. I feel like I live with an adult size toddler. I can’t keep doing this, and I can’t keep watching him slowly kill himself. How else can I help without continuing to enabling/triggering him?",1641544825.0

Instead of thinking how you can punish yourself from a binge, think what you can learn from it. What are your triggers? What are your goals that a binge will impact? Write down you how feel after a binge so the next time you get the urge you can physically recall why you don’t want to be in that space again. 

For anyone thats already binged this year, its a work in process. Time changing over with the commence of new years resolutions isn’t going to magically fix problems we’ve suffered with for years.

So far I had 6 binge free days in a row which I'm quite happy about (sad reflection of how much I've been bingeing) but this is also because I have no snack/junk foods and have been eating very satiating balanced meals.

Only after finishing it do I feel a clarity again and like my mind can go back to focusing on other things.

Before the new year I was living in a house by myself. The house was messy, there were unclean dishes, my walls had damp and I was sleeping on the sofa during the day. I had no friends and I never left the house. My only comfort was gambling and junk food. Every time I woke up I would look forward to ordering a takeaway to binge on. I decided for the new year I would change my habits. I decided to move in with my mother and husband. They have a nice clean apartment and a bed and I don't feel alone. I then decided I would sleep 8 hours on a night, wake up and do breathing exercises and then go for a morning walk before breakfast and then take a shower with 30 seconds of cold. Because I was sharing a flat, I found my portions were smaller and I wasn't eating any junk. My body felt really good and I have never once felt the urge to binge. I also started intermittent fasting where I will leave a gap of 8 hours between meals. This means that I don't need to focus on food or snacks during the day. My urge to eat junk and gamble are non existent and I feel so good!

My advice to anyone who is binging right now is to find out why you feel the urge to do it and try and solve the external problems the best way you can but also maintain the areas of your lifestyle that can make you depressed such as lack of exercise, bad sleeping habits and isolation.

Well eating a whole thin crust pizza is not that much for me. I must be a monster compared to you guys. I am currently overweight but my doctor says its no concern of hers. I'm skinnier than both my therapist and my doctor. They are chubby. I'm chubby too but thinner than them. 

Anyway I just feel so lost so lonely so alone when I read about your guys bad days its supposed to make me feel better but it just makes me feel more alone because you will say that you have had 1 binge in 6 days, that is literally nothing compared to me and its not fair why am I so different and bad?

I may have developed a penchant for binging over the course of my fitness journey,12,rx9vfa,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/rx9vfa/i_may_have_developed_a_penchant_for_binging_over/,2,"I didn't know where else to put this.  Over the course of last year I lost around ~60 pounds.  I started going to the gym and counting calories and I felt great about myself.  I would share progress pics all the time on social media and everybody told me about how much of an inspiration I was and it felt amazing.

Then it started.  Even though I was typically so good about avoiding calorie-dense foods, every so often I'd get that urge to binge and I'd lose control.  I'd start off eating very small amounts of food, but it wouldn't be enough and I'd go back for more.  Then more.  Then more.  And I wouldn't be able to stop.  Eventually I'd reach the point of fullness and I'd STILL want to keep going.  I felt awful, I felt gross about myself.  I was beating myself up for having eaten so much, and the worst part is I'd STILL want to keep going.  I'd flip back and forth between ""I'll just spend the next week losing any excess weight"" and ""oh god I'm gonna undo all my progress"" like a metronome.  I feel like a failure.  I feel like I'm letting down everybody who told me I was an inspiration to them, like I'm living this double life.  And yet, despite how much I hate that I do it, I just can't stop.  The food tastes so good.  I love how it feels in my stomach too much.  But I don't love the feeling of knowing how much I ate.  I don't love the feeling of gaining weight.  I've never been so acutely aware of my body image until now. 

What scares me the most is that every source I've found states that this isn't something that'll just go away.  From what I can gather, I'm stuck with it.  The other day I ate so much I threw up.  Not that I was intentionally making myself vomit, but that I literally ate so much that my body forced me to do it.  Of course it didn't feel good at all.  I never want to do that again but I always feel that urge every so often.  I've tried eating more throughout the day so that I don't get that urge at night, but it doesn't really work because I'll eat long past the point of satiety.  I've tried eating less to try and get less calories following a binge but that doesn't work either.  I don't want to give up, I don't want to stop dieting or trying to achieve my body goals.  But right now I'm feeling defeated.",1641458735.0

Ive binged my whole life but for a straight 6 years i was out of control. I got to a point where i was purposely eating to try to kill myself. I knew i couldn't do it myself so i figured if i ate terribly enough id get sick and go that way. 

Well i ended up getting better. I worked on my mental health my life improved and i achieved alot of what i wanted to achieve but i can't even be happy with the results because i still have lingering issue. 

I lost so much weight i had a lot of extra skin causing issues. I had to get an abdominoplasty for it. Which is a result of me binging. Now ive been dealing with severe gerd for years with no remedy even with weight loss, diet change, and medication. Its looking like i have a hatial hernia which is common in obese people. Not knowing this, having the abdominoplasty where they also had to fix my stomach muscles from the weight gain, has made it alot worse. 

I am in chronic pain and it seems itz going to stay that way. I look the way i want to look and im still haunted by my choices. It just goes to show it doesnt matter what you look like. Life is going to be shit without your health. 

Please stop thinking about the weight on the scale or the size of clothes you wear. Just think about your future cause if you keep thinking about size which triggers binging even if you reach that goal weight you still may not be able to enjoy life because now you have a slew of other issues you have to deal with.

Since I was sexually abused as a child, I developed an eating disorder (cycled through anorexia, bulimia, and now BED) and as a result am quite obese (but still active and mobile and able to function). I have related issues (diabetes, hypertension, heart surgery) and some other odd illnesses. I've been in therapy for the eating disorder for 40+ years now without success. I mention this to explain that it's a long-standing issue.

Anyways, all that to say that I feel I have no chance of surviving if I catch COVID, and that it seems like we're all bound to get Omicron (or another variant) sooner or later. I've taken all precautions (double-vaxxed + booster as soon as they were available, N95 masks, social distancing, only going out when necessary) but it feels so hopeless. And that makes the binge eating disorder symptoms worse, of course.

I have a roommate who also does what is expected of us in terms of safety, but has a higher risk tolerance than I do. So I can't 'become a hermit for months until this blows over.'

Now I'd go and grab the whole carton in which they are presented in the store off the shelf and carry it to the counter. Next day I'm back and annoyed when they didn't restock because I'm in a small town and this is the only store that has my brand of choice. I was even questioned if I resell them, I just laughed it off because eating 24 bars in a day is probably not recommended. 

I also eat/drink completely impractical amounts of fuit. I really question myself how the hell I can still be hungry after 2 huge watermelons, 1 kilo of bananas, like a dozen of apples and pears for ""breakfast"" which starts when I wake up and ends when it's time for lunch. When I turn it into smoothies I am shocked how much fruit that actually is but I can guzzle that down in a few minutes. I get annoyed at night when I can't run my loud ass blender to make more smoothies. I am pretty much constantly cutting up fruit and I go through entire packs of protein powder as well because I'm obsessed with these shakes. I'm either drinking one making one, all the time. 

I am already cutting back on the protein bars and powder because that stuff is pretty much a laxative at certain amounts. It gets difficult to manage. I'm very active, go on long bike rides etc. and my weight is completely fine. But my concern is my intake of sugar and artificial ingredients of these supplements. I looked up how much grams of sugar certain fruit has and I really should stop this, this much sugar can't be good long term. I also looked at articles of BCAA intake and sweeteners like sucralose and I probably shouldn't eat ~30 times of what is advised.

I hope to find someone who relates, how the hell can I just drink one or two and be done? It seems like there is no difference in craving, ever.",1641366695.0

However, I do relapse occasionally, such as last night when I went on a sugar binge. I had a terrible reaction that I never used to experience: jittery, weak, head feels swollen and lightheaded, going from chills to feeling overheated easily, and an inability to sleep last night (finally did around 7am). My insides felt like someone’s been pummeling my abdomen. 

In my earlier days, I could have brushed off a binge after having eaten two to three times as much. Luckily, my current symptoms have improved a bit after some BMs and rest, but I still feel quite weak and unwell. Any recommendations on how to get back on the mend — Pedialyte and rest?

I've put myself in horrible debt over it, ruined my credit, and ruined my relationship due to it. After spending $6,000 in barely 3 months on food and putting myself in even worse debt, my mother took my debit card away from me. I live with my ""boyfriend"" but at this point, we are just roommates. He works a lot so he is barely home, which makes it easier to binge in shame. Eventually I started pushing him away and refusing to leave the house or spend time with him when he IS actually home, because I started to value eating over being with him. I just want to be alone and unbothered so I can eat and eat. When my spending started getting really bad, a bit before my card was taken from me, I could no longer pay my half of the rent. Because guess what? I spent it all on binge food. Which made my boyfriend be forced to work more to pay for the house. That in turn also made me excited, because YAY, EVEN MORE TIME ALONE TO JUST EAT ALONE!
Anyways, in the last 2 months of not having a debit card, I started going nuts over ways to get ahold of my precious drug of choice. So I started stealing food from wherever I can. And I started stealing money from family. And if I can't get ahold of either, I just go to my mom's house while she is at work, and eat damn near her whole kitchen. Then I text her to give her a ""heads up"" that I raided her kitchen and left a wreck and ate all her food. She goes shopping to get more so she can actually eat, and I come over again to eat it all myself....and see if I can find her wallet. Rinse and repeat. At one point, we've tried locks and whatnot on cabinets and such. Didn't work. I break them. I've also become pretty good at getting locks open in general now.
It's a disgusting shame, and I just wanna fucking kill myself sometimes for letting it get this way. I'm no different than my heroin addicted sister who died of an OD. She did the same thing.....stealing, lying, sneaky tactics. 
I have a multitude of health issues that will kill me if I don't stop this. Yet I still cant. 
Even as I type this out, I am finishing up a GALLON of ice cream that I took from my mom's freezer about an hour and a half ago. I just texted her that I took it, If she wants to replace it. But of course, I'm just gonna take that one too when she buys it and eat it all in one sitting. 
I feel like the worst human being ever. Especially since I used to be so responsible, decently intelligent, and just overall a well rounded person. Now I'm a liar, a stealer, an addict, in debt, can't keep a job, and can't keep a relationship. 
I needed to get this 100% out in the open to everybody. I don't even know why.... I just..need to come clean about what I am doing.

I was living in a place I couldn’t get it prescribed, but for other mental issues I have been on at least 20 different medicines. 

I have had BED for about 7 years. I have always been obese, but the cycles of eating thousands of calories for days followed by weeks of trying to get down what I ate over one weekend— they didn’t start until I already lost most of that weight. Since then I could maintain a healthy weight for about 3 years just be restricting more than I binged. It was still very unhealthy. As of 2 months ago im almost back to my starting weight. 

But I moved to a different country that prescribes Wellbutrin, and I can say after taking it for a month, I haven’t felt a need to binge in 3 weeks, where I had the urges everyday. I barely even think about it. For the first time in my life Im not obsessing over food. 

Im not sure about how it actually is affecting my mood, but I barely have an appetite. Im still eating enough, but instead of insatiable hunger I am eating normally.

Overlooked because I am thin,10,rvog7m,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/rvog7m/overlooked_because_i_am_thin/,3,"A lot of people stereotypically associate binge eating disorder with being overweight, but this isn’t always true. I have had this disorder for about 8 years now and I don’t know how to get help. I am thin. At 5’7’’ and I weigh 125 lbs. I’m not saying I’m thin to brag, I’m just stating facts. The reason I bring up being thin is because every time I try to tell people I have binge eating disorder they laugh it off saying “I wish I could eat a bunch of junk and still look like that!” 

I think the reason I have kept weight off is because I binge on candy. Like gummies- nothing with fats or carbohydrates. I wake up in the morning and reach for the candy on my nightstand. I lay in bed and eat it literally all day. Sometimes I eat a normal meal but other times the only thing I have consumed all day is candy. When I try to restrain myself, i can’t make it until I get the impulses to eat A LOT at night before bed. Like 20 packs of fruit snacks or multiple bags of Haroibo gummies. It’s not like a little binge or treat. It’s horrible I keep eating even when I am feeling sick. I spend so much money on candy it’s not even funny. I feel so disgusting. 

It’s also really affecting my health. Mental health is not good, weird pains all over my body constantly, fatigue, headaches, GI problems too obviously.

I had lost a lot of weight, and had felt like I was on the road to recovery with my food addiction/binge eating. 

Fast forward a few months I have a very serious health issue. It keeps me pretty sedentary and my weight started to creep up. My partner is a big guy. When I met him he was “working on his health”, but I definitely noticed some unhealthy habits. Either extended CR or bouts of binge eating, or fad diets. When we were newly dating, it didn’t bother me too much. Other than a few discussions regarding food being morally neutral. I have kids and find that talk problematic. I notice some of my old ways creeping up on me. I need to be extremely mindful. I am journaling, trying to just make healthy choices, and eat intuitively again. However, my partner clearly has some binge tendencies as well. I find that when we eat together it makes me upset. While I know I can’t control him, I have to find a way to deal with this personally.  I have noticed in recent days it’s making me want to be around him less during meal times. We hope to live together at some point in the future, but I know we can’t until I figure this out. I don’t want to hurt him, because it isn’t specifically about him. He is very kind, and super open to communication. However, I know that food is a big issue for him as well. I want to talk to him, but I want to be respectful too.

This is not enough for me and I don't have anything else with lots of fat or sugar, so I cook spaghetti and fill it with olive oil.

Getting help for my BED,9,rv42ur,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/rv42ur/getting_help_for_my_bed/,1,"(TW: mention of specific weight)
Hi everyone. I’ve been suffering from eating disorders since I was 12, starting off with anorexia, then descending into BED. I started binge eating whilst in recovery from anorexia, and everyone told me it would eventually go away and that my body was just catching up on the nutrients it was starved off but it never did. I’m 14, nearly 15 now and I’m still in this horrible cycle of binge eating. I want to get help. But I’m scared. I’m scared of getting weighed, and I’m scared of talking to people about my ED face to face because it’s so embarrassing and shameful for me. But I can’t do this anymore. I feel so depressed and lethargic everyday. I’m not fat, but I’m not thin either. I went from 5’3 and 89lbs to 125lbs in just a year. I go through a constant cycle of binge eating everyday for a week, to starving myself completely for another week. Then repeat. It never ends. 

Does anybody have an idea of what would happen if I did see somebody about my BED? Would I have to be put on some sort of diet? Can I refuse to be weighed? Thanks.",1641223374.0
Feeling shame,3,rv8zrb,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/rv8zrb/feeling_shame/,1,"I'm really hoping to recover this year in my eating disorder. 2021 was really awful for me and I feel so very lost in where I am emotionally and also with my eating. I studied abroad this fall in Spain and while there my eating got bad. I started purging often, I was over exercising, and not eating enough for that amount of activity. My family noticed it and I every time I called them I was pretty much in tears. I felt very alive but also so ghostly and like I was somewhere else. My parents got very concerned and came to visit me and saw that I looked ""fine."" I came home before Christmas and promised to get blood tests (which came back normal) and have gained so much weight. Before I was about a pound short of being underweight but now I've gained a lot of it back. I know it's also the holidays, but I am just so worried. I have little motivation to exercise and haven't exercised really at all since I've been home. And my binging has gotten SO problematic. It feels like a habit and has happened about everyday. I got presecribed anti-anxiety medications which have messed up my sleep and I just feel emotionally very lost. I've always turned to food for comfort and so maybe thats why I've been binging so much. I wake up and tell myself everyday that I am not going to binge, but then I always end up doing it. This semester I am going to stay in school, but am going to do an intensive outpatient clinic with a nutritionist, group therapy, and all. Part of me is excited to go through this and have so much support because I think it will help. But the other part of me feels like I'm not at a bad enough place (which I know isn't right), but my blood work is healthy so why should I go to this place. it will feel embarrassing going to a place with other sick people when I feel like I'm healthy. And I feel shame. My biggest fear is becoming over weight. But maybe my biggest fear is just myself. The binges has been the worst part of all of this. I'm so scared of gaining weight and tired of this over taking my life. I wish I knew how to eat normally.",1641236092.0

"I didn’t listened to my ED this time and I feel so happy about that, that i needed to share it with someone",9,ruthnc,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/ruthnc/i_didnt_listened_to_my_ed_this_time_and_i_feel_so/,0,"So I have been struggling with BED since more than 10 years ago, but i didnt realized it was that until the year the pandemic started, and thats when i begin to noticed all the thoughts that led me to binge eat and also the thoughts during and after those episodes. For me they are not very clear in my head, its not like a hear full sentences, they are more abstract and they can be imperceptible if i dont think about them really consciously (I dont know if this happens to anyone and i dont know if im explaining myself xP). 

So that being said, today I had the intention to go out and buy things to eat, i bought over the top, because i told myself (like i usually used to think) “This is the last time im doing this”, which you might suspect, thats not the first time i have said that to myself in these last 10 years. So i bought pastries, a piece of cake. But i needed something salty to balance the flavor situation (A particular thing i do since i was a child) and so i bought some Nachos and a soda and i went to this coffee shop i go, obviously to sit alone and eat while watching something on my cellphone, not before buying a milkshake and a capuchino. And so that is all i was planning to eat, even tho i knew it was too much and i probably would be full before finishing all.  And so I began eating, i already had drank the soda on my way to the coffee shop, so i started with the Nachos plus the milkshake, i struggled to finished the Nachos but i kept going because “it would be a waste”, i finished those two things and i was about to start eating the pastries and the slice of cake but thats when i stopped and began to think if i really wanted that….and so even tho the thoughts about “its going to be a waste if you dont eat it”, “you already spent money on that”, “you are going to regret it if you dont eat that”, ”common, its just today”, “maybe you can save it and eat it at home, like provision when you feel sad”, “Even if you are already full you should eat them, they taste soooo good” and other ones were passing thru my mind in that moment, i decided to stop and throw away everything that was left. 

Maybe some of you think that was probably a waste of food, and practically it was, but i knew if i saved it for someone else (Wish in that moment i would have seen the guy that usually goes there to ask for money so i could had given those to him), they would have ended up in my stomach at some point between tonight and tomorrow. So i decided that, and even tho I regret eating the first things, this is something maybe very small i finally im proud of about me in this journey and this is the first time i openly recognize myself about it, and even tho admitting this it’s somewhat embarrasing for me because im used to hiding it, i wanted to share it, for the sake of patting my own shoulder and also to let people that are struggling with this ED know that you are not alone, and that you should be proud of yourself with even the smallest, tiniest achievement, because its still a big step, even if after that you might fall again, Im so proud of you! (Thats how the process of recovering works, with ups and downs, it might sound like the most cliche thing ever :P but its the truth)

I was thinking making this short but i clearly didn’t achieve that, anyways thank you for reading until this part if you did and have an awesome day/night/evening/New year/Christmas/Hannukah/Halloween/Wedding/Birthday/Baptism or whenever you read this! :D",1641185950.0

- eating food that is close to, or is your trigger food makes things harder. Best to find a complete alternative
- feeling hungry doesn’t equal deprivation
- water and/ or tea helps 
- writing down feelings about food helps
- movement will bring momentum, if your being still and feeling like shit. Doing something different will offer change

The goal is not weightloss or healthy dieting — it’s to stop abusing food.,309,rtnl82,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/rtnl82/the_goal_is_not_weightloss_or_healthy_dieting_its/,22,"Hey all! This is a friendly reminder that BED is not caused by weight gain and therefore cannot be cured through weight-loss. In addition, BED is not cured through a special diet or food choices. We have a mental disorder that takes away our autonomy over what/when/how much we eat. The focus, the recovery, all of this comes from learning how to manage the disordered thoughts, compulsions, and gain the freedom of being in charge of our food choices.

Recovery will \*most likely\* never happen over night. This isn’t “all or nothing.” We learn how to binge less often, less severely, and stop binges before or during. It happens through lots of practice, forgiveness, and understanding when/why your brain will push you to cope with food.

I have a couple tips below if one of your goals this year is to work on BED

**You do not need to go on a diet to change your diet.**

Everyone has a diet. It’s how much, how often, and what foods we choose to eat. While recovering from BED you practice being in charge of food choices. If you’d like to change your diet — you do through small and consistent changes. You can decide you’d like a salad because you want one! Maybe because it’s a healthier food choice, maybe because it looks delicious. The point is that you’re in charge of the choice. Not because of diet rules and not because of shame.

**Building boundaries with food is still helpful**

Food triggers are so difficult. If you’re in a place where anytime you put a chip in your mouth — you’re going to set off a binge— it’s perfectly reasonable to take a break from eating chips. You can choose to not eat that food for a short period until you can have a healthy relationship with it again. I’ve taken breaks from foods and let them back into my life when I felt in control over how much I wanted to eat.

**Our binges are never random, they are set off by stressors of life.**

You can learn to recognize which stressors, or emotions, or situations set off your compulsions and then prepare for them. I want to binge when I wake up late, when I get in a fight with a friend, when I’m over tired, etc. Over time, you learn that binges are coming and how to redirect or cope differently.

**There is no shame in wanting to lose weight, but it won’t effect the BED.**

I grew up with BED. I was a ‘morbidly obese’ child and I binged almost everyday for 20 years. When I lost weight, it was the most important thing in the world. However, I hit a goal weight, and I was still binging. I understand wanting to be free from fat. As fat people, we are mistreated, discriminated against, and constantly mocked. Just keep in mind, it won’t help the eating. Losing weight is most effective and maintained if you focus on recovery and add a little exercise into your routine.

Recovery is hard, it takes time, but it’s beautiful to be sober with food. My inbox is always open to chatting, venting, or little tips. Just know that everyone's recovery is different. It’s okay if the thing that worked for one person doesn’t quite fit well with you. You'll find it if you keep trying. We got this. We are strong for doing this. We are people facing a disease with little resources and understanding from the outside. ❤️‍🩹",1641057122.0

For 2022 I have made a resolution to stop doing what I always thought I “should do”, which was diet or restrict calories. This year I am focused on simply resisting my cravings. My goal by the end of the year is to become a natural/intuitive eater and only eat when I’m hungry and only eat as much as my BODY (not my mind) is hungry for. However, I really really struggle with nighttime binges and resisting a craving when it hits. Like, one of my weaknesses is pasta, and it’s almost impossible for me to resist eating it if I want it. I can’t even tell you the lengths I have gone to in order to get a food I am craving. It’s embarrassing and honestly out of control.


So that is my biggest challenge I need to face this year. If anyone has any tips or tricks that have helped them during their most INSISTENT and DIFFICULT TO RESIST craving, you know the ones. The ones where no matter what you’re doing you can’t stop thinking about that food. If you have any tips, please drop them here. I think this is something that would really help me and hopefully a lot of us! I am new to seeing my eating habits as an actual disorder and not just me being fat and lazy with no willpower.

All I really wanted was for someone to care about me, so I thought, very logically, that people would be forced to care about me if I started becoming too thin (spoiler alert, they still didn't care). I suddenly became obsessed with looking perfect, nothing was ever good enough, and I developed a fear of calories. 

After years, I became overwhelmed with the thoughts in my head, completely obsessed with thinking nothing but food: to eat or not to eat. I was exhausted. So, I made the ""decision"" to start eating what I wanted (it was less of a decision and more of a desperate attempt to prevent myself from going crazy). While it was a relief to not have to restrain myself, a new type of thought obsession had started: self hate and guilt from overeating. But suddenly, I couldn't stop; I had given myself permission to eat what I pleased. I wasn't ever actually hungry, only my brain was. I never felt real hunger because I was constantly eating.

After years of binge eating, I was gradually slowing down, but never stopping. I kept wondering, maybe it's just because I spend this many years binge eating so now my hunger is screwed up? Maybe it was I had gotten so used to eating so much that I have altered what my brain/stomach is used to? I was convinced that it was a physical/physiological issue, not a psychological issue. I was also constantly comparing myself to my past self, glamorizing how much better I looked while I was restricting. I kept thinking that I was better off making the decision not to eat, cause then I would at least have one thing going for me. And, for some strange reason, I had this intense fear of dieting, preventing me from losing weight.

Then one day, something snapped. I didn't realize it at the time, but it helped me with my eating problems. I was still living with my parents (still am, sadly), and I was tired of everything. I was tired of trying to reason with them and not having my voice heard. I was tired of having my voice not heard in the world. This whole time, I had been hiding my opinions, my intentions, my dreams, my appearance. It may seem ridiculous, but I was also too scared to wear my hair down. So I made another life-changing decision to finally have my voice heard whether they liked it or not. I started making changes in my life, finally starting to feel in-control of my future (career/school), in control of my appearance (forcing myself to wear my hair down, buying better clothes and jewellery). I finally felt in control, my voice and appearance and opinions acknowledged.... which means that I had finally addressed the root cause of why I started restricting in the first place, all those years ago. And I didn't realize it at the time, but when I made the decision to solve the root cause of the problem, my thinking about food changed for the better. I won't say how it changed, because it won't help you, I truly believe you have to address the root cause to change your thinking. 

Now, I go to work like normal and fight every day to make my own decisions and be in control. I feel a lot better about everything. I can actually now go hours without eating, without realizing it, which I couldn't do before. The past month I've even gone like 6 hrs without even thinking about food! I do believe my obsession about food is gone (for the most part. I still accidentally overeat occasionally).

TLDR: I just wanted to basically say that you should try to address the very root issue of the problem, and the food thoughts problem might just go away on its own. It WILL take years, there is NO SHORTCUT, however there is also no other way so you might as well do it. (It's very rewarding, I promise). From the time I began restricting to now/normalcy it's taken a decade, but it would've taken sooner if only I'd listened to other people's advice on working on personal issues.",1641101750.0
I can’t do this shit,12,ru0loq,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/ru0loq/i_cant_do_this_shit/,19,"I said I would go on the paleo diet (because it eliminates cravings for bad foods, not for New Year’s lol). And today and yesterday I just caved. Hard. Also the fact that covid weakened me is killing me. I can’t run for more than a few minutes, and don’t feel motivated to even try anymore. I didn’t even start the diet and I’m binging more than ever. Is paleo the answer? Of course it will be hard, but like I said, apparently the diet eliminates cravings for junk food. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so lost and miserable.",1641094766.0
BED in pregnancy. Any tips?,3,ru5sl7,BingeEatingDisorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/ru5sl7/bed_in_pregnancy_any_tips/,4,"I've had BED since my teens, however got worse in my mid 20s. I'm now 31 and pregnant for the first time. I've been trying to have a baby for so long and I am so excited, however it's really messing with my eating habits.

Since I was only 4 weeks pregnant (7+1 now) I have been struggling with nausea and the only thing that seems to curb it is eating carbs. All the advice is to eat little and often, but I am finding it so hard to eat little. The problem is I will end up binging, then dry heaving for a bit because I've gone full circle and the nausea comes back. Then 30 minutes to an hour later, I'm hungry again.

Has anyone had this experience? Being obese my pregnancy is already complicated and I don't want to hurt my baby. I'm going to try my best from now on to strictly plan my meals and snacks, sometimes being rigid can lead to a super binge but I need to hope this time will be different.",1641113984.0
