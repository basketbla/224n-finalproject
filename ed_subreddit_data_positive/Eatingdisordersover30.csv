Not ok,7,swmjow,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/swmjow/not_ok/,3,"Hi. I‚Äôve been in recovery for 13 years for drug, alcohol and eating disorder. After a hysterectomy I gained quite a bit of weight in 2015 and I just can‚Äôt lose it. But before that I excessively worked out and orthorexia. I was on top of the world thinking it was recovery. In these last 13 years, I can‚Äôt ever seem to get the obsessive thoughts about my body and food to get better. It‚Äôs a constant thought. A constant war in my head. It ruins my days. I get so upset with myself for eating ‚Äúbad‚Äù. I did eating disorder anonymous for a while, but it never helped with my inner dialogue. I hate this so much. Can you guys please share with me stuff that helps for you? I try all the affirmations. I try to always say something positive with the horrible thoughts. I try all that. It does not help the obsession or voices. I don‚Äôt care how others see me. I only care how I feel and see myself. But I can never see myself good, except when I was unhealthy or obsessively working out. I don‚Äôt know what to do, how to stop labeling every single thing I eat ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt know how to feel better inside. I keep saying all I have to do is workout insanely and I‚Äôll feel better. My metabolism was tested and it‚Äôs the slowest on chart, so I need to basically kill myself in workouts but that leaves me not doing any because I work so much and out in Florida heat.

Random update,12,svw95d,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/svw95d/random_update/,3,"Thanks for existing.

As a recap, I left the main sub, discarded my cursed FitBit, and officially deleted every account I have ever used for \*\*\*\*spo.

The only thing I do now is calculate intake calories in my head, and I still use my scale. The number has gone up slightly in the last month, and I'm amazed it doesn't bother me more. My husband (who knows nothing of my ED) made a very positive comment about my body recently, and I know it's cheezy and/or shallow, but it was really validating. (I know it's not the opinion of men that matters, it's ultimately about my own sense of self-worth, but it helped.)

I don't think I'm free, and I genuinely could use some IRL therapy. But my anxiety levels are surprisingly low about my weight gain, and that makes me really happy, and therefore a little less anxious, in this really neat feedback loop.

I really want to get rid of my scale, y'all. But it's almost feels like throwing my phone off a tall building or burning all my clothes. It's still part of me. Ew.

And I think all of you are doing really well, and I want you all to be happy.",1645228868.0

How do you talk to your kids about food?,14,svqgsz,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/svqgsz/how_do_you_talk_to_your_kids_about_food/,10,"TW, eating habits 


I‚Äôm not diagnosed but I have many ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù eating habits. I go through binge/restrict cycles and ever since I started purging I just can‚Äôt stop. It makes my binging so much worse because I justify it by ‚Äúuneating‚Äù. 

I know a lot of my habits come from childhood. I was COMPLETELY deprived of sugar or ‚Äúbad foods‚Äù, never allowed to have them. My mom was always thin without trying. She grew up poor so just doesn‚Äôt over indulge, and she‚Äôs a smoker. Even to this day if I eat something my mom disapproves of, she‚Äôs sure to say something. 

Fast forward to now‚Ä¶ I have an 11 year old daughter (no one in my family knows I struggle with food). She‚Äôs tall for her age and at a completely normal weight, and for a long time I‚Äôve worried that she‚Äôll end up where I am. I‚Äôm SO careful/oversensitive and hyper vigilant about other people making her feel bad about food or her size. When people make comments about junk food I reword it and say they‚Äôre ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù foods, and we should of course fuel our body with mostly wholesome food, but ‚Äújunk food‚Äù is okay sometimes. I really hope this is the right response. 

Yesterday she brought home a big bag of candy from a friends house and I was in binge mode. I must have opened the cabinet 20 times, taking once piece of chocolate each time and trying to tell myself no more. I said ‚Äúwe need to get rid of that chocolate‚Äù and she said no, so I said ‚Äúok then hide it please‚Äù and she says to me ‚Äúor, you could just stop eating it‚Äù. I had to laugh, because she‚Äôs totally right, and I shouldn‚Äôt need to hide junk food, but here I am üò©

So I‚Äôd like to ask, how did your childhood affect your ED? What seemingly harmless comments were made that affect your relationship with food?

Or, if you have kids, how do you treat the subject of healthy/unhealthy food to make sure they don‚Äôt end up with disordered eating habits?",1645213131.0

Lab results questions? Bitching about treatment lol.,5,sv6ecu,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/sv6ecu/lab_results_questions_bitching_about_treatment_lol/,1,"So I'm in PHP and needed blood work to admit. I got the results and my wbc is a little low, 3.3. Google tells me this can be from restricting.  My alkaline phosphatase was low but that has been low many times. My vitamin d is low but that seems nbd. But I'll be honest, the low WBC is kind of...stressing me out. I have never had that be low. I also don't believe that that is correct and if it is, that it could possibly be from restricting bc I'm not underweight. It's all so hard bc I have been eating the meal plan for like 3 days now and my hunger cues seemed to have returned today and I fucking hate it. But then again last week i was starting to stress bc I had completely stopped feeling hungry in my stomach but only knew I was hungry when I would feel physically horrible, and that had been going on for awhile. Idk. On one hand having these lab results is making me be like, you need to eat your fucking meal plan. And on the other hand I'm like...the results are wrong, or I'm sure I'm fine by now bc I've been eating for like 3 days.

I saw the nurse practitioner today for med management (total waste of time) and she was like I have no idea what that could mean, which I'll be honest like... really? I will most definitely not be letting you fucking tinker around with my psych meds. The dietician is like 25 and has already set off my Ed alarm bells, and she's the one who is supposed to be handling anything medical. Lol. I do have an outpatient dietician I trust and that I don't think has an eating disorder and I am also open to finding a PCP but that has also proved almost impossible. Idk. I am trying to not be a bitch here but I also feel like who TF are these people. Treatment is so irritating for so many reasons, but a big part of it is bc you're just trapped with whoever they assign you to. My insurance is still covering me seeing my regular therapist outside of programming which I'm just so thankful for bc one week of programming feels like 100 weeks of real life emotions and yet also you lose months and months of your real life so quickly.",1645151082.0

I really want to post the exact amount in figure of what ive put on since i started recovery because i need reinsurance its not too much. I know im not allowed to post numbers on here though. The scales are going up and im terrified. Ive been in recovery about 7 or 8 weeks now. I dont know what should be good usual amount might be  but i guess no one here can tell me because no numbers are allowed to be used. 

Im at a point on the scales i dont feel comfortable and i feel like i could stop and turn back into a relapse and go back to restriction if i can just stop and control my extreme mental and pyhiscal hunger. Ive been listening to the hunger signals but maybe i shouldnt. I realistically still have alot to gain to where other people want my gain goal  weight to be but id stop now if i could. Im freaked out. I feel like im about to step backwards. I had reduced my exercise compulsion recently but then i stepped on the scales today then the amount exercise i did today shot up again in panic seeing that number on the scales. 

If i could go back to balancing between my lowest weight and what i am now and sit in the middle and stay there id be happy but no one around me would be because its still too low. What i am now is still realistically too low but to me its too much. And agh. What do i do?

I've been doing better slowly, but one thing that is insanely triggering for me is the feeling of being full.

Im eating alot more then i was when heavily restricting and i initially put on a tiny bit of weight  but exercise compulsion is stopping me putting on anymore recently and have been maintaining last few weeks. Ive been saying im annoyed at this... But am i? Or am i secretly glad? Im not sure. Maybe that bit of both you know the healthy me who wants be healthy but that devil eating disorder that sits on one shoulder who wants drag me down too?

Anyway the set back i may off just taken is just buying a fitbit. Thinking and justifying  its for health reasons,... No its for my dam exercise compulsions to make sure its measured bit better then how i was. I mean the fitbit has other good functions on it then just what i want it for is how i justified it. But i know in back my mind its A huge step back and will just make things worse. 

Im supposed be reducing my exercise not increasing it or getting more fixated. 

What have i done? How do i fix this? It cost a reasonable amount money,i want to keep it. 

I need just be sensible right....",1644237054.0

Lately I've been feeling like I recovered ""too easily"" - even though I know that it is factually untrue and I'm actually not ""fully recovered"" (whatever that means). I tell myself that if I was really ""that bad"" I would have been cycling in and out of treatment. Which, in reality, I did. I went to IOP, then IOP again (even though PHP had been recommended at that time), then PHP and stepped down all the way to outpatient. I'm no longer seeing an ED specialist or RD but I am working with a shrink that I've had for a long time doing trauma work and EMDR. 

I've had my ED for more than half of my life at this point, and still use ""major symptoms"" like purging maybe 1x a week but find myself using low-grade symptoms a lot like rules around meals, certain foods I won't eat, etc. daily.

This attitude is like ""oh my arm wasn't actually broken because it healed"" which is...dumb.

Initially i put on a small amount weight, nothing too scary in my mind. Extreme hunger continued and i continued eating little and often but then im hitting brick wall now my weight isnt going up at all and just maintaining.

I do exercise compulsively daily, i have just reduced the amount exercise i do too. but i still believe i should be putting on weight despite the daily exercise i do. I really am snacking alot my input is alot greater im sure.

First post ever, forgive me.

I (30,f) have been struggling with an eating disorder for months, on my own. Mostly restricting now, but during the pandemic last year I found I was binging/purging. Now the idea of food just makes me feel disgusting, my brain tells me food makes you fat (I gained a lot of weight during the pandemic, which triggered my current predicament), and if I feel like I've eaten too much during the day, I purge. Most days that is just one meal a day (that I eat with my family, as I am also hiding this from 4 young children), and wait til they're asleep before I make myself sick.

This is not my first experience with an ED but it is the first time in my adult life, since becoming a parent.

Now, at the moment, it has started becoming obvious to friends, family and workmates that I am not well. I have lost a lot of weight very quickly now I am active in my new full time job too.
But I am also loving my new body. I feel good, and confident, but always feel like I've cheated myself to get to this.
I recently came clean to my husband and he, the beautiful soul that he is, has been so supportive.
My thing right now is; how do I feel confident when I know the road to recovery is going to make me gain weight again?
I have started considering other options, like going to the gym to maintain the weight now that I've made it this far (and I know that is the wrong attitude to have, but that's where I'm at), and even as extreme as saving money for a tummy tuck/liposuction.
I know this is an unhealthy mindset to have on the road to recovery, but I need to get better. It's affecting my mental health as well as my physical health.

Long sorry.",5,sh4ojk,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/sh4ojk/not_sure_what_to_do_re_treatment_my_life_long/,8,"So I'm 33. My son is almost 4 and is the most important thing in my life. I went to treatment in 2020, did the whole gamut, PHP, res, PHP, iop, PHP, iop then outpatient. It was really hard but I did have some reduction in behaviors and I actually think I might have been ""okay"" for awhile. I didn't have a scale, I wasn't intermittent fasting. I was working out a ton still. 

About a year ago, I started intermittent fasting again. At the time I had a regular therapist and psychiatrist. I started going back to me Ed support group. I got a dietician. My relapse in 2019 was mostly bc of trauma from my first pregnancy i had before my son and deliberately sabotaging myself to not do another IVF cycle to try to have another baby. Basically the whole goal of treatment was to get myself normal enough to drag myself through an IVF cycle and pregnancy without having a nervous breakdown. So I finally pull the plug, do a mock cycle (so all the hormones) and then the frozen transfer and I get pregnant in May. Then I had a miscarriage in June. Then I found out in July that actually the embryo we paid to have tested and stored for years actually was abnormal, which is why I had the miscarriage. 

I added in an Ed therapist. At some point in the spring I was a little hypomanic again and bought a scale, obviously bad. I managed to kind of patch myself together enough to do a full IVF stim cycle in December, and we ended up with one healthy embryo which is frozen. Obviously gearing up for both the frozen transfer and stim cycle I had a massive increase in behaviors to try to get my weight down knowing I'd blow up on the meds and from just being physically unable to restrict or workout the way I want. 

December and January have been a fucking nightmare mood wise, which I blame a lot on the hormones. My weight has been up and down. I added in another Ed support group. I have a lot of unresolved issues from an early childhood trauma that keep basically sending me into a total tailspin. The dietician and the Ed therapist have mentioned higher levels of care several times and I've always just absolutely scrambled to avoid it, but about two weeks ago I was just like fine. Fuck it. I'm worn out. I am maxed out on outpatient groups and sessions. I also started self harming again in January, which is not good. 

But then as soon as I admitted defeat, within 24 hours I was like absolutely fucking not. My mood is actually a little better. I called center for discovery, where I did iop, and they recommended PHP but they aren't in person and I am not doing anything virtual bc that's a waste of time and money. I have my assessment with erc this week and I am sure they'll say PHP too. 

My main things holding back are my son and my weight. Being apart from my son in res, and just being unable to see him as much in PHP was a nightmare. I didn't see my then 2 year old for a month in res, even when they'd drop things off and I would know he was literally in the building. I felt like my heart was literally breaking being apart from him. Now he's in preschool and I just don't even know how we'd swing this since I'm the one who gets him ready for school, brings him, picks him up, and takes care of him afterwards until my husband comes home at dinner time. I do work full time but I am mostly remote. Also, I have a job interview on Friday and am waiting to hear back from another job. My career has gotten derailed several times bc of my Ed and I am just literally not sure what to do. I also don't know how I can manage to work in an office full time again though, not being able to work out when I want and weigh myself all day and eat my foods alone at my times sounds literally impossible right now. But I also am like hm commuting I might burn more calories. Although not fitting in my workouts is just not acceptable and I know I will just wear myself out staying up so late to work out. And not being able to spend this much time with my son, I just don't even know how I can handle that. I was okay with iop bc I would still be able to see him a ton but PHP, especially at erc, I'd be gone all day, 7 days a week. The weekend programming is a joke. It would take me an hour to get down there and an hour back via public transit. 

The other thing is my weight. My BMI is totally normal, which absolutely kills me bc I am doing so much to lose weight and it's not working. I keep binging at night on sweets bc I am so fucking hungry and I look forward to it all day long. I'd actually rather do a trauma PHP or mood PHP than an Ed one, bc I am just absolutely mortified at the thought of rolling into an Ed place in this body. Being weighed and having them see just how fat I actually am, that kills me. 

So that's where I am. I don't know if anyone is reading this absolute novel. I have never really bonded to my Ed therapist or dietician, bc I know that they will drop me if I am not at their rec level, which i totally understand and appreciate, but always having that in the back of my mind, I basically can never form any kind of therapeutic bond. It's also all remote and I just feel zero connection that way. So I don't super care if I don't see them anymore. Even my regular therapist, who I have been the most honest with out of everyone, if we have to terminate then okay. I'm kind of okay with just having an eating disorder and my life sucking, is what I'm saying. I don't think I have an eating disorder anymore anyway. I think I'm just like every other chubby woman in her 30's trying to lose weight. My entire day is spent around weighing myself, working out, counting down the time til it's time to eat. But is that abnormal? I legitimately don't know. 

The only thing I'm worried about is my meds, since I'm on this ultra high dose of pristiq and can't cold turkey off of that. If the psych won't treat me bc then I am sol, not bc I care about him but bc I physically don't know how I can come off this shit. I have tried many times to get him to reduce my dose so I can try to do my own taper but it's always been request denied. 

So that's where I'm at. At this point I think I will do erc's assessment, hoping they will say iop, and if they don't, then tell my providers I'm not interested in treatment and like if we need to break up that's cool, no hard feelings.",1643645092.0

I‚Äôm getting married in about 7 weeks and I feel so unloved and depressed. 
Today I tested positive for Covid. Which is whatever, I have autoimmune disorders and so I‚Äôve been pretty painful as one of my disorders is a rheumatoid disorder. 
I haven‚Äôt felt attractive in a long time. I recently ‚Äúrelapsed‚Äù I guess you could say. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight in a months time and I‚Äôm back to being afraid of water making me weigh more the next morning. Back to weighing 3-5 times a day. 
I am struggling to see my value. When I don‚Äôt connect intimately to my partner, I will end up convincing myself he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore or find me attractive. 
Being in that headspace can be really dangerous for me. My anxiety keeps me thinking I‚Äôm about to have a panic attack. 
I‚Äôve had debilitating panic attacks since 2018 but they‚Äôve improved over the last year or so. But being dizzy and/or sick mimics the sensations of a panic episode and this is enough to spin me out into a full blown panic attack.
I feel like nothing brings me joy. So many creative tasks need to happen to make the wedding happen but I feel apathetic.
For example; I need to make myself a flower crown but I keep thinking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?

Being sick has made it worse because I can‚Äôt get comfortable. The only place I like being is in our room but my partner won‚Äôt spend time with me upstairs so it‚Äôs just me alone.

So ive decided i want recovery after my partner had yet another chat with me after xmas when i hit my all time lowest weight saying i needed to put on weight before it started affecting our relationship. I was still in a place argueing in my head for a bit that i knew i needed to recover for other people but i didnt want it so wasnt actively doing anything to recover and was still loosing weight.

But then something clicked about 10 days ago and i decided i wanted recovery. So i started eating bit more, extreme hungers now started to enter the situation and im eating more smaller healthy snacks more regularly, im still very restricted and set in my routine of what i eat but ive introduced a few new healthy snacks and slowly introducing more. Ive put on a tiny bit of weight in 10 days. 

Problem is im still obsessively exercising and every day im doing more and more but i do realize i need to be eating so i do. 

I do want recovery but i want it to be done with right now, i dont want to fear il go into binge and purge cycles or just binges because i have in the past, i dont want to be obsessive over exercise, i dont want to have millions of fear foods. I just want to jump into a healthy but slim body and it be easy as that. 

Because i think extreme hungers hitting its worse then before. I used spend all day watching videos of people eating food and it felt great i wasnt eating it and itd be fine but now i spend all day just tortured by thinking about food in a different way of wanting it in a pyhiscal and emotional craving way. Im torturing myself with arguements in my head if i should or shouldnt give in. I still  try watch videos on youtube that are triggering/ pro ana material to me to try make myself not want food so i dont go eat. Yet i want recovery ... Idk. 

Its torture.

If i could just jump into a fit and healthy body right now id really be greatful. I want recovery with out all the torture of that comes with recovery.

I feel mentally exhausted  even though I'm good at my current job and I don't find it particularly stressful.

Figured I could use a place to talk about my relationship with eating, body image, and such things. My personal body image is very poor. I hate my body, for many reasons. My eating habits go through cycles of binging, purging, and starving. I'm somewhere in the middle right now. But with the near-constant urges to literally carve my body into a shape I like, there's a somewhat more rational thought of simply restricting my diet again. And sticking to it this time. I dropped a lot of weight in only a couple of months when I cut back my intake to essentially nothing but water. But then I started getting really hungry, and eventually I stopped losing weight, and I had an ER visit that landed me inpatient where they insisted on me eating more food.

The thing is, I feel like I had the right idea. I've gained back a lot of the weight I lost, but I'm certain I can drop it again - and more - by going back to that, plus adding in more exercise. I'm worried that my friends won't agree with me, and there's even a part of me that already doesn't agree with the idea. But nothing else works. I definitely can't afford any kind of surgery or medical procedure. Not that they'd let me do that, anyway, with my medical conditions. I just want to not be ugly or fat.

"""If this isn't resolved by the end of the year, I'm taking you somewhere.""

I've done the yo-yo dieting thing. The first time I lost a substantial amount of weight was when I was 16. I was very pleased with how I looked but the way people treated me was confusing. I have a mood disorder and at its worst, paranoia is a huge problem, so the extra eyes on me drove me mad, and I got really depressed. Also, I noticed boys would be really nice to me, then really mean after a while. I didn't understand at first, but it didn't take too long to click. I wrote in my online journal, ""I remember being happier when I was heavier."" And some asshole said something about me looking great now so I shouldn't feel bad. 

I gained and lost weight a lot through my life. Food was happiness and fun times. Something to look forward to. In 2019 I was at my heaviest. It was to the point where I needed to start thinking about taking medicine for hypertension. My husband gained a lot of weight while with me and he wanted to lose it. I half heartedly joined him. He started to lose weight and I wasn't as on board as him. I wanted to change because I was afraid it would hurt our marriage, kind of like two alcoholics with only one recovered. So I started to take things more seriously and was considering my diet more. I counted calories and they may have been a bit low to some people, but I wasn't starving myself and would indulge on special occasions. It felt amazing to be able to say no to food. 

The weight started dropping and pretty soon, I was doing it for myself. It was great to work at the same goal together. It made our marriage stronger and we were both more active and happy. I lost a substantial amount of weight and was at BMI healthy for the first time in over 15 years and a physical showed I was in great condition, particularly due to the exercising. 

Around the end of the year, I was having issues with my mood again. It was uncanny, I would just be crazy depressed for no reason. So I started eating again because I didn't care about anything. Later I realized that it was the weight loss that made me depressed: at that point, one of my medications was too much for my current body size, so taking those MG down made me feel a lot better. However, during that time of depression, I gained a decent amount. When I started to feel better, I was motivated to take the weight off that I gained. 

My mom always made me afraid of hunger. She acted like it was dire to make sure I ate even before I got hungry. I wanted to face my fears and I fasted for 2 days, just to see if I could do it. I did and I was proud of myself and went about a healthy diet. Eventually I was doing one meal a day and the calorie count started getting lower and lower. One day at work, they ordered my favorite pizza. I wanted it so bad and I ended up having two pieces. ""I really wish I hadn't done that...wait, I know what to do,"" and I made myself vomit. That's when it all started. 

It was freeing. I knew that it was bad for my body, but like someone just wanting to ""try"" heroin, I started to do it more and it became a habit. I wasn't awesome at it and eventually gave up when it became more and more difficult to get stuff up. I thought that would be a good time to tell my husband. 

He was really upset that I had been hiding something like that from him. He told me I need to get help or he would tell my family what's going on. I wasn't ready for that so I got a referral from my psychiatrist. 

The therapist I spoke to decided my needs were above her so she referred me to an ED specialist. My first session with her, she strongly suggested inpatient. I felt like she was overreacting, but her concern did make me take things more seriously and I had some bloodwork done. Everything was normal, so my therapist felt like I could do an outpatient program instead where I would go to the center mon-fri for a full day for a month. It's a hefty ask. I make the most money in my household. 

It's been a year since I started. I remember vomiting, then getting in the shower and saying, ""Maybe I do have an eating disorder, lol."" It took a while to click. 

This is so different from my mood disorder. It seems like how people with OCD describe their disease. They logically know their innate rituals do nothing to resolve their deep anxieties, but they simple cannot logic themselves out of the anxious thoughts that drive them to do their rituals. I am very familiar with anxiety, but this anxiety isn't accompanied by mood changes so it flies under the radar and simply becomes a normal thing. I know it's not, but I have to do it for some reason. 

It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm more focused on the purge aspect rather than the eating. Maybe my larger meals are a binge to others, but I don't see myself as binging most of the time. I do damage control with things I ""shouldn't have eaten"" or I vomit nearly everything in an attempt to lose weight. It's not the most effecient way, but it's the easiest for me and it does work. 

This experience has taught me a lot about my relationship with food. I can eat a standard amount, vomit up as much as I can, and feel like I've had a normal day of eating. I can feel the symptoms of extreme hunger, but it's fine because I'm mentally satisfied. I don't eat to live, I live to eat. 

I've gone back to purging being an everyday thing, sometimes twice or more. I had gotten more efficient at it, so it's become easier, and absolutely normal. I function normally and I'm very bubbly, so no one suspects anything. I've cried about it a few times, but it mostly has the same energy of me needing to go on a diet to lose weight. I reaaaallly shouldn't purge...maybe just a little. I'll stop this soon. 

And on that point, it was interesting to hear my therapist talk about what my diet could look like where I'm not obsessive about controlling it, but it not having control of me either. My response was exactly the same as hearing people give advice on how to lose weight. My brain just shuts off and it's just blah blah blah are you done yet? 

So that brings me to a couple days ago. I had the worst acid reflux of my life. I wondered if it was emergency worthy. I looked it up, pretty sure it was something I did to myself and sure enough... beforehand, I opted to keep my dinner down that night. Maybe that in conjunction with something I ate (maybe?) caused the problem. I took 10 tums which resolved the issue and I was able to go to sleep. 

But man, it hurt so bad. I was reading stories about people with bulimia having these symptoms for life even after recovery. This was my first major physical symptom. I knew it was coming. For God's sake, I make teeth for a living and I was actively attacking my enamel on the daily. I joke with myself that I could just make myself new teeth. Funny, but not funny at all. 

I'm afraid now...so I told my husband I had still been doing it. I've confessed this to him a couple other times and he was supportive since I was getting help. He is so oblivious though. He gets hyper focused on whatever he's doing and it can be difficult to get his attention, so I can purge very easily at home without having to worry about him finding out. 

But this time he said something along the lines of, ""I wanted to give you your space, but I gotta put my foot down on this. If this isn't resolved by the end of the year, I'm taking you somewhere. I don't want to lose you."" 

I felt a little numb then. I told him I agreed but also tried to excuse myself by saying it's probably not something I would die from, just really damage my body. I don't know how true that is. 

Later that night I woke up around 2 and he wasn't in bed as he tends to stay up late. Someone kindly linked me to this subreddit as I was asking if any older people were there. So I was perusing a bit and I flashed back to earlier. I was thinking about what he said. I remembered his eyes turning red and him tearing up...and him saying ""I wanted to give you space,"" touched me a lot. 

The worst part about this is lying to my husband. He puts so much trust in me that I don't deserve. I thought to myself, I wish I had hugged him and thanked him for caring so much. Then I remembered he was just downstairs so I decided to do it. I love him so much. Even if this doesn't kill me, that doesn't mean I won't lose him. 

I'm looking into that long term treatment. I think I qualify for short term disability and my parents have money and they would probably be happy to financially support us as I'm taking these measures.

Getting weighed in recovery,10,s3rzba,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/s3rzba/getting_weighed_in_recovery/,18,Is weighing yourself a massve trigger for anyone else? I'm doing online treatment and my dietician always really wants a weight. I've been refusing to weight myself the last few times and finally did yesterday. My weight was basically exactly in the middle of the range I thought it would be so not even a surprise but for some reason it's pushed me into a bit of a depression. I'm just determined to cut my eating until the next time I have to get weighed so it'll be lower and just can't stop crying today. I used to get my husband to weigh me so I wouldn't even need to see but to be honest that's no better as I can basically predict what it will be based on how my body is and even the thought of the weight being out there to be known by someone else freaks me out. I am honestly considering just ducking out of treatment all together to avoid the issue even coming up but this has freaked out my husband as he thinks I'll go back to being super underweight again and that I haven't really mentally recovered yet (the latter is definitely true).,1642165767.0

I developed pretty serious Anorexia at age 12 due to being in a sport where a slim frame was extremely important and experiencing things like public weigh ins and body shaming from coaches starting at age 9. I struggled with this until eventually switching to Bulimia in my late-teens. After oscillating between the two for a while longer I eventually said, enough. Following several hospitalizations over the years and a final residential treatment stay, I entered recovery in earnest in my mid-twenties. I'm now in my early 30s and have been in solid recovery (unlike anything I could ever have imagined before) for years now. I truly had let this past go, I no longer defined myself as anything to do with my former ED and was able to live quite freely and normally for years.

I've recently had to deal with the death of a loved one that has utterly torn me apart, in addition to several other truly horrible situational factors that have caused my day to day living to be seeped in stress and devoid of all joy. I now feel myself slipping into a place I thought I'd long ago closed the door on. It has't become full blown yet, I haven't reached a place of being horribly underweight (from visual assessment because I learned in early recovery that a scale is *not* something I can have in my house or a switch is flicked in my brain and I quickly devolve into disordered behavior) but the red flags are there.

I've begun restricting like I used to, playing those childish games with myself to see how long I can go without eating, enjoying the feeling of hunger pains, jeans that used to be snug now hang loose, etc. But what scares me the most is the comfort I'm finding in these behaviors. It feels sickly familiar, like reconnecting with an old friend. I've definitely been through shit and hard times during recovery but this is the first time I've found myself returning to these behaviors. I don't really know what my purpose is for posting this, but I've kept this inside for several months now and had to let it out somewhere.",1642159515.0

I brought in the chair scale that has the display screen mounted on the back, so she wouldn't have to see the numbers. Aaaand the nurse who was with me exclaimed with a sigh, ""God, you weigh half of me,"" in what was unmistakably a longing tone as the numbers came up on the screen.

As a sufferer myself I know how harmful that kind of comment can be. I wanted to challenge it then and there by saying something like, ""You're a healthy weight.

For context:

About 3 years ago I was severely overweight for the second time in my life. I healthfully lost a good amount, but as we all know, it's so easy to fall back into restrictive habits (which I had 10+ years ago when I met my husband). I dropped a significant amount of weight in a short period of time and he noticed. He got worried. Then he got angry. Then he got scared. 

I lost my period even though I'm in the normal range (and I'm definitely not pregnant). I started having chronic and sometimes debilitating hypoglycemia. I bruise at the slightest bump. 

I've been discussing recovery with my husband for a month now. He and I have both worked together and determined that the help I need is just not available where I live. So I've been trying to do it on my own. I've continued searching for any resources I can that might be available (sometimes desperately) but for now I'm on my own. I've been doing okay, but any time I eat enough to feel full, it's suddenly instant panic mode. I still can't get over the need to be thin. 

Logically, I know I'm an idiot. I'm a healthy weight and if I eat more, that won't necessarily change. My husband loves me, and he did when I was obese too. People are worried, my health is failing, and still... I just can't make myself do it. 

I guess I'm just venting. I wish I could magically fix myself. I'm tired and hungry and miserable and still not thin enough for myself. I've had various EDs for over two thirds of my life now, and I'm just... tired.

I feel like I'm failing my husband because I can't give him this one thing.",1641951882.0

I mostly restrict, but I also binge/purge. Before then, I used to maintain a very normal and healthy adult weight without any restriction or notion of calories, BMI etc. whatsoever. 

Now I'm starting to feel way too old for this shit. I know it doesn't make sense because EDs are not about age, but still - I just feel I wanna leave my ED behind FOR REAL and not just for a couple months. I am ready to live my life as an adult. This shit has ruined 6 years of my life already. I'm tired. I'm not this. 

Between September and December 2021 I had a terrible relapse. I restricted so much and by December I met the criteria for clinically severe Anorexia. I was cold, weak, tired, unable to think straight, unable to focus, concentrate or work productively. I was moody and constantly irritable and snappy. I could only think about food.

On the 24th, I went back home to spend the Christmas holidays with my family. And my mom was once again shocked at how thin I was. So I took that as an opportunity to recover. I didn't have to work, I was with my family, surrounded by delicious food...it was the right time to kick start my recovery.

I told myself: now you're gonna eat at least 3 meals and 3 snacks EVERY DAY. No compromise. Since I have a history of binging/purging, I thought this would have helped to curb the binges (I only purge when I binge) while still allowing me to gain weight in a way I could cope with.

But then...I started eating. And I ate. And I ate. And 3 meals and 3 snacks are just not gonna cut it.

In the past 14 days I went from severely underweight to normal BMI. I don't even know how it's physically possible. I see all these people that recover ""the right way"", following a ""normal meal plan"" set up by a dietitian, gradually gaining weight and slowly opening up to new foods...and then I try this and after having had a very substantial breakfast I find myself raiding the pantry and eating whatever. Today it's not even lunchtime and I've already eaten more than what should be my total for the day. As an adult, eating like a person with Anorexia is embarrassing enough, but eating like a 15 year old highly active male teenager is even worse.

I don't understand how I will recover. I do wanna recover, but I also don't want to become overweight or obese. I'm no longer that young and being overweight is gonna be a problem for me at some point. But at the same time, how am I supposed to eat like I used to before my ED? My meal plan is already way more than that and I cannot manage to stick to it because my body always takes over and I end up eating the whole kitchen and then some.

For me, growing up with control freaks/narcissists who always wanted to control my every move, and then later interpersonal traumas such as sexual assault, both in and out of the military, robbery, and being abused (not by a romantic partner-family members and military personnel) gave me a sense of having no control.

But for some reason winter is a difficult time of year and I find it harder to stay on track.

Problem: My partner and I take it in turns to cook, but we usually agree together what the meal should be. Lately he's been experimenting more with different ingredients and cooking things in new ways. On Boxing Day I was in tears because he'd cooked all the vegetables in such a gloopy buttery sauce that I couldn't eat them, and the vegetables were what I was most looking forward to. He knows I hate the smell and texture of butter, but from his perspective he only used a small amount and he wanted to try a new recipe that looked tasty. From my perspective, he took a gamble that meant I couldn't eat or enjoy any of the veg. We talked it out and I said it would have been better if he'd just cooked one type of veg in a buttery sauce, because that way if I didn't like it I could have at least had the other veg. I don't want to make him abide by my rigid food rules but I need to know there will be at least one thing on the table I can definitely eat. He agreed to do that in future.

Then tonight he substituted the vegetarian mince we always have in our fajitas with shredded vegetarian duck. This changed the texture, the taste, and the calorie count. Ordinarily it wouldn't have bothered me, but as I say, I'm more fragile anyway in winter and I felt really upset. I couldn't eat as much as I wanted. I think it really will be imposing my ED on him if I try to make him stick to using one type of fake meat over others, but I wanted to gain a sense of what's reasonable, and just to vent a bit. üò•",1640893326.0

I chainsmoke, rarely cook, rarely clean, and I have zero willpower. I know I have mental health problems but I hide them well enough. I work for myself at home so the pandemic isolation and general isolation is hurting me worse. I can‚Äôt hide being fat and it‚Äôs making me even more anxious, isolated and depressed.

I had a surgery and now chronic illness that makes it impossible to do strenuous exercise. I can walk but not much else.

Growing up, my family would control my weight and watch everything I ate. They would make me run almost daily, wasn‚Äôt allowed to eat things my brother or they would eat. I was always in shape.

I moved out 4 years ago from my parents house. I have since gained 1/8 of my weight and am unable to see them in person at this weight bc the last time my dad attacked me and said no one will ever love me.

I was torn between just letting it run its course because I‚Äôm just sick of fighting it all these years, or just nipping it in the bud.  Changed my mind to wanting to fight it again and I‚Äôve had good success with small, increasing amounts of superfoods and light soups, like Lipton Chicken Noodle. Just recently added chicken into my diet and today had Lipton Chicken Noodle even though that one reminds me of my abusive mother.  It‚Äôs still easy to eat, not calorie dense.

And, gradually increasing my amounts of superfoods.  Got a bag of dried goji berries from the Asian market and snacking on a few of those here and there.  A few pistachios here and there.
Garbanzos are an excellent superfood too, protein and fiber with a good amount of micro nutrients. Got Bush‚Äôs Best Rustic Tuscany in a can, they are delicious even cooked in the microwave. Appetite doing better so was able to eat a half can of them today!  Earlier today I had baked breaded cod too, trying to get plenty of protein. (I know Unbreaded would have been better but this was all I had)
I‚Äôm afraid of losing muscle mass again from poor nutrition so I am focusing on getting enough protein.  I‚Äôve had good success with eating one or two eggs too.  Small and easy to handle most times, nutrient dense.  

Mochi (also from Asian Market) is easy to eat too, it‚Äôs an old favorite of mine. Good recovery food for me. Many people don‚Äôt like the texture of Mochi but I find it delightful.  It‚Äôs not exactly a superfood, it‚Äôs like a slightly healthier version of candy.

Roasted Seaweed snacks and miso soup are also very good recovery foods for me, kelp too.

My daughter brought home cookies she made at school.,7,rine1y,Eatingdisordersover30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/rine1y/my_daughter_brought_home_cookies_she_made_at/,4,"She‚Äôs a teenager, so I knew they would be nice and not full of hair and bogeys and stuff. I also knew I couldn‚Äôt have a nibble then distract her while I threw the rest of it away, like if it was my six year old.

My mind went WILD. I‚Äôve been losing weight for 2.5 months and I wasn‚Äôt planning to start my (self-designed) refeeding plan for Christmas until Monday. I had it in my head that if I kept going until then I might just hit the weight I‚Äôve had in mind which will make eating more over Christmas okay. If I ate the cookie it would take away that possibility. And it might make me binge and I would lose everything and possibly get refeeding syndrome. 

I used some delaying tactics while I thought about excuses I could make to her but that idea made me feel really guilty. And I realised that part of me really, really wanted the cookie and that made me feel ashamed. So I did some quick mental calculations and decided to start my refeeding plan three days earlier and that made it okay and I knew I wouldn‚Äôt binge. I also knew I wouldn‚Äôt be hitting my current goal weight before Christmas but at least I have my planner written out until August so, with some tweaks, I know when I‚Äôll be meeting my goals. 

I just wanna know if anyone has these same problems. 

1. Trying to pass as a normal mother who can take the cookie her child offers her without it causing a mental crisis. Feeling horribly guilty about it, feeling like you are failing motherhood and thinness all in one situation.

2. Planning your life months in advance. Freaking out when something unexpectedly disrupts the plan and needing to referee a battle between the ‚Äúbinge monster‚Äù and the ‚Äúrestriction monster‚Äù.

So, what's my ED brain response to that? Well, seeing as I can't do anything except sleep, I may as well heavily restrict until I get my glasses and can function like a person again. I'm not saying I will do this, but I am saying that the ED voice is very loud because it's always like this when I can't do enough to ""earn"" my food, and then I don't feed myself anything good because I don't deserve the nutrition

I‚Äôve explained all this in another post, but I decided to try to recover for her sake and our children‚Äôs last summer. I did IE, gained seven BMI points, tried to tolerate it, then got fat shamed by her mum and relapsed. 

It‚Äôs been over two months since that happened. In that time she‚Äôs been sad, she‚Äôs been worried, she‚Äôs been perplexed and frustrated, but this weekend she was ANGRY. She started acting really grumpy, moody and bitter which is a side I haven‚Äôt seen in her for a long time. I didn‚Äôt know why she was acting that way, and she said there were several factors, but the main one is that she feels like she  barely sees me or gets to talk to me, I am constantly tense and distracted, I am hiding things from our children. She spoke of how happy we were over the summer when I was eating unrestrictedly, and therefore not obsessing over food or structuring my whole life around it. She is really upset and angry that we‚Äôve lost that.

As a teen/young woman I was naturally thin. Probably a bit underweight. I could eat what I wanted and never gain weight. So I never really thought about the relationship between my intake and my shape, except when talking to my lifelong best friend, who had an ED and was understandably jealous of my effortless thinness. I wished I could give it to her, it didn‚Äôt mean much to me (or so I thought). 

In my mid-twenties I started gaining a bit. I got the uncomfortable feeling that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúme‚Äù anymore because of my changed shape, but I could mostly put it to the back of my mind. I tried dieting a couple of times but it didn‚Äôt last. My BMI was still well within the healthy range and I knew it was normal to gain slightly at my age, so I tolerated it.

After turning 30 something changed and I decided I could no longer bear not being thin. I started following a well-known, popular diet and lost a lot. I made no connection in my mind between this diet and my friend‚Äôs ED behaviours in the past (she had by now recovered, and has stayed that way for 10-15 years). My colleagues made no secret that they found it weird and unhealthy for the slimmest woman in the office to be dieting, but I disregarded their concerns. I was just doing something normal people did, and my goal was to get to the bottom of my healthy range, not to be underweight. 

I got there, and stayed there for a while, and was happy. But over the next few years I intentionally gained it all back two or three times, because I felt so guilty about the risk of my daughter trying to imitate my size or behaviours, and then I couldn‚Äôt tolerate my size and lost it all again. This has been my constant battle, between that guilt about my daughter and my discomfort with my size, for nearly a decade now. (for what it‚Äôs worth, I genuinely don‚Äôt think she has ever guessed. I hide it extremely carefully and also she is self-absorbed like all teenagers, thank goodness).

In the last couple of years I have been mostly thin but have been in a cycle of restricting/fasting all week then bingeing at the weekends. This is what finally made me realise I had an ED and tell my partner about it. She got me to see how it was affecting the whole family, not just my daughter. How everyone‚Äôs lives were (unbeknownst to them) shaped by my rules about when I was allowed to eat and when I wasn‚Äôt. 

So I decided to, not just gain weight this time, but to recover. In July this year I started following Intuitive Eating. I did really well for almost three months and our lives changed so much. We were so happy. I was more relaxed about household routines and more able to spend time with my partner and children. It was great‚Ä¶except that I gained a LOT of weight, faster than I even knew was possible. My mother-in-law made some insensitive comments and it felt like a switch flipped in my head and I was back to restricting, harder than ever before, in the full knowledge this time that I was doing something abnormal and unhealthy. I have now lost almost all the weight I gained. 

I wonder if anyone feels the way I do. I don‚Äôt have anything in common with younger people with EDs and I wonder if I do with anyone 
 my age. My partner sometimes reads the accounts of younger people to me and asks if I feel that way. Things like, ‚ÄúI want to be just bones and parched skin, I want to fade away to nothing‚Äù. I can honestly reassure her that I do not feel that way. I don‚Äôt want to die. I want to be here for her and our children. I drink loads of water and religiously take my multivitamin, electrolytes, calcium etc. I don‚Äôt want to look nearly-dead either, I just want to be thin. When my body starts telling me it‚Äôs in trouble, like I go dizzy or get palpitations or my period stops, I freak out and try to eat a bit more for a while. 

So that‚Äôs me and I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm not the only one this has happened to or who feels this way. Thanks for reading and if there is anything triggering here please tell me and I‚Äôll remove it, my worst nightmare would be to make anyone else feel worse or do worse things, which is why I haven‚Äôt mentioned any numbers or gone into details about behaviours.",1639235131.0

I developed my ED for a variety of reasons. That aside though, what was it like for you? It was far more isolating, which if course was satisfying. 
Our "" Tips and Tricks "" and thinspiration took more time and resources. We had to flip pages, scroll a slow loading screen on the family computer because dial up was a blessing, and cell phones had no internet and pixelated screens. 
No one talked about eating disorders, you were sad so you didn't eat, and when you felt tooooo empty emotionally and physically you binged and purged, shamefully and as quietly as possible. 
You wrote in a journal, with pastel gel pens. Tracked everything you ate that day, what your weight was when you woke, after you pooped. That's to assume you even can, or your completely depleted of electrolytes from taking a sleeve of pink ' women's laxative '
Your weights down, but the pay-off was shakes, sweats, cramps, and the constant muscle contraction you feel around your butthole as it plays tug of war whether to extend contract. 
Your thinspiration came monthly in the form of Teen People or Cosmo Girl. 
You had to learn through trial and error. Ask Jeeves and proana threads were a few years away. 
You had no one to talk to about your debilitating anxiety, about most anything. But especially food. 
You often thought you were the only one, and what you were doing was super messed up. Yet it felt like it just developed naturally along with you. 
Sizes were smaller, yet you still had to shop at Le Chateau Jr.  (Which was a blessing of a store) as The Olson Twins clothing line at K Mart was a bit to juvenile to enter high school wearing. 
 
As time, and technology have drastically changed, what does the new millennial ED look like? Are the warning signs the same? 
Are 80's kids/teens, who now in our 30s and 40s 2021/21 recovered? What are the statistics 
Are 2000's teens still living in hiding because there have yet learn how to recover.
