After going to therapy for more than a year, I've been slowly coming to terms that I have orthorexia. I'm anxious about eating out, I weigh out every food I eat, and if I miss working out, I go into a depressive episode. Physically, I'm in very good shape, but mentally, I'm exhausted having to think about everything I allow myself to eat. And as you know, mental health is the foundation for all things health.

I just wanted to say that you're not alone and solving any problem starts with recognizing that there is one. Now that I've discovered this subreddit, I would love to stay engaged with all of you.

Have a great weekend! Don't be me and let yourself eat good food. I'll be eating my unsalted spinach & turkey breast...",1645239087.0
Has anyone been able to strike a balance?,3,st6l80,Orthorexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orthorexia/comments/st6l80/has_anyone_been_able_to_strike_a_balance/,2,"Or at least know of any good resources that might help? I’m in therapy but my insurance is almost out so I’m looking for some self help stuff. I have a very much all or nothing approach to eating, if I’m in my “junk” mindset I literally eat whatever I want whenever I want, mostly sugary and greasy processed foods, fast food every day (sometimes 2-3 times a day), going weeks without touching a fruit or vegetable. Then when I go into “healthy” mode I obsess about nutrients, pesticides, free radicals, saturated fat, etc. Refuse to have any treats and a normal meal (like spaghetti and meatballs or homemade pizza) feels like eating poison. I need to find a happy medium so I can be happy and healthy but I just can’t seem to do it",1644941829.0
going down the orthorexic rabbit hole,6,sj6rmk,Orthorexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orthorexia/comments/sj6rmk/going_down_the_orthorexic_rabbit_hole/,5,"recently i feel like i've started to develop genuine orthorexia. i've never had disordered eating and i honestly quite want to put weight on.

since these past few months i have gone further down the rabbit hole bc i have been sick. i started being sick in 2018 and it's not gotten better (infections, liver/gall bladder pain, bloating, horrible pain and pressure in my lower left abdomen). i realized i was reacting to gluten (especially fried gluten) and i cut it out. i do feel a little bit better but not much.

and now i've gain this obsession with eating 'right' to control my symptoms. i've found out about oxalates, then phytic acid, then lectins. and now, as of this week, apparently all nightshades, all cruciferous veggies, most fruits are also out of the list as per articles like ones from doctor kiltz (i won't post here bc i do not want to trigger anyone). but it's become so bad that i am afraid of most food that isn't meat, hard cheese, bananas and pineapple. i hear so many proponents of carnivore eating and it makes so much sense to me but it strikes me as impossible. i've been used to have a veggie/starch side with my mains all my life.

it sucks enough that i can't have homemade chicken noodle soup or ramen bc they have gluten i don't wanna cut out all veggies. some ppl say you should never have tomatoes but i love them :(. and don't get me started about sugar - i have been a lifelong hardcore addict - i ONLY drank coca cola, never water, i ate one dessert a day, i used to start my day off with croissants. now i've reduced it to one soda day and replaced all the sugar with fruit- but now i binge on fruit - i have bananas, pineapple, red and green grapes every day. i feel like a maniac i'm craving and eating a whole damn bowl of grapes a day and now i've found out they're bad bc oxalates phenols tannins. gaaaah i'm going crazy. i'm at the point where i need to know which is the safer option of a side dish between mash potatoes and white rice.

i use to be indifferent or proud of eating veggies and healthy meat. now - today for ex - i had wild norwegian salmon with boiled broccoli and it was delicious - but then i immediately started to regret bc apparently cruciferous veggies damage the mitochondria and our digestive enzymes.

 i don't know what to do - i clearly react to gluten and added sugar - but i don't want to become a carnivore - as much as i love meat - i love veggies too. idk has anyone ever debunked this, is this all just bs, or people peddling their own interests? phytates seem to be legit. sorry for the long post i just need a strategy or advice or just to vent before i go devour a bag of oxalate-phytate-lectin laden potato chips :(.",1643853574.0

Just need to vent.,12,rio5do,Orthorexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orthorexia/comments/rio5do/just_need_to_vent/,8,"Earlier this year I took a nutrition class for uni. Studying nutrition made me realize how shitty my diet was and how it could potentially harm my future health. 

Starting in September I cut out processed foods, dairy, red meat, and most carbs. I became obsessed with the idea of eating “clean” and “whole” foods. 
Truthfully weight loss was not at the forefront of my mind when making these dietary changes. I just really wanted to be healthy and feel good which I did at first. 

From then to now I’ve dropped a significant amount of weight and experience loads of side effects daily. I’m constantly dizzy, my hair is falling out by the handfuls, I can hear my pulse in my ear, I’ve even passed out for the first time ever. 

I recently had a physical with my Dr. and he was concerned with my recent symptoms and overall food intake. He said I eat really clean but encouraged me to be balanced. He ordered an EKG and it came back abnormal… 

Im currently wearing a heart monitor for a couple of weeks and I've never felt so helpless. I feel like it’s my fault. 

I know that my relationship with food is not normal. My mom thinks I’ve developed an ED and wants me to get help If I continue to loose weight. Is it weird that I feel like I don’t have an ED? I don’t count calories or weigh myself. I eat, I exercise, I take vitamins/supplements, I sleep plenty.

I was later diagnosed with endometriosis and had surgery which has helped a lot. I’ve also had thyroid issues causing my weight to fluctuate a ton. 

I get very stressed out worrying that I’m not eating healthy enough and that it’s my own fault for having medical problems. I always feel if I could just be healthier, eat cleaner, lose more weight my health will be better, if not it’s my own fault I’m sick.

I thought I was faking an eating disorder,38,mqwoes,Orthorexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orthorexia/comments/mqwoes/i_thought_i_was_faking_an_eating_disorder/,9,"Very recently, within the past couple of months, I've been learning about orthorexia after a friend approached me about my eating habits. I've struggled with body image since the age of 11, when my mother lovingly pointed out that my little stomach could be seen under my tank top. I say little because I used to always compare my body TO MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD BODY and think ""well I've always been fat"" despite being a completely healthy weight. My parents always encouraged healthy eating (no fast food, no microwave dinners, no ""junk food""), and used negative words and connotations to reinforce a healthy eating mindset. I've been restricting what I put into my body since I hit double digits, and before that it was just my parents restricting it for me. I don't think my parents ever encouraged eating disorder behavior, but growing up I never had a good relationship with food because of this. I would binge on junk food when I went to my friends' houses since I never got to have it at my own house. Once I got my license, I loved going to drive thru fast food places more for the experience than the actual food. In high school, I would meal prep everything just to control myself; because otherwise I would go HAM in the cafeteria. In 2017 I suffered a TBI that left me without the ability to feel hunger. That on top of a poor relationship with food made me stop eating for a while. I thought this was normal. Freshman year of college I passed out during a final presentation because I forgot to eat for 3 days. At first, my lack of eating wasn't intentional, I just had no desire to put calories in my body if I couldn't even feel hunger. There was no satisfaction, just guilt. In college, I became obsessed with my health. I turned to supplements to ensure I was getting the most out of my body. I would skip class to go work out, and my body looked amazing so that reinforced the bad behaviors. Once I moved out of the dorms I became even more obsessed with my health since now I could cook all my own meals. This was the first time I could go to the grocery store and get what I wanted to eat, not just what was available to me. I would feel so guilty spending money on junk food that eventually I stopped. I would only buy whole foods (fresh produce and no freezer meals kinda thing). I cut dairy out of my diet completely, and slowly started cutting meat out as well. Now, the only meat I eat is chicken. Everything I do just looks like me being healthy, but it's all I think about. I can't bring myself to finish a meal anymore. I worry about the calories I'm eating before even swallowing my food. I cant make a non-whole-food food purchase without comparing nutrition facts and reading labels. I can tell you the protein, fat, and carbohydrate content of most foods just from memory. It's not even about losing weight anymore, I can see my rib cage just looking in the mirror and that not what I want. I just wanted to be healthy and it's completely taken over my life. I used to think I was being dramatic, or faking an eating disorder; but how can I be faking something if I don't talk to anyone about it and suffer alone? I don't know how to get out of this cycle, but I haven't enjoyed food in at least 5 years. It is such a struggle to put any food in my mouth without considering what it might do to my body; either the image or just my health in general. I'm anemic (maybe I should take iron pills?), my hair is falling out (but is it just the bleach?), I've lost all interest in the things I used to care about (maybe I'm just depressed?), I avoid going out to eat with my friends because menus don't have the nutrition labels for every ingredient available. My god I think I suffer from orthorexia, but it's almost as if I don't want to change because that change scares me more. Does anyone understand what I am saying here...?",1618424698.0

So I’ve recently released my first music video, called ‘Use me’. It deals with bulimia, struggling to conform to the increasing pressures of society, drugs, mental health and fun things like that.
I was formerly a high fashion model, which massively fucked me up, and I suffered with anorexia and then bulimia. I later bought my way out of my contract as I recognised I was no longer willing to, quite literally, change myself for other people.
I remember my bulimic / anorexic days so well. Food was all I thought about. It ruled my life. I was scared of bread. Hunger heightened my anxiety. I couldn’t imagine time where I would never NOT think about food.
But that time did come. And it’s such a good time.
My latest BTS from this music video discusses more. By all means check it out. I’ll post the music video and the BTS below.

How I ended my food obsession,11,co2u91,Orthorexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orthorexia/comments/co2u91/how_i_ended_my_food_obsession/,0,"Hello Orthorexia Reddit,

About 2 years ago I decided to become a vegan. Throughout that time, my eating habits have changed greatly. However, this was partly because eating and learning about food became my new pass-time. In retrospect, I don't blame myself -- this insecurity was like a doctor who puts itself out of business.

I went through various stages in eating and beliefs about eating. I initially tried making omnivore favorites: tacos, chili, marinated chickens, burgers, and baked potatoes. Soon, my research on food led me to partially and finally completely restrict myself from artificial meats and other foods.

I found myself reading the 811 diet manifesto. I seriously doubted what the author was saying, but I still tried it. I actually liked being on the diet. I lost weight, which I didn't need; stopped caring about food, and enjoyed making meals. I only ate when I was hungry and ate smaller portions when pressured.

After becoming almost emaciated on this plan, I decided to eat normally again. However, I then developed extremely impulsive behavior, especially during my semester. If there was a food I liked, or leftovers, or anything, I would eat all of it. I started having these piercing headaches that occurred by the middle of the day. Then, I would obsess over food and overeat, which induced further headache and further overeating. I would eat so much that I couldn't do basic yoga.

However, this headache and my subsequent my obsession wasn't uncalled for. I was looking for answers, and I found *the ultimate* culprit for this obsession. My years of recollection about what I ate played a central role in this. These headaches only began after I ate a salty lunch, but no salty breakfast. For most of my time, I wouldn't feel the headache because I had a salty breakfast. So, whether it be the salt from your can of beans or slice of bread, it made me very concerned about food throughout the day and ultimately overeat. I should've known when I habitually started eating an entire box of Ezekiel cereal!

It then made sense, then, why I enjoyed a nearly fruitarian diet: there's almost no added salt. Since eliminating salt, all food worries of mine have gone away. My productivity and happiness have vastly improved, and I can focus on more pressing issues in my life.

If you have orthorexia or think you have orthorexia, please consider removing salt from your diet. It seems counter-intuitive to restrict the restricted further, but health and the obsession over health are separate. For me to realize this, I discovered that nutrition, weight, and food needed to be secondary to my mental health. But, in focusing on that, I believe that I now have better health overall.

Surprisingly, my experience with uncontrollable appetite under salt is shared by Russian cosmonauts: [https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/news/20170501/salt-weight-connection](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/news/20170501/salt-weight-connection)",1565359574.0

It's really driving a wedge between us and ruining us :( thank you.
