Struggling to eat enough with dietary restrictions - I'm barely managing maintenance and can't even comprehend full recovery like this,11,swye7x,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/swye7x/struggling_to_eat_enough_with_dietary/,11,"So I'm celiac (never had any issues sticking to that after diagnosis) and I'm currently in the process of getting tested for a genetic condition that means I can't process protein. While I'm waiting to hear about that and what the treatment options would be I've cut out as much protein as possible because I just couldn't deal with the physical symptoms anymore (being in constant pain from what you're eating makes eating even harder). Things have settled physically which is great but even I, who finds great comfort in eating the same thing each day, can only deal with so much of each food at a time/per day.

My diet consists of bread (gluten free, and there's only one good-ish option in my country), rice (limited), pasta sauce, carrots, pumpkin, green beans (limited), and apples. I can only deal with so much bread (it's a huge ""fear food"" of mine but I'm currently eating four slices a day...) and everything else is high volume/low cal so I can't really increase it for more calories easily. If I can't even manage maintenance how am I ever supposed to be able to manage full recovery???

Any ideas welcome but please keep in mind I'm not in the US and packaged gluten free foods are not very good/abundant here",1645352945.0
Extreme(?) hunger without being in full recovery and other fun things.,21,swpdcg,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/swpdcg/extreme_hunger_without_being_in_full_recovery_and/,6,"For the past 3-4 weeks I’ve been eating at maintenance because I was getting scared for my health after losing XX lbs in a short amount of time. I’m slightly above an underweight BMI, and even though I’m eating at maintenance, I’m starting to get really hungry. I’m craving food all the time, and it feels like I’ve been eating too much and gaining weight, but I still hit the same amount and my weight hasn’t really budged. 

I don’t consider myself in full recovery or even quasi recovery sometimes, but I’m starting crack…I’m freaking hungry! But to lose the control I have is terrifying. Like I said, it feels like my body is expanding already, so I can’t imagine completely surrendering to its wants. That being said, I sometimes wish for my healthier body back, oddly enough. This confirms to me that it’s not about my body but a sense of control and coping. I know I can’t keep going like this - my body will eventually take over or give out - but I already don’t feel sick enough because this is the highest weight I’ve been at in a relapse and I’m eating maintenance for goodness sake. 

I keep telling myself I need to just do it (eat and gain weight) because I’m graduating soon and must have energy for a full time job. This ED crap needs to be left behind in my college years. But holy shit is this terrifying and what if I gain too much weight, what if it doesn’t settle back where it was…This is more of a ramble than anything, maybe a cry for help, idk.

It did. They changed their rec to PHP, and after waiting just a few weeks they called, and I admit tomorrow.

I thought eating disorders aren't based on numbers. I thought you can have an eating disorder at any size. I thought the severity of eating disorders isn't necessarily based on weight.

My ED is turning me into an alcoholic,67,ssr2hv,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/ssr2hv/my_ed_is_turning_me_into_an_alcoholic/,20,"Obviously I know that after laxatives, alcohol is about the worst thing you can put into an empty stomach. But I also know that entirely socially isolating myself is a recipe for many mental health disasters. The only way I can manage to have any personality, sense of humor, or interest in anything other than my ED is to get at least 2 or 3 units of alcohol in me. It's also just nice to have a vacation from my ED-addled wasteland of a mind. I don't drink alone--only when I have to socialize with other people, but that's turning into binge drinking (around 4 drinks on a totally empty stomach which hits me like 8) at least 3 nights a week.

""Socializing with other people"" includes being around the guy I'm seeing as well, because no WAY can I flirt or fuck sober. I just cannot be a fully engaged, interesting/interested human being while sober. Sober me is a brain-fogged, calorie counting, cabbage leaf weighing, kitchen pacing, shivering, passionless zombie. But slightly toasted me is witty, adventurous, charismatic, and sexy. It's the me I'm only occasionally capable of being fully-recovered, which is not an option.

It means I'm now doing a lot of surreptitious boozing—carrying water bottles half-full of tequila (lowest cal liquor) and ginger/lemon juice (to mask the smell) with me on dates and even work meetings. On the days when I'm not drinking, I'm hungover. I count my booze intake into my daily calorie limit so that means I'm getting even less nutrition on the days I drink. I know that my go-to excuse of ""well, I never drink alone"" is becoming a flimsy one. But I can't bear the thought of quitting because it's the only way I can manage being around other human beings.

So guess whose nurse spent a big chunk of our meeting talking about the calories in corn cakes (same product as rice cakes but taste a little bit less like cardboard). Well, that would be my nurse.

Long story short, a few years ago I lost a lot of weight, became disordered, went into therapy, got out of disordered tendencies, gained half of the weight back and am now in the process of seeing a nurse monthly about making sustainable changes to the way I eat to lose weight in a very long scale window. My doctor said I shouldn’t lose weight unsupervised.

I’ve been hella unmotivated recently and have been eating more than I should and have thus gained weight. I told the nurse as much. For some UNGODLY reason she became completely focused on me eating corn cakes instead of bread (a remnant from my ED days yes, but also they have a long shelf life and I genuinely, hand on a Bible, enjoy eating them with toppings like salmon, they have a nice crunch). 

So, the nurse literally googles the calorie count in one corn cake (”what could it weigh? 15 grams” ”I don’t know, I DON’T WEIGH MY FOOD ANYMORE”) and she was like SHOCKED that two corn cakes had 100 or so calories. They fucking don’t by the way, I checked as I got home and they’re lighter than she thinks. I was really annoyed and told her that I don’t think the point of this meeting is to discuss the calorie count of corn cakes. But the damage was already done.

Fuck the corn cakes. I feel guilty as hell eating them. Two rice cakes topped with salmon. The biggest crime ever. She told me I should eat veggies to fill up my stomach (sus?). I bought a few kilograms of carrots. I ate four carrots today and then had my evening meal and now my stomach hurts so fucking bad so I guess I filled it TOO MUCH with ”delicious” carrots. Fuck having any enjoyment in food anymore. My day comprises now of forcing myself to eat bland, boring food four times a day. And when I do eat something I like, I feel guilty about it. Yay!

the only thing is i just can tell anymore if im too hungry or full. i feel constantly bloated as soon as im awake. i go from feeling starving in the morning and sick too feeling so full after eating or drinking one thing ( like a sip of water or a gummy vitamin). i go too bed feeling sick from being so full and plan too restrict the next day and then when the day comes i just want too eat again. when i cant tell if i feel
full or not is it better too eat or not? i rly dont know. 

things are still harder than i think they are and i find myself so worried the more i continue eating like this that ill never get my ed 'back' silly ik but im fucking terrified by it. not scared enough apparently though too start restricting again😐. its like my body doesnt agree w it anymore but i know its the right thing. just confused and stressed. any advice thank u lovely ppl <3",1644752144.0

when we were at sixth form, one of my friends had anorexia. I have had disordered eating patterns for years and years, and spent a while underweight but was never diagnosed. I did try to ask my GP, but I was told it was undereating caused by depression. We were clever and very intense at an all-girls school.

my friend was much more ill than me, or she looked it. I remember her telling me her BMI was about >!14!< and I treated that as a goal BMI for years. all our friends were worrying about her and asking me about it. she was diagnosed, she got treatment, she very slowly got better. My other friend is coming to stay too, and she has always been very thin.

that was ten years ago, ish. she is coming to stay with me in two months (I bought a house with my partner! why can I not focus on that !) and I've already started to think about how much I can lose, where I can cut corners, excuses I can make, how to go to the gym more. And because I am out of the habit of restriction (I am 5'10 and about >!165lb!< right now! I hate it but this is a HEALTHY weight for me) it is so much harder than it used to be. When I was a teenager, I could coast on >!500 calories!< a day, do a whole day at school or uni, and then go running, see my friends, etc. Now I am tired and irritable and I get dizzy and I am not losing any fucking weight because as soon as I get hungry I cave in. I struggle to even eat under >!1000!<. I do go to the gym most days but only burn like >!300 calories!< according to my fitbit.

Ideally, I would like to lose >!20lb in two months!<. >!2.5lb !<a week. Done the maths, and that would mean >!1000 calories !<a day net. My phone is full of worst-case scenarios for weight loss, weeks planned out to October with my potential weight. Except I binge sometimes (I recognise my criteria for a binge is not a medical binge! like >!500 calories !<probably).

It's all so fucked. And what makes it worse? Pictures of my friend make it look like she has relapsed. Even if I get to my two-month goal weight (>!145lb!<) I will be at my 'ideal' weight, a healthy weight (the weight which I remember caused a huge spiral of self loathing when I was 16!) and I want to be fucking tiny. But because I am 5'10 and my hands and feet and frame are big, I will always look lumbering and huge. I cry when I look in the mirror, I am dizzy and grumpy, my skin is terrible, and I am not even fucking thin. And even if I get to that weight, I will still be healthy and normal. I want to look gaunt, I want to look like my friend looked when we were on holiday, I want to look like I looked when I was nineteen...

I ate food during the day, in front of other people. I even talked to a friend about my ED. And now, the witch that caused my layoff not only took my livelihood & my benefits away, but robbed me of my recovery gains, too.

I’ve been off my meds about a month and when I went to refill them, there are issues with insurance so I don’t even know when I’ll get them. I’m suddenly back to where I was a year and a half ago. And a big part of me wants to keep letting myself get there. It doesn’t help that the family I’m living with is all weird about food. My boyfriend is really supportive and I’m worried that if I do relapse hard he’ll notice and try to make me eat which would make things very tense for me even though I know it comes from a place of love and care so I’m planning on just eating a small dinner when he’s home and hoping he doesn’t catch on that I haven’t eaten the rest of the day. I just feel like I have no desire to be in recovery anymore. My eating disorder serves me in many ways and I want to let it right now. But I feel bad for having these feelings because I feel like I’m hurting those around me.",1644295307.0

Progressing in Therapy,12,sm9wsx,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/sm9wsx/progressing_in_therapy/,2,"Hello all, I posted here some months ago saying I was able to 'eat regularly' for a week (iirc!) and that was a big deal for me. I wanted to update with good news :) 

Obviously there have been some ups and downs since then, but my weight has been stable for months now. And my therapist has deemed it suitable that we move on from specialised CBT for the ED, to DBT.

The DBT is apparently a natural progression and meant to reduce my vulnerability to ED relapse. As part of that we are doing a lot of ""chain analysis"" of problem behaviours (doesn't have to be ED related, but for example restricting) so I can stop any bad thoughts leading to maladaptive behaviours in its tracks.

I'm just sharing, hopefully this can help others see recovery is possible, even if I can't say I'm fully there yet. 

I have a long way to go and it was a lot of work getting here. I had to stop going on reddit tbh. Also, Disclaimer I had to first sort out my depression which compounded my ED, by fully confronting an interpersonal issue. Once that was out of the way I really felt more able to follow the regular eating and more motivated to succeed.

My therapist said that once I'm at a good place with the dbt and more stable, I can do ptsd therapy, again to reduce my vulnerability to relapse. So I'm looking forward to that :)",1644187423.0
Feel invalid for not being sick “long enough”,24,slotjc,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/slotjc/feel_invalid_for_not_being_sick_long_enough/,11,"Does anyone else struggle to get help or take action toward recovery because they feel like they haven’t been “sick” long enough?

Psilocybin & Self/Body-Image,71,slfv2d,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/slfv2d/psilocybin_selfbodyimage/,10,"I read that researchers are exploring psilocybin as a novel treatment for body dysmorphia, feeding and eating disorders, so I want to share my experience with magic mushrooms and the overall impact this has had on my body image. 

I hope to hear from others who have had experiences (both helpful and unhelpful) with this, as well. 

I recently tried psilocybin for the first time, and I now incorporate it into a sort-of-structured routine of microdosing every few months. 

People always say, “don’t look in the mirror” on psychedelics. But looking in the mirror on mushrooms is the first time I feel I’ve ever truly seen myself — visibly exhausted, sick, and starved from striving to be *enough* of anything, at the request of no one.

This sounds like a negative experience but truly it has been overwhelmingly positive for my self-image. Having had an opportunity to see myself as “enough,” and knowing that this perspective is available to me from time to time, has been very freeing. 

I have always viewed myself as a strong woman, but the person I saw in the mirror a was girl visibly burdened by shame, self-doubt, and fear of losing control. The overwhelming sense of compassion I have toward myself when I see her is so valuable. In my normal life, I have discovered an enhanced ability to offer myself graciousness, patience, and breathing room to explore. This trickles down to how I interact with others who are existing on this planet, as well. 

I looked at my sweet baby cats and my dogs and I saw souls who exist to explore life, who view me as their everything, and who (if they have emotions) probably would be heartbroken to know how much I feel like not enough. 

I realized how much energy I put toward focusing on myself and trying to control things, and how brief my time with my pets will be. And how many opportunities to go on walks and to breathe in their fur and to kiss their face I stand to miss if I don’t recognize my chains from this disorder, or evaluate why they are there, or ask why I am so unwilling to fight them. I can see now that my disorder is not my friend and it will never stop demanding more from me. Life is out there, and it will never tell me the truth about that. 

I am not recovered and I don’t think this will ever be “fixed,” but being able to understand the truth of what this is, at least momentarily, has been so helpful.

"Seriously, I’m so over this",49,skehtd,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/skehtd/seriously_im_so_over_this/,4,"Warning, long winded rant ahead:
I first fell into Anorexia at 14, weight restored, over compensated and relapsed every few years - you know how it goes. Along with this there’s a ton of other mental health issues and chronic suicidality.
In 2020 at 35 I was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer.
(Part of me is always going to wonder if this kicked off due to my ED). Now being told I was going to die actually helped with the suicidal ideation which was a plus but a side effect of the cancer, major surgery, an ileostomy and chemo is pretty dramatic weight loss.
Cue being hellishly triggered. So I dropped to below my old relapse adult GW without even trying which I can’t deny made me giddy with happiness.
Then treatment finished and I was told I was in remission. I was happy. I was thin, feeling better and not suicidal for once.
But of course, with my new found “health” and the fact I hadn’t reached the weight by counting calories or exercising once treatment finished I slowly started piling back on the kilos.
I don’t keep scales in the house and knew I had gained a lot visually and with clothing, I just didn’t know how much.
Recently some of the cancer symptoms came back so 
this morning I had a PET scan to see where things were at.
They weighed me.
I had gained 20kg since I finished chemo 6 months ago. Having resigned myself to the fact the cancer was back and I’d soon lose it again anyway I didn’t have a nervous breakdown on the spot. 
I just got the report from the scan and it says I’m still clear. Still in remission.

I should be over the moon but instead I’ve been sobbing wishing I was dying because now I’m fat. 
I have cancer for fucks sakes. It’s eventually going to come back and kill me, I shouldn’t care one iota what my weight is, I have four children and a loving husband I should focus on spending any time I’ve got left with them and yet all I can think about is being up 20kg and how I’m not physically able to run or even walk far anymore to burn it off.

i think what i worry is that since right now im not struggling too much compared too other times in my ed, that this current phase wasnt improved though engaging or planning too 'recover' in the sense off WG and less disordered behaviour etc do i even still have an ed like is it still there lurking for the opportunity too grip me again. Is possible for it too quieten for periods of time but like once you've got it you'll have it in whatever form until you commit too a full recovery?  i don't plan on staying in this phase, im just waiting until other circumstances push me down the ed spiral again.  i worry was it even that bad throughout all the different cycles ive been in over the last 18 months if im sometimes able too reach this point of less disorderedness ? and reaching a healthier weight by myself.

I've lost enough weight the last few months that my clothes do not fit. Pants won't stay up, shirts sliding off shoulders, etc. 

I'm trying to find sites online to order some new ones. I went to sites I remember liking in the past, as well as basic sites like Target and Amazon.

I feel like most stores right now have one of two styles.

One - SUPER form fitting clothes, shorter shirts, crop tops, or a ton of cleavage. Generally just designed to draw attention to your body and screams, ""Look at me!""

Two - Shapeless, super oversized blouses that hang like  potato sacks.

The thought of wearing something form fitting gives me a literal panic attack. I do not want something that highlights my flaws. I do not want a shirt that will show my stomach if I lift my arms. I really don't want to draw attention to any part of body in any way, shape, or form. 

At the same time, I'm also wanting to look slightly more put together than hiding behind extra baggy oversized shirts (and I'm tired of baggy clothes drawing attention to my weight loss).

So where do you like to shop? What stores do you buy your clothes from? Are there stores that have cute clothes that have something in between, ""I'm a Kardashian,"" and ""I'm an Amish farmer?""

For me, it's also nothing to do with attraction since I feel this way even toward my gay male friends who I have no interest in. I feel a similar urge when I know women who weigh less, however this urge is greater when comparing myself to men because societal expectations for women revolve around being petite/short. 

How does one get over this? My struggle is that while I shouldn't compare myself to others, logically speaking, I am shorter and I am female, so therefore to be a healthy weight I should weigh less and be physically smaller than a man who is taller or anyone for that matter. I don't know how to reconcile this obsession to lose weight because it feels logical to want to lose weight if that makes sense. Can anyone else relate? Anyone have any tips on overcoming this particular comparison?",1643754962.0

I’m already suffering from the consequences of restricting but I self diagnosed myself as a hypochondriac so I just feel as if this is another fake thing that I’ve tricked myself into thinking I am, despite the fact that almost every waking second is spent thinking about food and how I almost pass out throughout the day. I also hate seeking any sort of medical help where I feel I should be honest because they tend to lead me down a road of self doubt and such. Like, I know I’m not underweight, even though I am close and used to be much closer, but please. Don’t do me like that. Don’t make me feel as if it’s some other non issue that is really new when I’ve had this issue for much longer. I want helot but I don’t also?!?

Chronic illness symptoms triggering ED,2,sigvmi,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/sigvmi/chronic_illness_symptoms_triggering_ed/,3,"[TW: numbers, gender dysphoria] 

I’m really struggling here. I’m in the middle of an endometriosis flare that has me SO bloated. I’m talking 5+ lbs and over 2 inches at the waistline basically overnight. It’s been about a week and it’s refusing to calm down no matter what I do. I’m pretty sure a change in medication is what triggered it, so besides trying to manage the side effects, there’s nothing I can really do to “fix” this besides waiting for my system to adjust. 

Rationally, I know that the weight gain is temporary and the result of something beyond my control. But I really just can’t help it - I’m triggered as fuck. I’m in pain, none of my clothes fit, and I feel like a goddamn blimp. My abdomen is so distended that I look pregnant (which is also triggering as hell because I’m non-binary and it sets of my gender dysphoria something awful). I’m wildly swinging between heavy restriction to try to correct how I look and bingeing because it feels hopeless. I just want to hide away from everyone and everything.

Also two of my coworkers saw me coming into work the other day still in workout clothes, including bike shorts, and the fact that I was perceived while dressed like that with my legs and body showing is killing me!!!!!

I truly have so much anxiety about the kitchen. I could easily binge an entire cookie box and I would if it were in my own kitchen. I’m trying to avoid it but I generally have a few pieces per day but I’m sooo terrified people will notice I’m eating too much of the shared candy.

Feeling lonely,18,sgp6nu,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/sgp6nu/feeling_lonely/,6,"I started losing weight again super quickly after breaking up with my BF of 6 years last July. 
He cheated on me with a girl I’d always been jealous of how skinny she was. In both of my LTRs I tended to binge and gain weight over the years, only to then get left for someone smaller than me when I become overweight. Funnily enough, I weighed the exact same amount at each break up, down to the pound. 

I’m trying to not read into that but my ED has really latched on to the idea that I would have been more lovable if I had been smaller.  ‘Being hotter’ than the girl I was left for is a giant trigger thought. It’s almost like I want him to see how small I’ve gotten and what, be worried about me? Want me back? 
I wouldn’t date him again even if he did. 

I just find I can’t stop… I don’t want to meet new people, I don’t want to think about love, I just want to stay alone in my room and not be bothered to eat.

I am 26 now. I moved away from my abusive home that promoted obesity as Fun and “Fuck it why not” mentality. 


To be completely blunt with you…I don’t want to change. On one hand, of fucking course I do or I wouldn’t be posting this, pleading for help… But… I’ve been this weight and had this routine for So long.. It’s frighteningly daunting to change. I don’t even believe my body is capable of shedding a single pound. 


The sound of exercise is horrifying with how bad my body hurts even walking, and how bad my asthma is. I can’t do much before my lungs are completely on fire and I’m in tears. 


I work full time at a semi active job, because my previous more active job had my back constantly seizing up and making lasting injuries just trying to clean hotel rooms. And even this job is painful for me and i’ve been looking for sedentary jobs that stop hurting me so much… 

When I get home, I have only a few hours before I need to go to sleep for work. So I…as much as I hate to admit, refuse to waste any of that time exercising. I want to enjoy my life, doing things indoors. Knowing my weight, I only have so much time left to enjoy anyways and I have art commissions for my side hustle to do digitally. 


Until I am able to have my own place to live, I am stuck with my boyfriend’s parents who honestly spike my c-ptsd since his mom isn’t much different than mine. So I don’t leave the room. I don’t cook meals unless everyone in the house is asleep and it’s a quiet meal. But lord knows if I will bother to “cook meals” in my own place either. 


I lack self restraint/control, I can’t bring it up in therapy because we are focusing on reprocessing so many different traumatic situations, we don’t have time for stupid food talk. 


I have a nutritionist prescribed to me and even though she 100% understands my current situation…she wasn’t even sure how to help. She said she wouldn’t tell me “don’t eat this.”, but rather “eat smaller portions of this.” which is completely fair. 


But I am fucking hungry. I cannot focus on anything as my ravenous brain IMMEDIATELY starts seeking food until I am Literally about to vomit from being so full. It’s never satisfied. 

I am trying to get officially diagnosed, in August, Again with Adhd since I know my old meds used to suppress these food seeking desires… but right now I just can’t stand to be alive. Having to hide under layers of clothes, be embarrassed by how much space I take up everywhere, how when I walk into fast food, people don’t seem shocked at all that someone like me is there. 


I don’t know what to do… Something that won’t make me hurt; wont make me breathless; wont make me physically shake from hunger despite having just ate a full meal; yet is magically easy and simple to do…

I blame myself entirely. I really do. My mom promoted over eating, but it was my fault I didn’t restrain myself.. It’s my fault I am such a toddler, pouting about hating exercise (I can walk but it hurts my back that I can’t do it for too many miles..) and having to physically do any work when all I want is the damn meds to fucking stop me from feeling hunger…

I finally snapped and told her that was uncalled for, and asked her why she felt the need to comment on my food.

I realized I was losing weight pretty rapidly, one pound a day. I was getting addicted to the feeling of seeing the number on the scale drop everyday with such little effort. This high went on for five consecutive days of effortless weight loss until it all come to, what felt like, a screeching halt. I stepped on the scale and found I weighed the same as the day before. This triggered my ED brain big time. I started restricting myself to one meal a day. I restricted for two days with little success in losing. That’s when the binge urges came full swing. It was horrible. I began snacking a couple times a day, and even though I knew it wasn’t a binge I’d felt like it was. So much anxiety and emotional turmoil. I knew I was starting to slip into a binge-restrict cycle. I’ve gotten pretty good at having enough self awareness to realize these things. I took a good, hard look at myself and decided to nurture my inner child. I decided to wasn’t going to let myself be overcome by this toxic cycle. I stopped weighing myself and let myself eat normal meals. 

It’s difficult finding a balance while losing weight after recovering from an eating disorder. I keep telling myself there are healthy methods to lose weight, they just take patience. Patience is something I know a lot of us ED’ers struggle with. We’re so used to losing weight in unhealthy, damaging, and quick ways that when we learn the healthy 1lb a week way it’s almost laughable to imagine not racing to the finish line. 
But, I’m back on track. Not pushing overly healthy food 100% of the time, but not eating terribly and trying to make healthier, more fulfilling choices.

Now, my boyfriend likes my body. When we first met he even said it was ideal. Even now, he says he probably wouldn’t have noticed ifI hadn’t told him but now I’ve gained weight I feel incredibly gross. 

I know he means the best, but he has said “I like that you have a little more meat on your bones” which, obviously, I don’t want to hear. As he says, he’s “got a sickness for the thickness.” Not in a bad way I guess, he’s said that if he thought I was getting unhealthy overweight he’d tell me. 

Looking back at photos of myself in June, I have incredible cheekbones. I miss them haha. I miss being at the lowest weight I’ve ever been since I stopped getting taller. I miss the way my legs looked and I’m so insecure about my belly and upper arms. 

Obviously, back then I didn’t see a change. But now I do. And I miss it. I’m trying to work out more and all. I don’t know. 

He made me promise not to start skipping meals again. And promises mean a lot to him. I know he’d be so disappointed in me. 

That’s pretty much it. I just feel gross.",1643322804.0

Does anybody experience period symptoms but not actually menstruate?,9,sdlcw3,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/sdlcw3/does_anybody_experience_period_symptoms_but_not/,1,"Hey, so I hope this isn't TMI but for any ladies on here I'm wondering if anybody else experiences this and what the heck is going on! My doctor's are not super well-versed in the reproductive side of ED's and I haven't needed any gynecological care since I'm not having sex atm. So basically, I'm 22 and female. Had my period for less than a year between the ages of twelve and thirteen when I developed my ED. I have Anorexia Nervosa and lost my period very quickly as I was already naturally underweight when my disorder developed so it ended up going away completely very early on. I did not experience any period for multiple years, and at one point after treatment, I had a period come back with very light bleeding for a very short time (less than six months) before relapsing so it was completely irregular. Basically this means, that I have never experienced a regularly occurring period. At this point, my BMI has been severely underweight for a number of years but I remember having some bleeding at a still slightly underweight BMI for my height, I have gotten a period at around 90-95 pounds and am 5'4. I have maintained a weight of under 75 lbs for well over a year at this point but have noticed that every couple of weeks I experience hormonal symptoms but with zero bleeding. For example, I never have any and every couple of weeks I get a terrible breakout, stomach cramping, I gain between 3 and 6 pounds overnight, headaches, pretty much all the PMS symptoms. I decided to begin tracking when this was occurring and have realized that it happens every 26 days or so, and the symptoms last for about five days. Also constipation. It feels eerily similar to a period, minus the bleeding. Does this mean my body still produces the necessary hormones but there's just no eggs? Has anyone experienced anything similar?

Struggling.,59,sd7pt6,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/sd7pt6/struggling/,31,"I’m 29. Married with 2 kids. My husband and I have had some up and downs but it’s by far mostly been good. The past few weeks have especially felt good. I’ve been back on track losing weight (mostly) healthily. It’s needed weight loss after baby #2. My husband and I have been very connected lately and feeling extra in love. We’re planning a big move and planning on a future baby #3. And we’ve been looking forward to a child-free long weekend in a few weeks. Like have been planning this and looking forward to needed alone time for months. 

I feel so stupid that this is bothering me, but my laptop was being buggy yesterday so I had my husband poke around on it and reset a few things. I don’t know how, but the search history from sometime last year popped up, from the last time he borrowed my laptop. He apparently had been searching for a specific girls nudes. Specifically looking for her onlyfans account. Some influencer. 

This girl is much younger and MUCH skinnier than me. And at the time of the searches, I would’ve been in the thick of trying to lose the baby weight. My brain can’t stop making comparisons. I keep finding myself looking for reasons why. We’ve had some intimacy issues in the past because his sex drive isn’t as high as mine. I feel like now I know why. We’ve been doing so good. *I’ve* been doing so good. Now I feel shattered and embarrassed. 

I reacted very negatively. Obviously. And I’m embarrassed by that and it just makes me feel worse. On top of the fact that my husband would rather look for some younger girls nudes than have sex with me. Not to mention the fact that I found nudes that I sent him right around the same time. How embarrassing. 

I’m sorry. I’m spiraling. Not really looking for advice. But my two best friends are my husband and his sister so it’s not like I can vent to them about this.

 
Update: A few weeks ago we had a heart to heart about how I’d been feeling emotionally and sexually neglected. I had tried to initiate sex, and he shot me down in a flippant way. I guess it was obvious that I was hurt so we ended up having a really good conversation. The following few weeks have been amazing with my husband, feeling crazy in love and connected and communicating a lot more. I’ve been feeling happy and confident, he’s been happy and we’ve been making big plans for our future. 

Then this happened and I feel like everything I was feeling before was just validated. So that’s where a lot of this is coming from. We had another talk this morning. He apologized and said he wants to work on reconnecting again. 

Now we all have to go get tested for COVID because our oldest spiked a fever and my MIL said she tested positive for COVID after visiting us last week, so that’s cool.

I feel so stupid being upset about it so many years later but I just can't believe I never made the connection.

Towards the end of primary school/beginning of junior high, I developed really severe food allergies and had to go on a VERY restrictive diet that resulted in me losing a lot of weight. It was an extremely stressful time for my family, and I almost died no less than three times over the course of about two years due to mistakes with foods. I remember being really frustrated with how my body had failed me, and developing a lot of anxiety about food in general.

In the midst of struggling with this and trying to adapt, all the kids around me were honestly terrible. I never really comprehended it at the time, but looking back, it's no wonder things got bad later. I was constantly made a spectacle of for having to eat different foods, was asked invasive questions, was accused of doing it for attention, had rumors spread around that I was anorexic (which is ironic now, considering that I have a restrictive ED lmao). It was around this time that I remember beginning to hate my body's appearance, as well as actively dreading and avoiding social situations that involved food.

It just makes me so fucking pissed to think about. Like I was already struggling so badly at that time, feeling like everything in my life was out of control, and everyone had to get up in my business and make my life that much harder. All of those kids were shit, and the adults that enabled them and didn't stop them are even worse. 

Anyways. I know that being angry about it won't change anything. But over a decade of ED later and in the midst of my worst relapse to date with no end in sight, I can't help it.

I’m (26F) just so done right now. really don’t know who to talk to and just need to get this out.,23,s8bvzp,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/s8bvzp/im_26f_just_so_done_right_now_really_dont_know/,4,"today my partner (27M) and i went through our apartment getting rid of stuff to give to goodwill, throwing stuff away, rearranging things and what not. as i was cleaning out my beside table, i came across my old phone. i heard a warning voice in my head saying, “probably best you don’t go through those photos.” i knew it was right given how critical i am of myself, but i couldn’t resist. i charged it and went through my photos. sure enough, i immediately find photos of me from 1-2 years ago, and had the same experience i’ve had every single time i have done this in the past. 

i feel instant shame, regret, dread, a sad kind of nostalgia that doesn’t even make sense. i feel so cursed by this disorder. i feel fucking ridiculous every time i see older photos and think, “wow you were way thinner then compared to now, and you were still miserable about how you thought you looked. so sad, you should have embraced it cuz you look like shit now.” the existential dread i feel by “wasting” my youngest years i’ll ever have hating how i look is so intense. one of my biggest fears is feeling this way for the rest of my life; becoming an old woman wishing i could have just seen that everything was fucking fine and that i was beautiful the way i was. that all my misery was my own fault, and if i could have just finally broke through this disgusting fog of self loathing everything would have been warm and happy like 1970s film. but i was in my own way, and i couldn’t do it. 

the amount of suffering i still feel, while trying to recover feels almost worse if not exactly the same as how i felt at my absolute sickest. my relationship with my body, and food is still so fucked and it’s so hard not to just give up and accept that this is going to stay with me for the rest of my life. that sometimes it’s just “not in the cards” for some people to get better and feel self love no matter how hard they try physically and mentally. if anything, sometimes i feel like my relationship with both is even worse than when it all started but i don’t know. it’s all a blur since it’s been going on for so long. before i even knew i had a problem (but that’s another story lmao)

i don’t know. i feel so fucking alone sometimes, and defiantly all alone within my eating disorder that i barely ever even talk about to literally anyone. don’t even get me started on continuously growing out of my clothes every year and then not being able to afford new ones lmao

I really don't understand how I can possibly recover when three normal meals are already more than the calories I should eat in a day,141,s7mqhk,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/s7mqhk/i_really_dont_understand_how_i_can_possibly/,33,"I don't even have room for snacks and I don't understand how others can.

I'm at a point in my life where I'm REALLY ready to leave my ED behind. You know when you really start thinking ""I'm SO done with this""? Yeah, that's the point I'm at. But the fear of gaining weight is just so strong. Before my ED, I used to maintain a normal BMI effortlessly; my hunger cues were on point, and I had no notion about calories at all. 

But now, looking back, I know I used to eat meals that right now would feel restrictive, because back then my hunger cues were actually those of a normal fucking person. I'm at my pre ED weight right now, so it's not like I need to gain weight, but I'm still hungry all the time and I'm still thinking about food all the time. I eat three meals a day that amount to pretty much what I need to eat on a daily basis, and in fact I'm not losing weight. But it literally just feels like in my deepest relapses, just at a higher weight. 

If I want a snack, I need to reduce one of the meals in order to make room for it. If I have a higher calorie dinner, my body won't just compensate automatically by making me less hungry the next day; I'll have to consciously reduce my portions. I cannot have desserts unless I cut something out of other meals. Right now I just had breakfast - a solid, substantial breakfast with all the necessary nutrients - and I'm HUNGRIER than before. Why bother having meals at all then?

It's incredibly frustrating. I will never recover with these meals. Ever. I will have to restrict and think about food for the rest of my freaking life. And I don't want that but I also don't know the alternative, except gaining weight forever.

Obviously dietitians and therapists don't help, in fact they never did. Always stating that these meals should satiate me so it's obviously all MeNtAl. 

Which is why I'm starting to slowly realize that I will never recover. And it's so depressing because it's not like I need my ED or anything. I don't need it, I don't want it, it doesn't make me happy, it doesn't help me, if I could just trust my body and eat whatever I want without thinking about it (like I used to do before the onset of the illness) I would recover right now. Many people say they'll never recover because they cannot let go of their coping mechanism, or control or whatever, but I can. It's not about that, for me.

But I still can't recover. I'm broken. My hunger cues are broken and I'll never be able to fix them. And honestly, I'm not sure that I'll able to live this life much longer. People don't realize just how horrible and life consuming thinking about food all the time is.",1642586269.0

However, they follow the 12 steps, similar to AA, and I find those steps to be a little counterintuitive to eating disorder recovery. There seems to be a lot of blaming the ED sufferer. For example:

Step 4: Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

Step 5: Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

Step 6: We're entirely ready to have God remove all these **defects of character**.

Step 7: Humbly asked God to remove our **shortcomings**.

Like, yes, I get it, those with EDs sometimes harm others, and it's not necessarily an issue of morality -- it's a mental illness. 

Also, as someone who already feels morally defective due to religious trauma, it just hurts even more. I'm also staying away from talk about god because of that, and AA / EDA groups focus a lot on a ""higher power,"" and I realize that higher power can be anything (not just a religion) but it still rubs me the wrong way, personally. (Not hating on religion!!) And the religious trauma was something I worked through in ED treatment. 

Idk, does anyone else feel this way? I understand EDA might just not be my thing, and I know it's beneficial for others. I'm just wondering if there's others who feel similarly. I also want to know if I'm missing something? Like is my ED a character defect? I don't think so, but...? Idk I'm confused lol.

this is my first ever reddit post- Mods I hope I’ve added correct TW. apologies in advance it is long but I need to get this out haha

Last year during a 4 month heavy lockdown where I live, I relapsed after a 10yr long period of recovery. My recovery was a very gradual thing that happened over the 10 years, and was never a targeted attempt- life happened and I developed a better relationship with food/ myself etc. Then in July 2021 the lockdown happened, I was isolated, anxious and with nothing else to distract myself- started fixating on being “healthier” which is how my relapse began. It was also a gradual thing- and by the time I realised I’d relapsed- I was too far gone.

I’ve lost a significant amount of weight, which is what I thought I wanted. I wanted people to notice, comment etc. I thought if I got my body to a certain point it would fix everything. Now I’m here, I’ve gotten what I wanted- people notice, make comments- I’m ✨skinni✨. And I kind of hate it. I’ve lost all my curves and I miss them. I feel childlike and it makes me uncomfortable when men try to compliment my skinny body. Which is surprising as I thought this is what I wanted. What is unsurprising is that it has fixed none of the issues I thought it would- only exacerbated them.

I’ve been trying (and failing) to up my calorie intake recently- and have been eating between 700-900 calories most days with some  higher calorie days. I find it relatively easy to eat “normally” on occasion, for example when I was on vacation a few weeks ago. I told myself that I would continue once I got home. Now that I’m back I just cannot break the habit of eating my safe foods and sticking to my old food rituals. It’s like I want to gain weight in theory but I just cannot break the habit of under eating when I’m in my day to day life. I’m scared of how the weight is going to distribute if I do gain. I just want my ass and boobs back. But I also want to be skinny. It’s just so conflicting and I don’t know how to get past it.

Ive been toying with the idea of recovery and I think I’m ready to slowly start introducing some healthier habits into my life, growing some muscle and to be stronger/ have more energy- but I’m not ready to go back to therapy (the hospital and allied health services in my country are seriously failing right now due to a huge Covid outbreak so I’d rather not add to the strain). 

If anyone has any advice for self- recovery and/or recommendations for good recovery resources- eg books, podcasts, YouTubers etc I’d really appreciate them!

if you will. try and improve myself and my life and engage and try at life again. ive felt like this for a little while but am still scared too lean into the idea and really give 'recovery' or something like it a proper go. all ive been doing since xmas is trying too restrict and 'failing'. 
my mind feels split af. im changing my mind from one extreme too the next. for instance i just spent two hours researching what would be an extremely restrictive diet and planning how ill start it too all of a sudden thinking maybe *big big maybe* im kinda sorta ready too recover ? 

 i dont feel at this particular moment im using restriction too numb my emotions or as a choping mechanism- i think right now my main reason for continuing restriction and clinging too my ed is so that i can reach my lower weight and then feel 'readier' too recover. as it will also  be more physical. since also im eating around maintence daily even tbkigh i attempt too eat xxx and fail. its like my body is just rejecting restriction again. but im still being vegan??? 

idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best",1641953918.0

youll feel too much"" and ofc AN came up as a top result.

The body image issues and disordered eating began a couple of decades ago, but it was just after my 14th birthday that it changed completely. I can pinpoint it, I remember the distinction, the shift, nothing would ever be the same. When I was a teenager, I never thought this would be my life. My school caught on first and contacted my parents by the end of March. I was in therapy for the first time in early April. I am one of the ones who was supposed to recover fully and quickly. I should not be sitting here 13 years later with chronic anorexia. My specialist psychiatrist's goal BMI for me is now 16.5 because they know I will not be able to maintain higher, and ""at least"" I would be medically safer. I cannot even reach that. 

Early last year, I looked worse than I do now - it was in my face. I believe it is a combination of cosmetic injections, changed skincare, and my body simply adapting. However, my body does not match this. My body looks young and it looks unwell. I have had way too many encounters with older men who have made clear how attracted to me they are - that they think I am beautiful, and they love my body, my size, my bones, how young my body looks. I am disgusted with myself and I am ashamed of myself for being this age and looking the way I do. And I am about to be another year older, in the same position. I should not look like this. I hate what they say. 

I have been maintaining things for a long time, in the sense that my weight has remained in a 2kg range for almost a year, and I have been eating a decent amount. I am still very underweight, but I stopped losing. I do not know how much longer I can do this. I just want to destroy myself - it is like, the self hatred and the shame and the self loathing for being this way after 13 years just makes me want to use the same disease to punish myself further. Reach a new low. See how far I can go. 

At the same time, I cannot imagine living another 13 years with this illness, because it will not be the same as the last 13 years. In the last 18 months, things have reached a point unlike ever before and this is not the same illness I was dealing with in the past, mentally or physically. All that seems possible is staying where I am, getting worse, or eventually death. I cannot gain weight, there is so much failure in that for me because I am supposed to be underweight. I cannot lose the control over my weight or calories. I have had those things for 13 years. I cannot give them up, these things inherent to my existence. 

I have never felt so hopeless before. While I do not know what I expected when I was younger, I know I did not think that 13 years later I would have chronic AN :(",1641705573.0

And then there's me, who every time that tries recovery ends up eating ALL THE FOOD ALL THE TIME and gains so much weight. I've been in recovery since Christmas, making use of the holidays to allow myself to eat more, and I told myself that I would follow a 3 meals 3 snacks meal plan BUT also give myself permission to eat more snacks if I wanted them...but I just eat all the time instead. I wanted to gain weight slowly but I gained so much it's almost unbelievable.

I met the criteria for clinically severe Anorexia on the 24th of December, and now I'm weight restored. I went from severely underweight to normal BMI in 2 weeks. It's like every time I try recovery and try a normal meal plan my body takes over and goes ""lol no, you're gonna eat all the food and you're gonna do it NOW"". I'll have a normal breakfast and then just a couple hours later I'll be raiding the pantry. Like today I had a very substantial breakfast with scrambled eggs on buttered toast and a piece of fruit, yet less than 1 hour later I went back and had loads of chocolate, more fruit, ham, a few pieces of candy, some bread with pb, and even had some butter plain. Now I've eaten more than my meal plan for the day, and it's not even lunchtime - my brain is now screaming at me to skip lunch and/or purge but I cannot bring myself to do either of these things.

I'm trying my best to avoid freaking out and to convince myself that it's not a binge and it's okay and I can still eat my meals and carry on with my day...but it's so hard when the only thing you see is you're packing on the pounds and just spend your whole day eating and eating and eating.

Plus, as an adult, eating like a person with Anorexia is embarrassing enough, but eating like a 15 year old highly active male teenager is even worse. I just want it to be over already.


I feel like a complete pig and I've stopped following recovery material because all those people who recover ""the right way"" trigger me so much.

My history with ED is something I've kept a secret to a lot of people in my life, including some of my best friends. To be honest, being at my age (26) and still struggling with image and my ED makes me very ashamed. It's embarrassing to cry over food, restrict, binge, exercise excessively, and lose and gain the same 10 pounds over and over. I don't *look* like someone who has struggled with anorexia - maybe a little on the smaller side, but not clinically underweight. 

But I'm not over chasing the dragon, not yet. I keep thinking I can live the life I want and maintain the weight I want. I know this is taboo and unhealthy to say out loud, but I just want to be honest about it somewhere. I don't know if I want to give up my ED.

My friend has just invited me to take boudoir photos with them, and this isn't the first time someone has asked me about this. I love the idea of a boudoir photoshoot, I love fashion and lingerie and body positivity, but it scares the absolute shit out of me. I have a very difficult relationship with my image and body. I hate any and all photographs. It took so much nerve to do my damn engagement photo shoots. In a perfect world, I'd take some sexy pictures and boom, I'd feel great about myself, but I doubt that will happen. 

I love that people freely express themselves and their sexuality, and I think that's important. But I feel so infantile and stupid for being so hung up on my body and am worried people judge me for my insecurity. Maybe I'm not expressing this the most eloquent or PC way, so I hope this is not triggering to read. 

How do you guys handle photos, have you ever done boudoir photos, and what do you think about this?",1641415529.0
When to consider medication?,11,rwtt7d,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/rwtt7d/when_to_consider_medication/,18,"This isn't 100% about my eating disorder, but it's related. I've been working on recovery the last 3 years and I've made a lot of progress, but I also feel like that has revealed how my problems go deeper than my ED.

I don't know how to explain it exactly, but basically I'm a pretty intense person. I have intense emotions, usually in phases of 2-4 days, sometimes longer or shorter. If nothing's holding me back, I'll keep myself busy to the point of exhaustion which kinda makes me feel better, but isn't sustainable. I used to think this was linked to my ED, but now I don't care as much about weight/food and the rest is still there.

What's making me want to seek help is, the effect on my relationship. I try to be a good partner, but I know my emotions still come through and I can be difficult. Sometimes I lose perspective, which leads to fights. My coping mechanisms (ED, staying super busy) aren't good for the relationship obviously, which I can control but it's always a battle.

Previously, I was on medication on-and-off for several years (citalopram aka celexa). It definitely leveled me out and actually helped address my ED symptoms a LOT. But it also made me sluggish and tired all the time, basically sedated. I didn't feel like myself. I was mostly just sleeping when I should have been exploring life and making friendships. I know that's not the only option and the dose can also be adjusted, but I'm scared of going through that again. Last time I tried it, I remember having thoughts like ""Fuck it, life is intense, I'm an intense person, and it's okay to live an intense life.""

I saw a therapist for six months recently, I came to her wanting to talk about other things but we wound up talking about my mood symptoms too. She said I showed some signs of a possible mood disorder but it wasn't 100% clear, and recommended I bring this up with my doctor if I ever get concerned in the future. So I guess I'm concerned. But also scared to ask my doctor because I don't know what will happen.

IDK, I know this isn't exactly the right place for this but don't know who else to ask. How have y'all thought about medication, whether to try it or not, how to navigate the process?",1641408063.0

I have no memory in life of not putting the ideal of thinness before anything else. Nothing I've ever accomplished in my life has felt as good as stepping on the scale and seeing a lower number than the day before, or fitting into a smaller size jeans than the year before, or seeing a  bone jutting that I never had before. No orgasm I've ever been given has felt as good as having a man compliment ""my cute little butt"" or fondling my hip bones in bed. It's fucked up. It's *so* fucked up. I want freedom so badly it hurts, but not as badly as I want my Body of Dreams, which is **perpetually** 15 lbs away. I've gained and lost that same 15 lbs hundreds of times in the last 20 years. It's the same carrot on a stick I've been binging and purging my entire life.

You hear about celebrities and models that come out and talk about how they recovered from an eating disorder and how much healthier they are now, but they're still never larger than a size 4-6. Is it possible to really have it all? To be free from the obsession of weight AND still get the body you want? I want recovery. I want a family someday. But I don't see myself ever being happy with a body larger than my own, and I just don't see either of those accomplishments being reached without my body growing and changing in terrifying ways that I have no control over.

Binge/restrict cycle makes me eat ABSURDLY large/gross amounts of fatty condiments. Please help.,2,ruottj,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/ruottj/bingerestrict_cycle_makes_me_eat_absurdly/,5,"
I’ve been on a restrict/binge cycle for years. I’ll eat a very little amount for days then gorge myself for a couple days after my restriction period comes to an end. For some reason, however, when I DO binge, I always feel the need to add DISGUSTING (and I mean truly disgusting) amounts of high caloric/high fat “ingredients” to whatever I’m preparing. 
For example, say it’s a day I decide I am eating whatever tf I want. I will go to McDonald’s and order burgers/junior chickens. I will then ask for extra mayonnaise with said items. I will THEN add my own mayo (yes I’ll bring a mayo container with me in my car) and add EVEN MORE plus I’ll even add extra salt/hell I’ve even brought extra Kraft single slices with me to add to my food. Another example. I was making spaghetti for dinner tonight (I’ve been restricting for three days prior to today) and I was trying to make it a normal spaghetti recipe. But for whatever reason I compulsively added a HUGE slab of butter to the pasta sauce. Also a week ago I had tacos for dinner and added more sour cream/cheese than the taco shell could hold and I still didn’t think it was enough. My boyfriend thinks I’m disgusting (it is though, the amount of fatty toppings I add to food don’t even make sense) WHY am I like this? My parents cooked yummy, healthy (ish) dinners growing up all my life. Why don’t feel this weird compulsion to make any food that I eat on my “binge” days soooooo much more unhealthy than they need to be? The things I do to my food DONT EVEN IMPROVE THE TASTE. they make it worse. But it’s as if I crave fat/salt to the extent that even those on “my 600 pound life” would probably think I’m weird. Whenever I eat food that someone else prepares for me (homemade, something I don’t eat often at a restaurant, etc) I always try to remind myself how good it tastes and why I don’t need to add absurd amounts of butter/oil/mayo/salt to every thing I eat when I’m binging. The only reason I’m not morbidly obese/super unhealthy is because of how much restriction I do in between these binge periods. Does anyone relate to this?


Edit*

More examples from the top of my head:

Making sandwiches for my boyfriend and myself. I will make his normally and make mine with 3x the amount of butter/mayo than his (it’s disgusting. I literally don’t even like how it tastes this way.) and I’ll be super secretive about it.  (Wtf!)

Any time I follow a recipe, if it calls for oil/butter I will automatically add at least double the recommended amount. (Same with salt)

I’ll add butter to foods that don’t even require it what so ever. (Any kind of soup, ramen/instant noodles, literally anything) and will seriously not eat it if I don’t have something fatty to sneak in. 

One time I wanted to get a sub from Subway. I then didn’t end up getting it because I realized I was out of mayo at home and didn’t want to embarrass myself with asking for 4x the normal amount of mayo. Embarrassing. I know. I had a bite of my boyfriends regularly made sub the other day and it was SOO GOOD. Better than any sub I ever order. SO WHY AM I DOING THIS???",1641172153.0

halve way thru eating i realised there was some mould on the bread, and my first thought was at least this could get me sick and i could loose weight. mate what. its crazy how easy these thoughts can slip back in after even accidentally restricting or when you don't even realise you've been slipping back. not sure where i stand with my ed at all anymore or if i have one rn. i guess it never rly goes away, i just want help so i can feel validated but dont actually want too get better :(

I work in a retail setting where I get to know people well, and people keep giving me cookies this season. Giving cookies to a bulimic is kind of like giving alcohol to an alcoholic. I keep trying to reset myself and keep failing.

The photos were only taken 2 years ago and I haven't changed that much but I do think I look older because of my weight now. Although I am sure the stress of the past two years has done something, but I guess I just hope I don't look like I have aged that much, but as someone who is into skincare and I do care about looking younger (as much as I wish I didn't care and as much as I wish I could emotionally align with my rational perspective on agism in society I am just not there yet) It just really bit me... and I just really want to lose the weight again. 

But sometimes it feels like I don't have the drive to run for hours each day and I after gaining the weight I have found other ways to hate myself that fulfill my need for self-destruction... and I kind of wish I didn't even try to recover.

I have Anorexia Nervosa, about ten years and I am twenty-two. I am very underweight but normally can eat a good amount and maintain it. Lately not so much though. 

Lately, most foods have been sounding very unappetizing and disgusting- even foods that I really enjoy. I feel very hungry, yet too weak physically to keep a lot of food down. I feel full so quickly than immediately feel exhausted right after, and even when hungry, so many foods and smells seem so unappetizing. 

For example, I've recently ONLY been craving fatty cuts of meats like red meat, fried meats, or starches with a lot of fat like mashed potatoes or pasta. Textures have been very nauseating unless very, very fatty or very crispy. The smell of food lingering makes me so sick that I sometimes throw up. And every-time I eat I feel like I can just lay in bed and nap. I try to stay very hydrated with Gatorade Zeroes and Pellegrino water all day. 

I wake up very late in the day and basically am always fatigued. The loss of appetite is very frustrating. Nothing satisfies me literally besides very salty, fatty meat. Otherwise, I feel unsatisfied which is so unrealistic and exhausting. I do not know what to do or what is wrong with me- let alone if anyone else experiences this.

A long rant about health problems and dietary restrictions and social isolation,15,rofly8,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/rofly8/a_long_rant_about_health_problems_and_dietary/,2,"CW: a few specifics about dietary restrictions (for medical reasons), mention of weight loss (no numbers)

Sorry in advance that this is a pretty long read. I don't even know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but I figured some of you might be able to relate.

I am on the Low-FODMAP diet, which is a super rigid, restrictive, seemingly nonsensical diet. I'm not on it by choice -- back in June my doctor and dietitian (who don't specialize in treating ED patients) advised me to start it because my IBS symptoms were out of control and running my life. I also have gastroparesis, but I don't think this diet does anything for that (there are a few similarities to the GP diet, but they function in different ways to minimize symptoms). 

Breaking the diet and eating even a small amount of one of the ""oh-no-nos"" can render me bed-bound, or stuck on the toilet, or both, for days. When I first started the diet, I was doing pretty good with my Ed -- I was almost done with PHP for depression, which was super helpful, and my team also knew to check in occasionally about my Ed. My weight was healthy and stable, and with 8 weeks of PHP under my belt, I felt like the veil of depression was finally starting to lift.

Within a month, I unintentionally lost xx lbs because of the restrictive nature and complexity of the diet. All of my disordered eating thoughts, and many of my old behaviors, came back. Because I was sick a lot of the time, and on medical leave from work, it was easy to isolate myself/fuel my Ed. I live with my SO, but he's pretty oblivious. Eventually, when I started showing signs of malnutrition, I told him how much weight I had lost, and he said he honestly hadn't noticed..I mean come on guy, I have body dysmorphia and even *I* could look in the mirror and see the changes in my appearance.

Somehow I managed to keep this shit up until around November, when my SO said that if I didn't get help (for this and depression, which didn't take long to come back), he might end our relationship. So I've been on the wait list for an IP/res program for 8+weeks now...but I had to change insurance when I got fired from my job, and there is a big chance they won't accept out of state Medicaid (haven't been able to talk to the program coordinator about this yet).

So there's the back story...now here comes A Christmas Story:

I went to a good old fashioned Friendsmas on Thursday. I brought my own little boring ass dish for myself, but naturally, other friends brought food that actually looked good. I quizzed a couple of my friends about ingredients, and had a *small* amount of spicy potato curry, even though I know it was made with onion and garlic (major oh-no-nos). Like my SO said, ""a small amount won't kill ya""...right? 

Woke up the next morning feeling really nauseous. My friend, the host, was making pancakes and offered me one. I thought it might help with the nausea if I ate one dry, so I ate half a pancake before I realized ""oh shit I can't eat these"" (gluten and dairy). And then I realized the beer we had been drinking the night before was infused with grapefruit (another oh-no-no). Don't even get me started on beer -- I'm not supposed to have any, but I've always just said fuck it and drank it anyways, and only have issues if I really overdo it.

I drove home and spent the afternoon filling our toilet with ass piss. I wasn't able to spend Christmas Eve with my SO and his stepdad like we had planned. I spent my evening surfing Reddit and binge-watching Shrill.

I am still sick today, so I had to call my parents and tell them I won't be coming to Christmas at their house. They were pissed, because I knowingly consumed things that have the potential to make me sick, *and* they made an entire Christmas meal that caters to my ridiculous dietary restrictions. I'm very sad I won't get to see them, but even more so my nephew and his parents -- due to my SIL being very pregnant, covid, and all my health issues, it's been months since I saw them last. 

After I hung up the phone with them I called my SO and just cried for a while about how much I hate my body, and this diet, and how my stomach issues have made my world so small over the past year. He was sympathetic I guess, until I asked him what time he's coming home later. He said that he's not, he's staying at his mom's house. She only lives 20 minutes away. He used the excuse of having to work tomorrow, but I'm 100% sure he's just crashing there because he's gonna be up late getting wine-drunk with his mom.

I quickly ended the call because I knew I was about to snap off and say something mean. Sooo instead of saying it to his face, I texted him, like a mature, grown-ass adult! It was nothing attacking his character or him as a person (re: not really that mean)...basically, I accused him of not giving a shit that I'm spending the entirety of Christmas alone. He texted back ""what the fuck? You knew this was my plan"" (no I did not actually), and that's it. No acknowledgement of my frustration, my loneliness...actually caring about seeing him (and my family too obviously) for Christmas.

I want to be done. I don't want to be on this diet anymore...I don't want to go to treatment again after 8 years of staying healthy enough not to need it...I don't want my life to be dictated by digestive issues...I don't want my SO to just flippantly write me off as acting crazy whenever I bring up something that is bothering me (usually I'm more mature than today). I don't want to be manipulated by him to go to treatment...everything about our relationship is always on his terms.

Anyway, I'm sorry this got so long, I just had to get it out somewhere. It kind of jumps all over the place, but long story short: my eating disorder and crippling depression are back. Combine those two things with my chronic digestive issues and little to no social support, and I don't know how much longer I'll last.

Merry Christmas, everyone...I hope you are doing whatever makes you happy today

My two main treatment options, since my bmi will be too low soon for CFD, and Alsana seems sus because of cover ups and very odd reviews, are ERC denver and Laureate. However, they have a rly bit difference in the wait times, and I’m consistently losing weight. Denver is 2-3weeks from 3 days ago, and Laureate is 6 weeks. 

Laureate is way smaller so therefore more personalized, which I think is better for me because I am sensitive (might have ASD) and kind of picky with food, like meat fat and milk and mushrooms and asparagus and citrus desserts. However, if the waitlist is actually 6 weeks long I feel like it would take a really long time to recover from that point because I’ve been low restricting/fasting for a bit now.

I’ve heard some good things of ERC Denver pine, since it is less triggering than Willow, and because Denver is a hub for medicine. However, I’ve also heard that staff can be abusive and it can be like prison/they kick you out if you aren’t doing well apparently ? Unless you’re super low bmi. Being picky could be bad but I also know ERC has pretty American basic food. It is larger so probably less personalized, and they might dislike me because I insulted and ACA’ed from the Chicago ERC (it was terrible)",1639944139.0

I'd really like to run my marathon eventually, go back to my running group (hard bc I gained a lot of weight and I'm embarrassed--and also I'm not fit enough to keep up with them anymore), and strength train. The problem is that I think I associate working out with restricting or making up for caloric intake. Even if I run just 1 mile, I have a binge--maybe because in my head I mentally start tallying up calories or my body starts freaking out since I used to use exercise to purge.

My body has changed some in fact. I was not trying, but lost some weight from the testosterone. I stopped weighing myself so I didn't even know, until I went to the Dr's recently.

Most of the ocd worrying and obsessive thoughts are gone. I did have a melt down a few weeks ago when I realized my shoulders got bigger and my waist got smaller, and none of my work shirts fit anymore.

Anyway I was told a few years ago that I really would not be able to recover from the Ed without gender affirming care. Now I see what they meant. I couldn't trust my team until I knew that they weren't forcing me to lose weight, so I'd be more feminized/gender conforming.

It sounds like a pipe dream to me because I don’t have functioning hunger cues so I literally don’t know how I’m supposed to know how much to eat. I haven’t eaten “normally” since I was a pre-teen. Dietitians just put me on strict plans which wrecked me, mentally. I can’t ever forget the exchanges for foods. 

Our bodies are smart, right? We shouldn’t need to count calories or macros to maintain overall health. Looking at all of the factors that go into CICO, it confuses me. How does one maintain their weight with all of those factors? Is it with intuitive eating? How does one even get to intuitive eating after having an ED? How TF do normal people eat and maintain their weight? It’s so anxiety provoking to make a meal without counting exchanges or calories, but clearly we’re not meant to calculate everything we eat. I want to listen to my body but I don’t know how. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Any advice? I’m so sick of thinking so much about food. It shouldn’t be this fucking difficult to just eat and be healthy.",1639364216.0
Underweight again but too depressed to care (TW/ mention of suicide),25,rf5c4x,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/rf5c4x/underweight_again_but_too_depressed_to_care_tw/,3,"I’ve been relapsing in my ED for the past 4 months or so, and discovered recently I’m underweight. I haven’t been underweight in over three years. Back then, I was thrilled to see the number on the scale. Now, I feel surprised to see that number is even lower than before and am even more surprised about my apathy toward it. I don’t count calories, I don’t eat healthily, but I guess since my job requires me to be active and I don’t eat much during the day, that has contributed to my (somewhat) unintentional weight loss. My bf has expressed some concern over how I look and encourages me to eat more, but due to my extremely depressed mood, I don’t feel any want or urge to do so. My mental health is terrible and I’ve been having suicidal ideation for about a month. I’m not sure if this is bc of discontent with where my life is right now or bc I’m not getting enough nutrients (I’m sure it’s a combination of the two), but I feel as if I’m floating through life without any purpose. When I was underweight 3 years ago, I was in college, going through a break up- I had an active social life and didn’t have any financial concerns. Now that is not the case. I can barely afford to live on my current salary, but ironically enough, this is probably the most high-paying job I can get with my degree. I want to go back to school to get a graduate degree, but am so depressed I never actively look for programs/ loans I could get to do so. Ironically enough, despite being underweight, I look awful and feel grosser than ever- I don’t work out often and am very “skinny fat”. I’m very scared about my family’s reaction when I see them for the holidays. Social interaction has been difficult for me lately, and I’m dreading the inevitable exhaustion of trying to keep up this “everything is okay/ great” facade around them for the next couple weeks. The older I get and more entrenched I become in my ED the harder it is to reach out for help. I feel like I am destined to become my mother, who is a stay at home mom, still active in her ED, and in complete denial about her mental illness.

Colleague keeps commenting on my size :(,82,re1njl,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/re1njl/colleague_keeps_commenting_on_my_size/,25,"Last month I started a new job. I’ll note from the beginning, I work in medical science (specifically anatomy/physiology). There is this colleague I have, same faculty, a middle aged man whose background is not related at all to med sci. He keeps making comments about my size. At this point I am getting upset. 

First, he was talking about nutrition and IF, gestured at my body and commented that I am clearly good at fasting. I ignored him. Second, we were sharing stories about students in our labs, and I spoke about how a chemical I work with can have a side effect of hunger (which freaks students out when they are looking at embalmed bodies). He again gestured at my body and told me, obviously I do not experience that side effect. I ignored him. 

The third time was after I carried a very heavy box of chemicals up to his lab. By the time I got there I was visibly suffering from the trip. He said “you need to eat more, you need to gain weight, you are very skinny”. I dismissed this so he repeated himself. I changed the topic to the chemicals and he said “okay fine, we won’t talk about your personal issues”. I ignored him. 

This week, we were in my lab and my hands were gross colours because it is extremely cold in there. He pointed this out, then told me it’s because I have no fat, and must have poor circulation because I’m too thin. I ignored him. Later this day we had to weigh equipment and he said “that’s got to be close to you”. I didn’t respond. A moment later he *literally guessed my weight*. He said that I can’t weigh much, then “what do you weigh? About Xkg?” I said “it’s not a good idea to guess what people weigh” and he laughed it off. (He got my weight correct, thankfully). After he left, I cried in my office. 

I was crying because of the attention to my size and body. The fact that my weight is being thought about. His previous comment about my “personal issues” also made me anxious that he may have said something to other colleagues about me. One comment was made at a social event, which was hard enough, and we have another coming up this week (I looked at the menu, I don’t want to do it 😭). 

I know I need to really speak up in the future, I have a few concerns though including drawing more attention. I just want people to not focus on my size, and to keep their comments to themselves.

i feel like i *feel* so much more when im restricting or purging etc even if its mainly shitty feelings and thoughts.  but the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is basically binge eat or eat normally with no compensatory behaviours. 


i just feel so numb & my life so bland that i dont rly care right now too cry over it anymore or too franticly restrict the next day.its not like this doesnt make me hella uncomfortable. i just feel nothing no good or bad emotions just uncomfortableness & worry my ed is slipping away. not caring enough on either side too continue restriction or eating normally.


i cycle alot thru different phases like p/b, pure restriction, over excersize, lax abuse etc. 
but rn im not rly doing any of that for the past two weeks and im scared my ed has gone or smth. 
ik its not rly true- the thoughts r there, theres still things i refuse too eat and behaviours i use. 
i feel disgusting & am planning on how too loose the weight but i just feel Nothing rn & its causing me too not care enough about if im gaining etc.  


is this just part of a cycle do other ppl w eds kinda sometimes go too a point of remission?? idk what too call it.

I wasn't lying and the only reason I was that open is cuz I'm feeling loose and also a fair bit friendly with the old jack Daniels. 

But I didn't send it. I can't share that. Wtf how could I be that open with anyone?? I couldn't. I wouldn't. They don't need the burden of knowing how awful I feel. Deleted. Removed. No need to act like I'd ever share that.

I think maybe I did to my friend, deleted straight away ofc but she got a notif and replied saying hey girl u okay? Haaaah.oooop. here we are here we are. 

Drunk and stoned and I've been sad for so long and it's all made worse by the fact I won't fucking feed myself. 

Did you know not eating makes your serotonin go low? Like scientifically low? Like actually being hangry and angry and low? 

Just take my word for it. It's a bit of a bitch. If I could go back and do all of this would I ever do it? ""Because skinny""? Because maybe having control and because maybe feeling like I can do anything at all. 

Can you do anything though?

I find now that when I'm binging (which never happens without purging or restriction afterwards), I barely even experience the food. I'm just rushing through it as quickly as possible. The only thing I feel is a few minutes of numbness as I begin to imbibe followed by panic and self-loathing as soon as the feeling of uncomfortable fullness comes and I've finished it all, because I know I only have 20 minutes tops before I have to get rid of it. The only real excitement/enjoyment I experience in the process is in the period between the decision to b/p and the actual purchasing of the food.

When I first began b/p'ing 20 years ago, I remember so much more pleasure and escape during the binge, whereas now it's just a joyless and sensory deprived race against the clock. I wouldn't even be able to tell you how anything I ate tasted after the fact. 

For BED's, is there more enjoyment in the eating experience when it happens without the purge countdown?

changed mind & ended up bloody eating it without trying too think too much. 

but now im just kinda panicking & feel uncomfortable because it wasnt in my plan & i dont know whats in it or the cals or anything i feel like i can feel the fat seeping into my stomach. 
like i just wish i hadnt ate it. 

it tasted good and its nice too not miss out again but its just so uncomfortable and i feel guilty about it my stomach feels warm and uncomfortable af. 

ik if this would have happened a few weeks ago when i was deeper in my ed and restricting more i would have been mortified but since ive sort of started feeling and eating abit differently (not recovery but idk) im not *tooo* stressed over it. 

 it just feels wrong. should i have ate it or not? i cant really justify either.",1638968175.0

How do you feel about it? Does it make you proud/self-conscious/both? i have so much of it on every part of my body except my collarbones, feet and hands/wrists, and i have mixed feelings about it. i'm embarrassed when i go out in public in a short/sleeveless t-shirt and feel like people are staring at my upper arms waving in the wind and when i go running i always wear yoga pants under my shorts so no one will be grossed out at my thighs that keep moving after i've stopped. i tend to wear baggy pants and long-sleeved shirts for the same reason. i'm constantly aware that people might realize i've lost this weight in a really unhealthy way, and judge me. i'm also secretly in love with it. It's a sign of my progress. i wont mention my numbers here for fear of being deleted, but it's substantial. 

Not to hijack my own thread, but this is related so i'll add it here. Do you have a chest/other parts\[if you know, you know\] that deflated and sank? Does it make you feel like no one of your preferred sexual partner gender could find you attractive? Do you have trouble being naked in front of your s/o because you feel like there's no way they could want to look at you? How has it affected that part of your life? It's really, really hard for me. i can't help but think my body is disgusting. my s/o has no problem with the way i look. He tells me all day every day that i'm beautiful. He loved me at my highest weight and he loves me now at my lowest. He hates what this illness has done to my mental state, but to him i'm still physically attractive.

is it possible too still have an ed if things like this happen,5,rbb6wo,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/rbb6wo/is_it_possible_too_still_have_an_ed_if_things/,4,"
for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours & thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot/ or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged- but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. 

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it. 

 
idk. just feel so invalid and fake and undisciplined. is this even an ed. ugh",1638915796.0
I can’t end this cycle and I’m so sick of myself - TW numbers and more,24,raypvs,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/raypvs/i_cant_end_this_cycle_and_im_so_sick_of_myself_tw/,7,"TW - numbers, sexual harassment, body checking 

I am starting to get sad and scared about my body now. Restricting isn’t solving anything anymore. I’m in my 30s and I’m now at my weight when I was 15… which is still healthy, but I lost more than 30 lbs  since August which I guess was the point of this all but I can’t stop, and I don’t want to stop, and I genuinely feel some sort of high when I restrict. It makes everything okay, especially when it’s not. 

Successfully restricting and the results give me validation and make me feel like more of a worthy person/woman. When everything else is fucked up, I can still go to bed satisfied knowing I accomplished something by restricting. And the attention I get from that makes me feel like I’m doing something right.

I am getting (unwelcome) attention now from men who I don’t really want attention from, but again it makes me feel like I’m finally doing something right, when everything else is going wrong. And the attention is almost a fucked up form of praise in my brain. But it’s making me feel so guilty. I am so confused, but what I am sure of is that I never wanted or asked to be in this position. 

 Ive complained about my toxic work environment here before and how my boss started getting suggestive and creepy when I began noticeably losing (staring, inappropriate conversations alone with me re: his dead bedroom, making me jump for him in a tight dress after I said no multiple times, telling me my hair is pretty, hovering over or next to me and things like that… the list is endless). It’s totally toxic and I felt so guilty about it bc he’s almost twice my age married (I am too) etc … not like I was seeking this out at all but it made me feel like shit obviously, and quite honestly at some points I felt very violated. 

But … as much as I hate it, it was also validating in the sense that it made me feel like I lost weight and therefore am doing something right. Which made me even more angry because now I feel taken advantage of for that, bc I’m vulnerable because of my ED and having recently had a baby.

And then he went out of his way to tell me I’ve lost weight, that he’s concerned about me because he hasn’t seen me eating at work (I no longer eat at work and I completely restrict until I get home- so he’s right). It was then that I realized that he is validating my ED. I wanted someone to recognize that I’m not okay. But why is it him? 

It’s all making me feel so guilty, and my ED is just getting worse. My body feels so different now, I can feel my tail bone when I’m sitting and my shoulders are so much more bony. I can feel my hips and just my hips, and my abdominal muscles too. I haven’t felt that since high school. This is what I wanted, what I still want, but somehow I feel sad. 

And now, my hair is so thin and continues to fall out in huge clumps. My nails break once a day, I don’t even know how. My mouth has these thick inflamed lines inside and my upper lip is numb. Every time I get up I see white and almost pass out. I’m dizzy, I have headaches and brain fog. It hurts to lay on my side because my knees hit each other. 

But I can’t stop. 

And it all feels so complex. I want to go to work and just work and be praised for doing a good job. But recently when I’ve gotten good results, instead of “good job” it’s been “when did you date that person.” It makes me so fucking mad. But it also makes me feel like y ED is working, that I’m finally good at something. 

How can I fucking complain about this if I find it validating? I’m sad and upset because aside from my ED issues I feel like a horrible woman for not standing up for myself more and making it stop. But every time there’s a comment, or every time he voices concern, it’s validation that yes I’m not faking, that I do have an ED, and it’s working and I’m losing, and (in my fucked up brain) I’m a more legitimate/worthy person. 

I feel so guilty for being on the receiving end of this, for not standing up for myself more, and for feeling this way. This situation just one big negative feedback loop that I don’t know how to get out of. And I feel like it’s my fault.

Please tell me someone can relate. Please tell me I’m not alone cause I really feel like it",1638882080.0
What's the alternative to a meal plan?,7,rb65eh,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/rb65eh/whats_the_alternative_to_a_meal_plan/,5,"I've been following HeAlThY MeAl pLaNs with BaLaNcEd sTrUcTuReD pOrTiOnS for years now. And I used to eat very normally before the onset of my illness. I am perfectly aware of what normal eating looks like. I could draw a meal plan on the spot myself and prescribe it to others. I could write a book on normal, healthy, balanced, structured meals.

Problem is, it does f*ck all for curing my mind - it only exacerbates my obsessive tendencies around food AND it never satisfies me on top of that. It always feels like restriction. At least with *my* restriction I can daydream of the day where I FINALLY will be able to eat EVERYTHING I want. Following ""structured meal plans"" just feels like misery, all the time, forever. I can't fathom doing that for the rest of my life - I'd rather take my own life at some point. Literally. Not joking. 

My therapist actually said to me that I will never be able to go back to what I was pre-ED because that intuitiveness around food is gone forever, so at this point I should just follow a meal plan so that at least I don't die. And when he said that, I cried. I felt so lost and hopeless.

And I'm so frustrated that no one seems to understand. Meal plans seem to be the golden treatment and if you're not okay with them then everyone treats you like you're actually refusing meal plans because you have some other deep rooted psychological issue, like you're scared of giving up control, you're scared of feeling full or whatever, and in reality meal plans *do* satisfy you but you wanna use binges to fill your inner emptiness...after years of this bullshit I just roll my eyes and yawn. I'm tired.

But...what is the alternative? I wanna recover. But I know that if I truly, deeply, sincerely let myself eat whatever I want, whenever I want, however much I want, without restrictions and limits, I would just...eat everything, all the time, forever.",1638902617.0

Have had anorexia for almost nine years now. I saw a dietitian from ages 13-20 and it helped sometimes but other times it made me more obsessive (exchanges) and being weighed triggered TF out of me. I could tell by her expression whether I gained or not and she would get mad at me if I lost weight even if I did exactly what she said to do. I was also never allowed to try intuitive eating. Also it's super expensive. I was seeing her twice a week, totally $140-200. My therapist alone is $95.

For those who aren't seeing a dietitian, how is it going? How do you know that you're doing well? I tried the ""all in"" method last year and it was fine at first but led to binging and then I relapsed. I really don't want to follow a strict meal plan so I'm thinking it might be easiest to give myself some basic guidelines, like 3 meals and 3 snacks minimum.

Thing is, even though they meant it as a compliment and that would normally make me happy, I'm so confused.

According to the scales and my measuring tape...I'm the same. Maybe a few lbs heavier, although I put that down to eating more so I don't faint on the job lol.

So since that comment, I've been having a bit of a spiral. Has more physical activity plus eating more caused water retention, meaning that I have lost weight and it's just not in the areas I measure myself and the water weight has caused the scales to mislead me? Did my collar bones just poke out more that day? Have I gained muscle due to the physicality of the job while also losing weight, meaning I've lost fat so look smaller? If I have lost weight, it must be a small amount yet they noticed, so they'd notice if I gained weight too. Now my dumb ED brain is saying that I have to restrict more so that they never see me with weight gain.

On the flip side, my friends don't comment on people's bodies and *never* compliment weight loss because multiple of us have had restrictive EDs in the past. Despite seeing me go from obese to a BMI of >!21!< in 7 months, they say that I look the same / haven't noticed me lose any weight. I've lost 25% of my body weight and >!16!< inches from my waist, and they're saying they can't see any difference?? I understand why they do it, but christ it was invalidating and it *also* made me restrict more.

He weighed himself for the first time in a long time and it was the highest he's ever weighed. I am also at my highest ever weight. Mostly due to my alcohol consumption (as in I barely eat all day and then drink copious amounts at night... I know, I know...)

Guys, gals, and nonbinary pals, when I say he lost his mind, I mean he lost it to the point where I was wondering if I needed to take the kids out of the house for a bit for their safety. He was stomping around, raving about how fat he is and how fat is ugly and how he's never going to eat again and he's never weighed this much in his life... You get the idea.

My 9 year old (bless his sweet little heart, and I do NOT mean the Southern way) spoke up and said ""Dad, you don't need to not eat. That's not healthy. What you should do is use your weights and walk on the treadmill and take the dogs for walks."" When I say I was so PROUD of this kid, you have no idea 😍

But he was ignored and the ranting and raving continued. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and said ""Please stop. You are seriously triggering me right now and I can't afford what will happen."" He knows about my eating disorder and has seen me struggle with it throughout our relationship. It is very rare for me to speak so bluntly about it.

And he said... ""Maybe you should be. Your weight isn't healthy either."" (Note: I weigh less than he does but I am quite a bit shorter so I am about a point above him on the BMI scale)

I started crying and my 9 year old went to his room and slammed the door. He was angry on my behalf, and the kid doesn't officially know about my eating disorder, although he may suspect.

I am so, so triggered. And I finally stood up for myself and the one person who should have supported me in that... He didn't care. In fact, he's demanding that we get rid of all the unhealthy food in the house and only have fruits, veggies, and lean meats and nothing else. Which would be great if my kid didn't have ARFID and would starve to death. Seriously, at lunch my 3yo was eating a hot dog and he gave me a bite. I took it, of course, and my freaking husband said ""you know those aren't good for you and you shouldn't be eating them."" ONE BITE. It was ONE BITE. To keep a toddler happy.

i cant watch things for long unless their related too ed's, food, weight loss, or i feel there a good use of my time (like they're beneficial too my ed) so not even that i can escape too which used too be the biggest coping thing for me. love that.

restricted this week successfully after not rly doing it 'good' for a few weeks & gained weight too a number i was uncomfortable with. 
diddnt weigh for a few days whilst restricting bc i had not enough time in schedule too weigh how i need too like before hand so wasnt sure how much/ if i lost/ gained. 
but felt like i was eating unsafe/ too much during those days even though i was tracking & was restricting. was halve sure i gained and halve sure i lost. but just begging too just b under what i considered uncomfortable / dangerous weight. 

so today when i could finally i did and was relieved & elated too see i lost way more than i thought i did. - too a num ive not been in a month or so. 
then i seem too always fall back into a pattern of when i loose weight part of me thinks its ok too eat so i fucking did & i ate mainly chocolate and crap. 

restricted in a sense but stopped tracking cals after abit but im sure it was around my maintenance ?  

spent the rest of the day every time after eating resetting my fucking fasting timer & then after the initial freak out & guilt of what i just ate went away id eat again and reset again. 

cried basically the whole afternoon and night lol and tried too excersize abit but just too tired too !! (so now i feel like a fake and guilty coz i cant even compensate good enough ha) & used unhealthy coping mechanisms after but now im just lying here 10pm tears sticking too my face feeling like such a faliure sad little piece of crap ha bcos not only did i unsuccessfully purge, excersize &  restrict. 

im paranoid & sad af that tomorrow when i weigh i will have gained and that number will be further away again & ill be forever stuck in a cycle of reaching a gw, giving in & eating, loosing control & gaining & then spendjng weeks just trying to get back control & too a manageable comfortable weight. 

i feel like ive ruined everything and my body will just balloon overnight. 
 like all these cals will turn too fat since i'm just lying here in bed not utilising it for energy. 

i feel too guilty too sleep but i'm tired af and too tired too workout which makes me feel guilty clz if i was rly unwell i would do it regardless until it felt safe too stop.

Now I know I could just hop on the marketplace or whatever they call it and apply for insurance through the state...but I have literally done nothing for an entire week, my brain is in a state of atrophy, and I have a huge case of the fuck-its. 

I'm not even medically unstable right now (I was when I did the intake for the program which is why they want me to do inpatient first), but fuck, I just want all this to end. I haven't worked full time in almost 2 years, and I've been pretty much fully out of work since March (medical leaves, etc). I haven't applied for a job in almost 5 years, and even if I could conjure up the mental stamina to do that, I have no idea what I'm interested in anymore other than mental health...but I think that working in mental health for so long now was part of my downfall.

I am pear shaped and my shape doesn't bother me at all but my weight sure does. I'm ashamed that I'm not a good restrictor anymore. I'm nostalgic for the days of being at my LW.

Do you guys have any advice/encouragement for going to inpatient?,3,r7k9bj,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/r7k9bj/do_you_guys_have_any_adviceencouragement_for/,5,"Possible TW

I'm on the waitlist but I still haven't decided if I'm going. I'm not ready to let go of my ed, and I've heard that I'll never be ready to, but is that true? I feel like I've seen/heard so many people say that they're just tired of it and ready to get better, but I don't feel that way. I think a lot of it might have to do with how strong my si is, but it's a part of me and I just don't want to give it up. Don't get me wrong, it's making me miserable. I'm so irritable and I can't even hike anymore which is my biggest passion. I'm out of breath from walking across a parking lot and have to sit for 5 minutes before I can even hold a conversation. My skin is utter shit and overall I feel terrible physically, but that's all so validating to my ed.

And with the mental aspect, when I don't eat I don't dissociate or have flashbacks. Yeah, my anxiety is terrible and again, I'm so irritable and lacking so much empathy and it's incredibly frustrating and I'm starting to hate myself for it, but at the same time, it's what's keeping me alive right now. Restricting is something that I'm good at and I just...don't want to let it go.

Having my first child really helped put things into perspective, and I earned a lot more respect for my body and what it can do. 

For those who don’t know, gestational diabetes is basically diabetes caused by your placenta when you’re pregnant. The good news is it goes away as soon as you give birth, and it doesn’t mean the baby will have diabetes - it’s just a “fun” side effect of crazy hormones that happens in around 10% of pregnancies. However, it means that I’ll have to carefully watch what I eat and monitor my blood sugar. But the problem is, when I’m “watching what I eat,” that just turns into not eating. I get overwhelmed with meal planning and choices, and end up just going back to my anorexic days.

My sister-in-law texted me today to excitedly let me know that after she and my brother spent time with me during Thanksgiving weekend they both noticed that  “I seem like I’m doing well and feeling good” and that I “have more energy”. 
She knows I have an ED and she is familiar with a lot of the shit I’ve gone through. I have recently lost weight because unfortunately I’ve relapsed like a motherfucker. After trying to recover for years and gaining quite a bit of weight, I’m backsliding pretty rapidly and I’m actually not doing well and I also definitely did NOT have a lot of energy this weekend. I feel like she googled “how to compliment someone on losing weight without mentioning their weight” and texted me. I asked her point blank “are you saying you noticed I lost weight?” And she was like “hahaha yes but I didn’t want to make it seem like it was just that!” Lots of smiley happy emoji and shit like she was excited to share the good news that they noticed I’m losing weight. 
I fucking hate the bullshit texts and I hate that she was talking about my body with my brother and she should fucking know better. I’m not doing well. I feel like I’ll never be able to have children because the idea of gaining weight is horrifying for me. My life is not what I wanted and I hate that people associate weight loss with “feeling better and having more energy” because I feel like shit. I know she meant it to be positive but I wanted to say “how dumb do you think I am? I know what you’re trying to say. We have conversations all the time about how no one should comment on anyones bodies and here you are making a very obvious allusion to the fact that I’ve lost weight and you want to mention it in someway because you think it will thrill me”.

Experiences with harm reduction and supported ED management?,23,r4w5kh,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/r4w5kh/experiences_with_harm_reduction_and_supported_ed/,3,"Hi all, my title doesn’t really make such sense but I’m hoping that the post will!
I’m F19 and from the UK, I’m about 6 weeks out of a 6 month long IP stint and I’m struggling. I was under the Mental Health Act for the entirety of my stay and as a result got barely any say in my treatment plan, the only thing I was able to negotiate was being discharged slightly underweight because I knew that I wouldn’t be able to cope with weight restoration up to the BMI which is standard. 

I honestly had no intention of maintaining that weight however I wasn’t quite expecting the relapse to be as quick as it has been. I’ve lost quite a bit of weight in the past 6 weeks and I know if I continue I’m on a one way train back to IP. I’ve had to defer my university place twice already due to being in treatment and the lack of being able to “move on” with my life really gets to me. 

Every fibre in my being wants me to just get worse and to put myself in a more dangerous position health and weight wise than I was in when I went in last time. However I know that I’ll probably just end up spending another spring/summer in hospital and missing out on going to university again. 

My ED community team has said that they will no longer be working with me because of my weight loss however they had offered to take me back for a few sessions in order to work on maintaining my weight and managing my ED, so I can continue to work and eventually go on to study, once I reach a weight that I feel comfortable with (so long as my health isn’t immediately at risk). 

Basically I wanted some guidance or just to hear the experience of others who have been in similar positions, I hope you can understand and respect that I don’t want to or feel able to recover right now. I just feel like giving myself the opportunity to live and study is better than years in and out of hospital. Thank you so much for reading my long and confusing ramble.",1638193498.0

sorry its kinda long ! i just dont know how too feel & explain shorter i need advice so bad. 

ive been struggling for just over a yr now, and since September this yr just going between feeling in the depths of my ed & heavily restriction, too feeling alright with my food, body & life. Therefor not feeling the need to cope with restriction or engaging in ed behaviours as much. 

within weeks of eachother
i feel like ive just been in a cycle of severely restricting;feeling the worst i have mentally and physically. too my mood improving and being able too ignore the ed voice & eat fairly normally with less compensatory behaviours. 

feel i came out of a very depressive slump Throughout the last 2 weeks, during which i was restricting & engaging in many disordered behaviours, then last week during trying to restrict i could feel my mood & depressive state starting to lift & found it easier too eat etc, found myself justifying it being ok too eat instead of the opposite. 
but then engaging alot in purging too compensate. 

since about friday last week i've been eating basically normally, not rly restricting & not purging in any way & only engaging in a few behaviours (like timings, eating w certain utensils, kcal checking) mostly without even realising-which tbh i am glad about, bcos otherwise id feel way too uncomfortable feeling & acting so 'normal' so quick. 
i did become vegan in sept too make restr/ less stressful.  

ive not really been listening or heard the ed voice as much Which makes me think I have just been putting everything on. 
like i have chose too push this voice more & more in my head in the past or really just myself telling me these things. 

I partly know this isnt true and what i've felt in the past was valid & real. but i just dont understand how i now i can so easily 'decide' too eat normally & use less behaviours. feel less scrutinising of my body and stopping to weigh myself as much.

I feel uncomfortable that i feel so normal & okay. 
I do in general find it hard too accept feeling happy; prefering the comfort of depression- using this too fuel my ed. but since my mood/ mental state has improved it just feels easier too eat. 

im comforted by the fact that i'm sure by the end of this week ill sort of 'snap out of it' i guess. & realise what ive been doing & all the guilt will sort of catch up too me. but also afraid that it wont and ill just have made the quickest ed recovery in mankind. 

like this is just such an uncomfortable position it feels. i'm not actively trying to recover but also not engaging as much in ed behaviours and eating normally. i'm sure when my mood dips again ill go back too restricting but i feel so guilty, like i was able too take a 'break' from my ed as soon as my mood improved. and therefor it was never there in the first place. I feel like my brains just constantly split into 2 parts & sometimes i just have too much control and can choose too let myself eat like this and justify it like a normal person. like how is this the same person who a week ago had so much confusion & turmoil over too let herself eat halve a fucking sweet potato. what. 


i just always feel like as long as i think my behaviour & eating is disordered then i'm okay and safe. not too far gone. 
the only reason ive been okay with eating normally since friday with no compensatory behaviours is that i've been telling myself its a binge. when i know its not but feeling/acting normal is just too much too accept.  

was any of what i felt in the past even valid, too have said i had an ed?

I feel like such a liar, as if i would just push myself to feel worse too benefit my ed. 

does anyone else ever go through phases like this. 
Is it normal with an ed. 

ik that the part of me trying too grasp on too what ed behaviours i have still been using is in itself disordered but i feel like the only person whos ever done this and been able too have consecutive days like this. 

i feel like ive been faking all along. and ik i wasnt so maybe i just was never as bad as i thought. i dont know. 
maybe when my mood drops again ill realise what i've done and itll all come crashing down lol. 

tysm for reading ik it was long af- i just need help and too know if this is normal among ppl with an ed.  

stay safe:)


update: 
relapsed af about a week later maybe & shit hit the fan again lol. halve of me is relieved ive not 'lost' or like 'forgotten' how too use behaviours & 'have an ed' idk how else too describe it. it feels relieving too use behaviours and not feel emotionally content/ or neutral  again but also abit disheartening like i feel im just perpetuating this cycle and a little worried that i wont ever get out. anyways back too square one ig.",1638185517.0

Treatment trauma and refusing to step on a scale/ is recovery possible?,3,r4mwev,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/r4mwev/treatment_trauma_and_refusing_to_step_on_a_scale/,3,"When I was in high school I became severely anorexic, was admitted to inpatient treatment against my will obviously, and had a very traumatic time in treatment. This was 2005, Princeton medical center, which was absolutely horrid with the way they treated the patients. It created more of an ED and yes, I survived and got “healthy” but what I also got was 3 more forms of Ed and PTSD. I refuse to step on scales because I went through years of OCD weighing myself several times a day. When I stopped using scales my mental health got better but I obviously still have an Ed, I’m more orthorexic and anorexic tendencies. I am a “normal” weight for my short midget (not really) height. Right now, my Ed is only thriving because of my auto immune issues and hashimotos. My body reacts to so many foods and I gain weight so easily since I have hypothyroidism so I eat like an anorexic and in a very orthorexic way. I’m currently seeing a thyroid dr and she said once my thyroid is level I will feel better and be able to feel better when I eat and eat more foods. My depression has reached an all time low. My birthday is in a couple weeks and I am considering trying to find a residential 30 day program for my depression, NOT my Ed. At this point, I have accepted that my Ed is part of me and I need help with my trauma and depression because if I don’t get help with that then what’s the point of living? Weighing myself will do exactly what it did years ago when I weighed myself, give me panic attacks that are anger fueled and self harm will occur. So I am not willing to put my mental health on the line by being weighed. I am not emaciated, I look normal and healthy so I don’t see a reason why weighing is needed for folks like me who have trauma related to treatment. 

I need support and a higher level of care but my situation is complex and I feel so stuck. I want to get treatment for my depression but I REFUSE to step on a fuckinf scale. I also refuse to gain more weight. In a perfect world I would like to heal my thyroid, metabolism etc and get depression / trauma treatment and be able to get my life back.",1638158464.0

I've been dating my boyfriend for three years and he's so amazing and loving. He never makes comments on my body except for positive ones. He knows that I feel insecure about my weight but I've never really opened up to him about my disordered thoughts, or the problems I've had in the past with anorexia as well as binging/purging. I stopped the extreme restricting and purging almost a decade ago (I was 15 when I stopped and I'm now 24), but I do still have obsessive thoughts about my body and food and the desire to restrict/binge. I do binge in private ocassionally and then restrict later, but I'm working on it. 

Anyway, there were only seven of us at this event. It was just me, my boyfriend, his mom, his grandma, his aunt, his brother and his brother's girlfriend. His brother's girlfriend, Kate (fake name), is super thin and petite in general. She's like a size zero or two and I'm...not. His brother Nathan is also pretty thin while my boyfriend is a little bigger. 

We all start to line up for food and my boyfriend's mom goes ""all the skinny people have to go to the back of the line! So that would basically just be Kate and Nathan."" 

I know I shouldn't let it bother me but it triggered me so bad. Later I told my boyfriend that it really hurt my feelings and he apologized but said that his mom ""didn't mean it like that.""

I spent the last three hours freaking out, calling the pest company, throwing out any food in bags or boxes, throwing out the bird feeder, washing everything in the kitchen, and now I'm starting to sanitize the counter because I doubt it will ever feel clean in here again. I never even had coffee. I haven't even had a shower yet. I hate this stupid house, I'm grossed out, and I'm trying not to cry because I don't want my husband to wake up to a crazy crying lady.

I'm 33, I've had my ED to varying levels of severity since I was 15 or 16. While my behaviors are mostly managed, I often wonder if I'll ever get better since I'm still plagued by disordered thoughts, body checking, and occasionally purging/using laxatives.

On the other hand... I miss being sicker. I miss being XX lbs lighter than I am now. I'm at a perfectly normal/healthy weight for my height and I hate it. I feel like a hog - especially because of my age I hate where the fat on my body is distributing. 

I have having to deal with all this dumb adult shit. I want to hide away in a treatment center. I'm not saying that recovery isn't hard and that HLOC aren't hard but it's really different than the tedious, boring, grind of the day-to-day working and paying bills etc etc

But honestly I'm so ashamed of feeling like this (hence the throw away lol). I'm a grown woman. I just got married to my partner of 5 years, with whom I have a house and two dogs.

And I’m like I work 9-5, do you have any thing else available? Kind of desperate because I REALLY REALLY want to recover and I really don’t want this to be my life, that my shitty minimum wage job means I can’t even complete the intake assessment. 

They’re like “ No, we only do appointments Monday-Friday 9 am - 2 pm. So your options are to cancel your request and go off the waiting list or we can go to the next person on the waiting list and call you when another appt becomes available.”

After 12 fucking months on the waiting list... I can’t even do the intake assessment because I work full time. Like if I could take an afternoon off on such short notice, do you think I would be on a 12 month waiting list for publiclyfunded treatment? Not everyone works from home or works an office job, I can’t take 2 hours off in the middle of a weekday. 

So now, after struggling with my ED for 11 fucking years, I can’t access treatment because I work during the week.

It’s out of the table that I’ve been distancing myself from my former main friend group, and although I haven’t explicitly stated it and I’m sure it’s obvious: you are my only friends now. The kindness and consideration showed towards me reaffirmed how poorly treated I felt by my former close friends.

Most of all, I’m so grateful of how kind and rational you were about food. My other friend group would constantly eat and have to eat out at restaurants when on trips and I would be stuffed and uncomfortable constantly on those trips due to the social binging dynamic established.

We walked into a grocery store the first day, just to pick things up for our stay, and I admitted that “I don’t know what I even eat anymore”. I wandered off alone and picked up some honestly baffling food items upon review. There were no negative comments. You both picked out some things I wouldn’t have picked up for myself like snacks and frozen pizzas and made it clear they were for everyone to share and enjoy.

For the stay we ate all those items and I never once felt pressured or truly freaked out. We barely ate out, and when we did it didn’t feel intimidating to me because I didn’t feel like I’d been eating poorly the entire trip because none of us had been. I was able to snack on the chips and pretzels and enjoy them without feeling discomfort impeding on me because I was enjoying my time with you.

You guys were just so rational and sane about food, and whenever I did something weird I didn’t feel like I got mocked or made fun of, especially when I willingly explained myself (thank you for letting me put the chips in the fridge when I asked it was wigging me out lol). You guys made the trip about having fun or doing activities and much less about having to eat at every great restaurant or whatever which is something I enjoyed.

I’m just so grateful. Vacations always trigger me into a binge and purge period after I return and I found that while I still binged upon my return it was a binge only in the sense that I’m not used to eating normal portions anymore, I can logically see that despite how I feel. It wasn’t the absolute crisis and breakdown it always is though.

I’m sorry that we all have admittedly between us have suffered with food and weight issues to some extent, our chat while on the trip shed full light on that.

TW for restrictive eating etc

TLDR: I’m a college student about to go home for a long winter break who is looking into starting my ED recovery process but is scared and clueless about how to approach it especially regarding family and shame.

For some background, I am 22 and a college senior currently finishing a full time internship before heading back to class in the spring. I have always struggled with my body image and eating habits, but my ED became rampant over the past year. I gained weight and went up a few sizes during early covid and was really struggling with that change and set out to lose weight in a healthy way this spring/summer. At first i was successful by kicking my slight binging habit and eating actual healthy and nutritious meals and casually exercising, however i was unable to keep up with everything and slowly started developing really bad habits. I started losing a lot of weight because I was eating less and working out, and my mom (she doesn’t know better) was quick to point out that i had lost weight and to keep up with whatever i was doing. I moved back to the city i go to school in and stopped working out due to accessibility and laziness, but that made my restrictive eating worse since i was (and still am lol) afraid of putting the weight back on. At first it was easy to ignore but i can’t keep overlooking the hair loss, fatigue, headaches, fuzzy memory, lack of energy and social presence, stomachaches etc as if they are normal. This combined with the senior scaries and the worst bout of seasonal depression of my life so far have not made for the best circumstances 😅 I know that I need to get my shit together for my health, especially as I try and learn how to be a real and functioning adult but I am so scared. I am so scared of gaining back the weight, I am so scared of having to be responsible for my physical and mental health, and I am absolutely petrified to have to tell my family that I need support right now. 

I have a small family (mom, dad, older sibling) and we are all so close and I am not afraid of them not supporting me, but I am so scared to have to make them aware of my problem. Like I mentioned earlier my mom makes a lot of comments on my body. I really do not take them that personally however as I know she has also struggled with her body image and weight (and probably where i got some of my patterns from to be honest) and always tells me that I am so beautiful no matter what size i am. I will just never forget how heartbreaking it was to see her so excited that I had slimmed down after practically starving myself. I’m scared that my family will feel like they have failed me in some way and also scared that there will be a lot of fights as I am extremely stubborn and we are all very snappy. We also spend quite a lot of time together as we are all kind of homebodies.

So i come to y’all asking for advice on how to approach recovery. I have to include my family because I am about to go home for 7 weeks and I don’t think that I will be able to or should hide what I am going through but i don’t know how to start. How do you tell your parents something like this? What steps are necessary to getting support and having accountability without going insane and causing the entire family to hurt? How can I tell my mom specifically knowing her history of body commentary? I’ve told one friend and definitely not with full honesty about the situation and know i’m not comfortable talking to my friends about it right now. I know that I have been going on for a while and it feels like i’m shouting into the dark so I apologize for the giant info dump and thank you again for reading this!",1637282160.0

Burden to employers. Do I just have to lie on my resume?,38,qvxh7q,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/qvxh7q/burden_to_employers_do_i_just_have_to_lie_on_my/,28,"I have a three-year gap on my resume due to my ED. I did absolutely nothing professional during that time. This year is my first time taking a full class schedule in college since then and I've been doing a lot of extracurriculars to make up for it. However, when I applied for an internship, the lady said she was concerned that I couldn't handle it only after asking about what I've been doing since 2018 (first she said I was qualified...). I honestly didn't think people cared about resume gaps. 

So, I emailed the person who helps with internships at my college and she said that they sounded negative and were focusing on the negative. She said that I should just say I had personal issues that are ""fully resolved."" She also said ""OF COURSE you can handle it!"" Honestly, it triggered me to hear that. My ED is not fully resolved. It never will be. And tbh I don't know if I can handle it. With EDs and other illnesses, it's impossible to know how I'll be in a few weeks or how I'll manage situations. So, am I just supposed to lie, I guess? Is it not acceptable to have ""chronic"" illnesses and work? Isn't that discrimination if a place won't hire you due to ongoing illness? 

I'm an honest person and I hate professionalism. I hate stigma. Fuck that. I have an ED and I'm can't recover, but I do need experience. I want to go on a whole rant about how the person hiring is making me feel like a burden and that accommodations are not a bad thing. I want to say, ""how am I supposed to live? I couldn't work due relapse and recovery. I failed at recovery. Now I am trying to at least have a life along with my ED. How am I supposed to do that if no one will hire me because of it?"" I want to tell her that it won't be resolved but someone has to give me a fucking chance. I want to print out articles on adulthood EDs and the inaccessibility of recovery and slap them on her desk. Yes, my ED makes things difficult. It causes brain fog and physical fatigue. It makes me moody. It makes me anxious and depressed. But I have positive qualities, too. & how is it any different than someone with a developmental disability being told they can't handle something? I truly wish that I have a purely physical genetic condition so that I wouldn't be blamed for my problems and it'd be less acceptable to discriminate (ofc that still happens a lot, esp. under the radar).  

Anyway, I have an interview with them soon. I expect that I will burst into tears, and that will just further tarnish my reputation in the professional world. How do you all manage this? Does anyone relate to feeling discriminated and like a burden? I feel like jobs truly aren't meant for people with mental illnesses, but *especially* EDs.",1637149368.0

trying to cope with the stress of seeing a doctor and don’t know what to do,4,qw0vxw,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/qw0vxw/trying_to_cope_with_the_stress_of_seeing_a_doctor/,1,"so my girlfriend has been telling me for months that she’s concerned about me and has been begging me to go see a doctor. 
I finally let her make me a doctors appointment last week, and my appointment isn’t until the end of December. I have not seen a doctor in at least five years and I have extremely bad anxiety about it, to the point where I will travel 2 hours to see my family chiropractor if I’m desperate for an appt. I also haven’t been to the dentist in a while and my teeth have been hurting lately and I don’t know what to do, I feel like I can only do one thing at a time. 

I know I need at least therapy, but I don’t feel like I need medical intervention right now. I’ve been maintaining a healthy weight for the last six months, although my behaviors are still there, they are not as extreme as they once were. 

I have so many worries about it and I want to try to list them because in conversations with my gf, I can’t even express why I get so upset and start crying when I think about this upcoming appointment. 

1.	i’ve never met this doctor and she has no idea of my family history, I don’t know her she doesn’t know me so there’s that. 
2.	right now I’m a healthy weight, I look healthy, I can act healthy, but I know I’m not. I have constant stomach pain, constant nausea whether I’ve eaten or not, and I can’t take it anymore. I’m worried they’ll just prescribe nausea pills that I can’t even afford and give me the whole “you know better” talk and send me on my way. 
3.	I’m worried that because of the above reason, they will see no issue and completely dismiss my experience because I definitely don’t look like I have an ED, i just look like someone who was once obese and is now not, and in any dr’s eyes, that’s a win that will receive encouragement. 
4.	I’m also worried that in between now and then I will either get worse, or stay the same. I’m also worried I will get better? I know it doesn’t make sense but I’m somehow convincing myself I will magically heal and the appointment will be for nothing. i’m worried that no matter what state i am in when i go, that it will be a waste of time and money. 
5.	I don’t even know what to say to them when I go. the appointment is (technically) just to establish a new PCP but obviously my gf wants me to tell them about the ED during the visit. I don’t know what to tell them, the last time i was in a dr setting was in december 2020 when I went to the emergency dept to receive fluids and get a ct scan because i had a migraine for the first time and i thought i was dying. i wanted to say something then, but I couldn’t bring myself to say it out loud. i just cried and the dr laughed at me and then left. it was extremely discouraging and my behaviors continued to get worse after. 

I’m so worried about this appt and was doing alright the last couple months but in between making the appointment and today, I’ve hit a new LW and have no motivation to be better about my habits because what’s the point. i feel like i have to get worse for them to see my struggle and I know that’s not reasonable but i can’t help it. 
this disorder makes me feel childish and so immature but I just can’t stop agonizing about how this meeting will go. 

any advice would be helpful and very much appreciated. i don’t know how to express all of this to my gf without breaking down and just going silent and I really want her to see that I’m trying",1637160550.0

What do you do when treatment teams have consistently failed you?,36,qtot4m,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/qtot4m/what_do_you_do_when_treatment_teams_have/,7,"I've been suffering from a restrictive ED for quite a while and I'm at my wits end. I wanna recover but I don't know how and I feel like I have no options left at this point.

I've sought therapy quite early into my ED, right after my initial honeymoon phase. The first therapist was a complete disaster - I quit right away as soon as he started mentioning the relationship with my parents and implying that it had something to do with my ED. I was disgusted. My parents are the best and whoever brings them into this kind of discussion needs to just fuck off.

In the meantime I had a dietitian. Among other things, he told me to stick to semi skimmed milk at breakfast because it's healthier. I used to drink full fat milk at breakfast even deep into my ED - never done it since.

So then after other attempts I ended up having another therapist, which is the one I currently have. He's nice and we have a much better relationship - he immediately ""clicked"" to me and I felt like he understood. He helped me a lot in many non-ED aspects of my life and seriously improved my well being by doing some hard work on issues that I wasn't even truly aware I had. So that was good.

However, he never helped me when it comes to my ED. Because he, like others, makes it about ""a need for control"". Which to me has always sounded like a pop psycho 90s trope that needs to die already. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's true for a lot of people, but it's not true for me - I've never felt that way. I've always felt out of control with my ED. I don't feel ""in control"" when restricting, I just feel crazy and unhinged. What I personally believe is, it's mostly just a biological drive that got out of hand. But when I tried to explain this to him and have an honest conversation about it, he repeatedly shut me off condescendingly like I was some kind of ignorant fool who had read too much quack science online instead of trusting the professionals. Because apparently his idea that my ED is about control is based on science...?

Also, he got me in touch with another dietitian. A big name in the field, who has worked with treatment centers for decades. He prescribed me ""structured meal plans"" with ""controlled portions of food"". I did tell him that I couldn't understand how that would help me given how my ED was all about ""controlled portions of food"". He said that he couldn't just let me eat what I wanted because you know, binging is bad! So in the end I pretty much just gained weight and nothing changed mentally. And I could write a whole book about all the questionable things he told me, like scolding me for eating one and a half portion instead of just one.

And so I got stuck. Because their explanations and methods didn't make sense. Ultimately it got me nowhere and I just got worse and worse because I felt even more hopeless and lonely. At this point I even wonder if I do have an Ed at all - because apparently I do not feel or behave the way people with EDs are supposed to feel/behave...? 

I did try. I made an effort to be cooperative, to question myself and wonder if maybe it wasn't just my ED trying to sabotage the whole process to keep thriving, and that maybe I simply had to trust the professionals and let go. But after years of this I'm tired of it. They need to take responsibility. They cannot just dismiss their failure to help the patient as the patient himself being uncooperative and resistant. I hate I don't get listened to, essentially get treated like an idiot who's never to be trusted and always get ""explanations"" that I could have easily come up with by reading some random cookie cutter website online. It's just too easy. 

A few days ago I got told by my therapist that maybe the reason why my life has improved in so many ways but my ED is completely out of control is because I cling to the ED since letting go of that would no longer mean I have a ""sick identity"". I basically cried on the spot - not because I was moved, but because I felt offended. I felt offended that ANYONE would think I associate my ED with my identity or that somehow I *want* it. This is not me. This is an illness. An illness that I want to get rid of ASAP. It embarrasses me that I have it honestly, I pray every day that people don't realize because I'd be so ashamed. Don't you dare telling me I have a ""sick identity"".

Ironically, my parents are the only ones that have been able to help me so far. They've always kept it simple, strapping down all the overcomplicated psychobabble and telling me to just eat and everything will fall into place again. It's great but obviously they are also humans and get tired of dealing with my illness all the time. Plus I live far away on my own and even if we did live together they know trying to control me wouldn't work - I'm an adult.

And centers will obviously not work. I cringe just thinking about having to sit there with someone prescribing me exchange-based meal plans and a fist of carbs at lunch while being surrounded by other sick people like me with whom to exchange tips and tricks. Please keep me away from that place.

I'm so tired. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna ""settle down"" and just accept that I'll have an ED forever. I wanna recover and I wanna do it fast. And I wanna recover for real - not just ""get better"", not ""have thoughts but I manage somewhat"". But I'm also at the end of my rope and I feel I'll have to take my own life at some point because I can't put up with this much longer.",1636892825.0

I also mourn the person I was and the body I had and the self control I showed myself when I was at my worst. At the start of recovery I had a boyfriend who was frankly wonderful. We broke up because of distance, so there's no hard feelings but I'm also no longer in love with him. 

I miss my ex as a friend, which the new guy knows and understands, but I also miss how he made me feel about my body. He is a very attractive person, but he's a little lanky so he's not everyone's cup of tea. He just got on some level the same kind of insecurity that I have and the way he comforted me felt so genuine and loving. He was so insanely supportive while I was seeking treatment, and for every meal after that he made sure I felt safe. He made sure I knew I was loved, that I was allowed to eat.  I miss believing someone when they said I was beautiful. 

I just got into a new relationship I am really very excited about, with a guy who makes me so happy. He really does make me feel so safe, and so wanted. The issue is that every time we're physical, I can only think about how I look, how my bones don't stick out like they did, how I must feel so much squishier. He says he likes my hips, how they stick out- what if I keep gaining weight? He likes my collarbones, how prominent they are- what if they disappear? 

I think the real issue is that my current boyfriend is a gym rat, he never thinks he's gotten big enough. I love his body and wouldn't care if he got bigger or smaller, but he's constantly eating. Constantly. He expects me to eat with him, I can't always do that. He's so hyperaware of what I eat and what I don't, and I know on some level that he's not judging but I'm so terrified about keeping up with him. I know he's not meaning to pressure, and he doesn't understand the severity of what I just came out of. I know his comments on my body are supposed to be reassuring. I'm terrified that the personality he has feelings for is less important than the remnants of years of starvation. I know this is awful but his ex is so much tinier than I am.

So I've been ""in recovery"" for about a few weeks now. I put it in quotes because it's almost a forced recovery since I moved and my family has been eating out a lot lately. It's also been way too hard to figure out calories lately (because of school and moving) so I decided this was a good time to recover.

My mental health is a dumpster fire.

About a month ago, I relapsed pretty severely into restricting. For the first time in a long, long time, I'm losing weight. Pretty quickly. But it's all consuming. And I feel ridiculous even calling it a relapse after such a short period of time, but it was sudden, severe, and like a switch flipped in my brain, and it's been an overwhelming constant ever since.

I was trying to think about what life would be like when I hit a healthy weight. Or eventually my goal weight. And it's still just total shit. 

Having to actively worry about everything that goes into my mouth. Forever. Like still having to eat ridiculously small portions to maintain even a healthy weight. Constantly being surrounded by food I can't just indulge in. Never getting to relax about food because I know how slippery of a slope it is for me.

It's not like BED was any better. There's still that being entirely controlled by food. Obsessing over which food I was craving, spending money I shouldn't on binges, feeling powerless to stop eating, NEEDING to eat any time I was stressed (spoiler alert - I'm ALWAYS stressed), and gaining so much weight I became invisible. 

And it's like - shit. My life is always going to revolve around food. I'm always going to have a shitty relationship with it. And I have to be around food for the rest of my life. No matter what I do, it will never, ever get better.

And it's just... really depressing.

I'm not an idiot. I know it's affecting me. I know it's affecting my family. I know my husband is worried. I know my daughter sees it. I just can't stop. It's like a sick game at this point, and even though I know I'll never win, I keep trying to. I see that number on the scale go down and get a brief moment of euphoria. If I see it go up, I'm on edge all day. 

I'm just venting. I just want someone to acknowledge that they understand. I've tried to explain it to my husband but he's a naturally stick-thin guy who can eat whatever he wants and never gain weight, so he literally can't understand. 

I just feel alone. And tired.",1635777933.0

It happened pretty much as soon as I hit underweight BMI and was like a switch had flipped. Every day I tell myself I will get it under control today and won’t binge but by the evening I am shovelling junk food into my face once again.. needless to say I have regained all the weight. 

I feel so desperate and out of control. I went on the waitlist for treatment months ago (back when I was still restricting lol) but haven’t heard anything. I have no friends or family that live anywhere near me, and no real hobbies. All I do is work and then play video games and stuff my face all night. It’s pathetic. I signed up for an expensive gym membership to try to motivate me to be healthier but even on the occasion I do drag myself there I end up binging afterwards. I feel so powerless. 

At this point I just want to end things and feel I have nothing to live for, and the only thing holding me back is that I don’t want my husband to inherit my house (we’re separated) because I’m petty like that. 

I just am at a loss how to pull myself out of this awful cycle of binging because I hate myself and hating myself because of the binging. If anyone has been in a similar place and has any thoughts to share I would be grateful.",1635597470.0

Whaaaaaat the fuuuuuuck. Long vent about emotions.,6,qj5qv4,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/qj5qv4/whaaaaaat_the_fuuuuuuck_long_vent_about_emotions/,1,"Sometime last week I experienced that old familiar feeling of being out of control with my emotions and things going on in my life. As a result, my disordered ass went straight to three different stores to buy safe foods, laxatives, and oversized tops. Oh, and a new SCALE!

According to the anorexic part of me, (I do therapy in which each emotion/behavior has a part it stems from. The anorexic part stems from many different emotions and a need to feel “pure”) I was “doing well” for the first few days since my panic. I was back on my bullshit restricting and over exercising.

My period started as well but sometimes I experience post-menstrual syndrome as appose to regular pre. Period lasted three days and suddenly I was overly emotional and, wait for it…over EATING! Wow! This is still happening and while I’m aware there is a part that is trying to fill some type of unmet need, or using food as a distraction, that combined with period cravings makes any self-forgiveness or compassion impossible.

The past few months I’ve been strength training and finally got some semblance of a booty and have developed a lot of strength which has made me more confident. But when I look in the mirror after binging, I see myself as wildly overweight and the only “good thing” about that is my butt. I think the obsession over that comes from a FWB saying I “need to get an ass” and being more vocal about his attraction towards me since getting one. (I know how bad that sounds, our relationship is a source of extreme anxiety, I’m working on it)

Anyway, I give into the urge to trigger myself looking at old photos of underweight me from this time last year and find a sick, irrational comfort in romanticizing that time even though I was fucking miserable.

Since strength training, I see how strong I feel and look and don’t want to lose that, yet feel so torn between continuing to get stronger and restrict until I’m underweight again. I know the healthy choice, yet I feel like it’s not a choice. I am craving the feeling of “purity” I felt like I was achieving this time last year with my illness, and that feeling only comes from being thin.

I want to shrink away. I want everyone to leave me alone. I don’t want to see anyone. I know what I need to do to take care of myself but I just want to isolate and become sick again. I don’t want that to win over the progress I’ve made but I feel like it will.",1635613459.0

I know I need help, but I'm afraid I'll have to recover again by myself and without any support from my husband.

My ED got really bad a couple years ago. I had relapsed, it lasted for over a year before I asked for help. I don't want to go into too much detail, but it was bad. I only asked for help because I developed a fear of sleep after my brother died. 

My husband had no idea how bad it was. I didn't want to live anymore (another reason I asked for help) and my doctor told my husband not to leave me alone for about a week until my new meds stabilized me. He refused to take time off work, he had just started working there a few months before and he thought taking time off would look bad. He didn't reach out to anyone to see if they could help keep me company. He was fine with leaving me to care for our 2.5 year old alone when I actively wanted to end my life.

They took away my ADHD meds, so my productivity plummeted. After that he frequently guilt tripped me about the clutter in our house. He often said it was affecting his performance at work. 

I tried to be open and honest with him after I asked for help but he never asked me anything relating to my ED. After a few triggering comments that he made, and seeing his confusion when I told him not to say those kinds of things, I asked him if he knew anything about EDs. He said no and agreed to read articles I send him that I think might help. I sent him two short articles and as far as I know he still hasn't read them. 

He came to one of my counseling sessions when I was doing better. My counselor suggested he could help me find recipes and help prep the ingredients, because I wanted to be able to cook again. My anxiety gets bad when I look recipes. He never once helped. I've asked him to find recipes for me more times than I remember over the past two years. It's simply not a priority to him.

I ended up developing a strong dependency on alchohol to cope with recovery. It's better now but he doesn't say anything about it unless I bring it up first. 

There's more but this is long enough already. I know recovery won't work without a good support system. I don't have the energy to educate him and honestly I don't know if that would even work.

TW: >!pro-ana community, meanspo mention, thinspo mention, death mention!<

I have been in a relationship with this girl for a short while but I've known her since we went to school together. We both struggle with restrictive eds and I've been making big progress in recovering, however, I've discovered through one of my friends (who also has a history with an ed) that she has an intense pro-ana account. Along with that, one of her friends also has one and they both share posts with each other. My girlfriend's friend doesn't know that my friend has told me about this situation. My friend and I have discovered vent posts involving us where I have been described almost as thinspo (which makes me feel awful), but in a way where they feel guilty for feeling this way about me. Neither of them know my friend and I have found their accounts, and my girlfriend has no idea that I know she has made another account after I made her delete one in the past (which looking back on it was not the most appropriate method). 

My friend has already brought up the topic of having a serious conversation about this in person with my girlfriend's friend, and my friend is giving the friend time to think about this. 

I know you can't push someone into recovery but I desperately need help or advice on this situation, because I love my girlfriend and want the best for both of them. They're already suffering long-term effects of this heartbreaking illness, and with this relationship between them, I'm afraid they're pushing each other to their own deaths.

My girlfriend can be described as sensitive, shy, quiet and she has very low self-esteem, so I don't want to scare her and make her recede into herself. I think she also has somewhat of a past with therapists but I don't think she trusts medical professionals in general.
How can my friend and I help them? How can we encourage them to recover? Is there anything we can do? What would you say or do in this situation?

Eating has been kinda wonky my whole life, but it first got bad when I was 13 and then really bad at 15.  I was hospitalized, spent months in treatment. I was stubborn the whole time. I dug in my heels. I played games and tricked my family whenever I could. I lied a lot. Went back to treatment at 17, then again at 19, then again at 20. Treatment really isn’t designed to help adults. People think EDs are a teenaged girl thing. When they persist beyond that, people begin to give up hope that you’ll ever get better.

Now, all my social media is split two ways: people I met in treatment who recovered as teens and moved on and have lives, and miserable adults who are still consumed by eating disorders. I wish I was the first one, but I’m not. The whole process of weight restoration and recovery from anorexia is so shit it’s kind of unbearable. More than anything I wish I just gave it a damn chance the first go-around, because then I wouldn’t have to suffer again and again and again and again.

There is SO MUCH FOOD in this house. I can't stand it. I'm never hungry because I'm always obsessing over the food in the kitchen. Looking at it in secret. Eating it in secret. Binging heavily. Doing my best to purge everything but failing, so it's really destroying what self worth I had. 

I lost some weight in my previous country. I was happy with it. Now I realize again how tightly my self worth is tied to how I feel about my body and how much food I'm putting into it. It's fucking depressing. 

I weighed myself. I've gained weight. I feel sick about it. I need to get out of here. 

Every night I think to myself ""okay seriously, this has got to end. Starting now. No more binging. Starting tomorrow, eating better. I got this."" and then I wake up the next morning and as soon as food touches my lips it's over and I'm a ravenous monster. Except I'm not ravenous physically, only mentally.

18 years ago, I was relapsing into anorexia after a semi-recovery (against my will). I left the hospital in May, after 6 months there, I had a first relapse during the summer, with one week of inpatient. Then I tried to stabilize the situation: I didn’t want to gain weight or recover, but I didn’t want to go back to the hospital. Everybody, family, doctors and me, were out of patience and I wanted to go back to school in September and reintegrate the “normal” life with studies, people, etc.

I tried, but ED are not controllable, I was stuck into anorexia mindset, my weight was very low, so my physical and mental health were miserable. I had a doctor appointment every two weeks, but the one I should have to go to in mid-october was postponed and was at the end of the month. I was relieved since I didn’t want to go anyway and also because I had lost some weight since the last appointment and was under the weight limit for inpatient care. So having one more week before the appointment was an opportunity to do some damage control and try to gain a few kilos to avoid being hospitalized.

But 18 years ago, in the morning, the scale gave a number way lower than expected. I lost more than I thought, whereas I didn’t do anything in particular. I was afraid because a sudden loss at this level isn’t a good sign. I was afraid because I felt that my body was giving up. I was afraid because I knew that sometimes, during the night, my mother woke up and opened the door of my bedroom to check if I was still alive. I was afraid because I knew things were out of control. I was afraid because I would have to go back to the hospital and miss another school year. I was afraid because it was a dead end. Literally.

I was afraid. I was febrile. I felt the need to eat. I had to eat. And I eat. Several Kinder Bueno, Mars and Twix bars. It was the first binge. It was exactly 18 years ago. Then I wasn't able to stop, the binges quickly became daily and it was awful, a different kind of awful than anorexia, but still unbearable. My weight/BMI doubled in a few months until I reached my highest weight ever. I was suffocating because of the disgust and hate of myself, I was very suicidal. But the doctors didn't really care anymore since my weight was okay, despite the suspicious speed of the gain. And my parents chose to close their eyes on it since I wasn't on the verge of dying at any moment anymore.

I certainly don't want to go back there, it was dreadful. Things are not great today, but at least it's more manageable, I learned to live with binge eating disorder, I've been able to limit their impact on my life, to stabilize the situation at a correct level where I'm functional. They're still very present, but now I can have a life outside of them, a husband, a life, some activities and interests non-ED related which is very relieving.

There's no point to this text, it's just that this birthday came to mind when I saw the date, and it reminded me of things...",1635083387.0

Eating disorders are sometimes ALSO metabolic/endocrine disorders and not JUST psychiatric ones: story of a friend,62,qdyjlh,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/qdyjlh/eating_disorders_are_sometimes_also/,8,"I crossposted this from [r/BingeEatingDisorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/)

Hello,

**TL;DR;** Binge eating (and other eating disorders) is sometimes ALSO a metabolic/endocrine disorder and not JUST a psychiatric one and restoring metabolic health can help tremendously with recovery

A friend of mine suffered from extreme BED since she was 13. This, among other things, caused her to be morbidly obese and she also developed PCOS.

She was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward twice (self-admitted). Despite all the therapy and meds, she was never able to control the disorder, because she just could not fight against the urges to binge.

I myself am a final year medical student (Central Europe). After talking to her, she told me that she gets these intense cravings randomly throughout the day. I thought, well, maybe we can tackle this from the metabolic side (in addition to her going to therapy).

So I suggested she should talk to her physician in order to get a prescription for metformin (insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic medication) and an SGLT2-inhibitor (causes around 100g of carbohydrates to be lost via the urine every day). The metformin ER (2g/day) + the empagliflozin (12.5mg/d) helped with the metabolic dysregulation by counteracting the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is also one of the main factors that causes overweight individuals to be very hungry, because the stored adipose tissue (fat) cannot be tapped into, because the high levels of insulin inhibit lipolysis (fat breakdown). This causes people to become very hungry quite soon after eating.

Furthermore, I cleaned up her diet. We settled on a paleo-like diet with slow-release carbs with low glycemic index (e.g. beans, peas, sweet potatoe, other veggies), plenty of good fats (olive oil, butter, avocado), and protein. We removed fast-spiking carbs (e.g. bread, pasta, potatoes, etc.) and milk products (as whey and casein -the milk proteins- have some endocrine activity and can lead to inflammation and cravings due to their synergizing effects on insulin as well as IGF1 -a hepatic growth factor).

Well, low and behold, after 2 weeks of ups and downs, she did not have one single binge in over 5 months. Her weight loss is in the image. Currently, she sits at 75kg and is still losing and binge free. (The story as well as the screenshot below is of course posted with her permission).

The therapy (targeting the psychological side of things) was ineffective until also the metabolic/endocrine side of things was addressed -after which both components worked synergistically.

While binging often has a large psychological component (addiction, stress-eating), there is also an endocrine/metabolic/internistic component (e.g. intense craving due to metabolic dysregulation) -which is often neglected by many doctors.

I just want to share her journey as well as encourage some of you to talk to your physician to tackle the metabolic side of things, because, if the *physiological* craving is eliminated, controlling binges is a lot easier.

**Moral of the story:** BED has sometimes ALSO a metabolic/endocrine component and not JUST a psychiatric one. And this metabolic/endocrine component (i.e. *one* of multiple factors) could either be a contributing cause or a disorder-maintaining consequence of BED. Nonetheless, whether cause or consequence, it can be targeted with specific medical interventions, which should/could help tremendously with recovery (esp. in subjects whose eating is triggered by hunger pangs and not purely due to stress/coping, etc.)

Bonus: Instead of the empagliflozin, even more effective would be a GLP1-agonist (e.g. liraglutide), which is both an insulin sensitizer, slows stomach emptying (--> less hunger pangs), as well as activates POMC-neurons in the hypothalamus (--> greater and prolonged satiety and greater energy levels). In the near future, she will likely switch out the empagliflozin for the liraglutide. An excerpt of a study regarding the use of GLP1-agonists in BED is shown below.

I feel bad for posting this, when a lot of people are going through a tough time.

Through a combination of new counselor, new dietician, and hormone therapy, I've somehow turned a corner.

My Ed behaviors have decreased a lot. And I don't feel like I'm being tortured every second.

I didn't find most of Ed treatment very helpful, but the parts about authenticity and ""using your voice"" do seem to be part of my current progress. I got in the ring and fought like hell for myself to get testosterone, to find a trans/intersex informed counselor, to get a better job, to get better more informed doctors, and to be honest with my friends. It was not easy and had a lot of costs. But overall, I think it was worth it.

Also, if anyone says you are treatment resistant or beyond hope, that's their projection and their insecurities. I think that I can improve a lot. Maybe not be 100% cured, but I can be much better. The providers who said otherwise to me were dead wrong. Yes I've had an ed for 30+ years but that doesn't mean I'm beyond help. They didn't have the skills or knowledge to see what I needed, so I had to figure it out on my own.",1634909975.0

I've always struggled with food since a young age, like 7-8 but always thought it was normal after seeing it was how my mother ate as well, and poverty was a factor. 

My first true ""realization"" was in high school, when I dramatically lost weight and I confessed to my friends I might have an ED. One gave me the ""up-down look"" and blurted out that I was too fat to have an ED before stomping off and never speaking to me again. My second, was in my university courses and after battling severe nausea from the change in food and concerned roommates dragging me to meals which then caused what I call mechanical purging. I had a third relapse in senior year, the second most severe, and the most severe after I graduated and was living in my own looking after both my parents houses while my step dad was in hospital all the while I was working two jobs. 

I was diagnosed AN-B/P subtype in 2018 following a migraine hospitalization. I talked about it with my old psychiatrist, but he says ""it's not severe enough"" and we never talked about it in depth. I never seen him again. I've been waiting over a year for a new psychiatrist. 

I've never been inpatient. I've never been skelly, just UW. Hearing or seeing other people my height and seeing their weight or hearing their stories has been super triggering me lately and makes me wonder if I ever even had an ED or if it's just ""food problems with occasional purging and added bonus weight loss"".

\-I'm either gorgeous or hideous.

\-I aim for full recovery or I give up. I'll be recovered or I'll relapse (quasi recovery never sticks for me...always ends up being a full-blown relapse).

I have struggled with disordered eating since about 14, not diagnosed. I've never been that worried about it because it always felt like a switch. The self hatred was always there but I could turn off the bad eating habits so I always felt safe. But about a year ago with everything happening in the world I fell into a deep depression and oddly enough for the first time in my life started working on NOT hating myself in an effort to lessen the heaviness that had sunk in.

I've gotten to the point where I do now love my body, even if only for what it is and what it does and not always how it looks (because that is a constantly changing and worthless value point). I have compassion and no longer tie my self worth to weighing less. Yet I can't stop losing weight now, food has no joy or taste. Before it almost had a kind of forbidden tabbo that would honestly help me get back into sustainable caloric intake. But I've been allowing myself to eat anything I want, for the first time I placed no restrictions of safe and unsafe food, I mentally made everything just fuel. How could learning to love my body as it is end up making my eating habits worse!!! It's so unfair, I've spent the better part of a miserable year stopping self harming and stopping the negative thoughts. I've changed my whole mentality through months of constant work and I'm rewarded with the inability to enjoy food since I took away the negativity.

Now all I see is a shrinking small body, I refused to see the smaller body as good or bad but for the first time in my life I'm scared. I've tried multiple times to 'flip the switch' back to healthy eating and it just won't stick. I'm tired, tired of constantly having to eat and re wire my thoughts. I'm tired of thinking about my body, I've been thinking about it every day for over a decade. I thought once I embraced self love my problems would be solved but somehow I made it worse.

Now I don't know what to do, I refuse to go back to the self hatred of before unless it's a last resort, but how can THAT be the better answer. I want to start running and working out again but I can't risk losing more weight. I feel lied to, I'm finally doing everything right and NOW I can't stop losing weight!

I’ve fluctuated from underweight to slightly overweight in my 32 years. What I’ve come to find is different for me is that food is not the root of any of my obsessive, disordered behaviors, my weight and size are. 

I don’t believe I have body dysmorphic disorder, because from what I understand, people with BDD believe they look fat no matter how much weight they lose. This is not the case for me, but I do know exactly what weight range I look best at, what weight I have to be for my thigh gap to appear, which clothes will fit me loose or tight at any given weight, etc. etc. I know these things down to the pound and I am obsessed with staying within a 2-3 pound range of my “ideal” weight. And my personal ideal weight for myself is actually at the lower end of the healthy range based on BMI, so it’s not like I even want to be underweight.

I notice a lot of people talk about “fear foods” or “safe foods”, and it just seems like food is the object of obsession, along with weight loss, but again, that’s not true for me. If I was granted one wish tomorrow, I’d wish to be able to eat anything I wanted and not gain weight. Meticulous planning and obsessing around food is all secondary to not wanting to gain weight. 

And then I think to myself, we’ll that’s normal. EVERYONE wants to stay at their ideal weight and many people eat accordingly to get there and stay there. What I feel defines my behavior as disordered is the way it consumes my life and rules me. I have been bedridden and catatonic with depression from gaining a pound. I am euphoric when I see that number drop, or when a pair of jeans that were previously tight slip on like a glove. I feel like I live and die by the scale. I am a slave to the scale. Hell, I take my scale with me on vacation. When I gain weight, I truly feel like I am a disgusting person, not worthy of love or happiness. All of my other worries and stressors feel so much heavier. When I lose weight, I feel like the world is my oyster and I can do anything. And it’s exhausting and some days I just wonder if this is ever going to end. Am I ever going to be truly happy and able to just enjoy my life without worrying that every bite I put into my mouth is making my jeans tighter.

I tried to recover.,14,q25ckl,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/q25ckl/i_tried_to_recover/,6,"I did. I really tried. For over two months. I wanted to do it for the sake of my partner and children. I knew I was never truly present for them. I feared my teenage daughter would pick up on my behaviours. So I tried. I wanted to recover. But nobody (except my partner) wanted it too. I thought that if I just admitted I had an eating disorder, my wider family would encourage me wholeheartedly to eat more and gain weight. I thought they would say, “It doesn’t matter how much you gain, the most important thing is that you are no longer obsessing over food and that allows you to be a whole person and a better mother”, or words along those lines. But they didn’t. My mum was “concerned” about my weight gain. My mother-in-law kept suggesting different diets I could try. 

I really tried to stick to my recovery but bad luck came in threes. Firstly, I got a leg injury, which meant I couldn’t exercise, and that was the one thing making me feel safe to eat. Secondly, my partner started a diet. She has every right to do that, she doesn’t have an ED, why should she hold back on her own weight/shape goals just because I do have an ED? And thirdly, I visited my in-laws last weekend, and once again got advised to count calories or join Slimming World. And just like that, a switch flipped, and I was out of recovery mode and back in restriction mode. 

I feel trapped in an awful nightmare. I now know the truth of just how much I will gain if I eat without restrictions (a hell of a lot). But I also know that restricting makes me withdraw from my partner and children, and puts my daughter at risk of an eating disorder. I know now that I will never be able to eat in a relaxed way again, without uncontrollable weight gain. I’ll never be able to just spontaneously pop out for a coffee and a cake, or an ice cream, etc. Every calorie that goes into my mouth will have to be planned for, accounted for, made up for, forever. It feels like such hard work.  But I realise now that if I just let myself off from all that pressure, people around me will find my size unacceptable. I can’t walk around wearing a big badge that says, “I’m recovering from an ED, please don’t advise me to diet”. People will just look at my size and judge me.

I’m 40, my disorder started in my early thirties, I don’t have a diagnosis. Maybe that’s partly why people could never take it seriously. Obviously I realise how privileged and blessed I am that I’ve never been seriously physically ill from my ED. But it does seem to make people believe it isn’t real. I know it’s real and my partner knows it’s real because we both saw how much our lives changed when I tried to recover. I was able to think about things other than food, I was able to plan our days around things other than food. I enjoyed time with my family downstairs rather than counting the minutes/hours til I could go to bed and hide away from food. Now my partner says I am looking at her “through the glass” again.

I hate photos.,10,q1yyoc,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/q1yyoc/i_hate_photos/,1,"I *know* I am at an 'acceptable' or 'healthy' weight, ideal for my height. I have *known* this, objectively, since I was 13 or so. However, the ED pushes me to often believe that I am large, too much, unacceptable, chubby, etc. and I become convinced that everyone around me also believes that I am not thin enough, not good enough. I'm sure this is a common mindset among many of us on this sub, the crux of our collective disorders. The countless hours of therapy I have sat through have barely dented this mindset and at this point I have pretty much accepted it as a part of my day-to-day reality.

Another thing I struggle with that is not so common: I hate photos to the point of complete avoidance. In a selfie 'share everything' culture, I feel so far on the outside. I deleted social media because it depressed me to feel so overwhelmingly uncomfortable that I couldn't share my life the way other people do. I am envious of anyone who can post photos of themselves without thought, without going back to look at the picture a thousand times only to decide you hate it & go on to delete its existence completely.

There have been many experiences I wish could have been recorded with a picture but I was too afraid to see myself. I have panic attacks occasionally & sometimes just thinking about having my picture taken makes me so nervous I begin to not want to attend the event entirely. I was a bridesmaid a few months ago for my sister-in-law & I obsessed over how big my arms were going to look in the sleeveless dress so much I thought I would explode with anxiety (luckily the party was informal enough that I was able to keep a cardigan on). I am generally 'okay' & 'recovered' in every day life but when it comes to pictures - I crumble.

Yesterday my partner & I received keys to our new home - a big deal (...but I've kind of been trying to numb myself out about the whole situation because FEELINGS). The real estate agent, happy for us but also wanting to market her work, asked to take a picture of us in front of our house. I like her a lot but immediately felt the pang of anxiety at the prospect of my photo being taken. I felt like I couldn't say no because it's such a 'normal' thing to do and I knew it would be a whole thing. She took the photo, texted it to us, and posted it on her real estate instagram account. 

Just her texting the photo to me made me have two reactions: 1) Oh, I guess I *am* a lot smaller than my partner (knowing they're five inches taller & xxlbs heavier wasn't enough) & 2) I guess this is an okay-acceptable photo. 

Then, this morning, seeing that she posted it on IG immediately makes me want to disappear. I stare at it through the eyes of strangers & I think 1) my thighs are two big 2) my pants are ugly 3) that sweater makes me look like I have a belly 4) my face is ugly 5) my hair looks stupid, etc. I also sometimes have this kind of thing come up when family or friends take pictures & post photos of me. Again, I don't have an IG account, but I suspected she was posting it & felt compelled to seek it out. Maybe on some level I wanted to trigger myself??? I honestly don't know. I mostly just know that I feel like an unacceptable piece of shit.

Does anybody else truly struggle with this? I literally attempted to make myself & my image disappear from the internet by deleting all of my social media accounts. I thought at first it was good for my mental health to avoid such triggers, but I admit to feeling left out of things. However, going back to social media seems incredibly overwhelming. I just feel quite isolated & like there's nothing I can do to feel better about the situation. I am a grown ass woman in a supportive relationship with a good job and I just bought my first house - yet one photo can make me feel like trash.

"Struggling with new job / change in general, how do I cope?",3,q1z7a6,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/q1z7a6/struggling_with_new_job_change_in_general_how_do/,7,"Recently I got my first job in 4 years! I stopped applying about 3 years ago because I wasn't getting anywhere, then applied to this place 3 weeks ago, got an interview 4 days ago, and then got offered the job on the spot. I'm so excited.

However, the only reason I applied is because I've relapsed into a restrictive ED. It's what makes me feel like I have worth. It's not a physical job but it is something where I can't be close to fainting every time I stand up...but each time I've gone in I've been so nervous I haven't been able to eat at all. Every time I have to email them, I get so nervous that I can't eat for hours just to be able to work up the courage to respond. I haven't even started yet, we're just sorting out the paperwork so I *can* start. I'm an emotional person and the restriction takes a lot of it away so that I can stop being paralyzed by fear and shame.

Every time I think about recovery, I find an excuse not to because I'm too scared of losing the only thing that motivates me to make positive changes in my life.

Also, even without stress, I don't have an appetite. Eating is a chore that I procrastinate. I count calories just to hit >!1200!<. If I don't keep track of everything or get lazy, I only eat >!300-600!< a day. When I told a doctor this, she just said that she wished she had that problem. Another doctor I spoke to said that if it was still happening in 6 months then I should come back to have it looked into. If I'm still eating like this in 6 months I don't think I'd be able to hold down a conversation, let alone a job. Do I have to be underweight before it's concerning?? That's what it feels like. I had this problem when I was younger too. It was 'cured' (binge eating) when I went on the pill, and I came off it 7 months ago and immediately went back to being disgusted by food. Clearly something is wrong and no one cares anymore now that I'm a healthy BMI, even though I was an obese BMI not that long ago. Doctors only cared when I was underweight.

In conclusion, I have no hunger cues, my ED is what motivates and calms me, and I need to eat so that I don't faint on the job and get fired but I don't know that I'd be mentally well enough to hold down a job if I'm not numbing my mental illnesses with a different mental illness. Does anyone have any advice? If not, thanks for reading. The venting has made me feel a bit better lol",1633448887.0
Partner gets angry about ED stuff,28,q1b8kx,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/q1b8kx/partner_gets_angry_about_ed_stuff/,7,"I'm feeling confused and overwhelmed, but hopeful. Any feedback or support would be great, I don't feel comfortable talking about this with my support system in real life so this forum is super helpful.

So, my partner gets pretty upset whenever she thinks I'm losing weight or restricting. Which obviously is very stressful for both of us. For context, I'm not underweight or anywhere close, never have been, and my physical health is good. I often don't agree with what my partner notices. For example, she says I look skinnier, and gets mad if I turn down food. So the next day I weigh myself, and I'm the same weight as always. I tell her that, and she gets upset about me weighing myself, and says she doesn't believe that I am actually the same weight.

I feel confused, like I can't trust either myself or her on this stuff. I know my ED causes skewed perception, and there have been plenty of times in the past when I didn't pick up on disordered stuff until I was already sliding into a relapse. However, once I catch it, I always bounce back. But also, I do think she overreacts at times.

She says she has a tough-love approach because I need to know my behavior isn't good, and that she won't let it slide. She thinks that my ED stuck around so long because my loved ones ignored or implicitly approved of it (which may be true idk).

I've told her that these conversations aren't productive and I need autonomy in my recovery. She sees my request for autonomy as wanting to distance myself so I can engage in ED behaviors again. She is afraid that I will choose my ED over her. It came out recently that her anxiety comes from seeing trusted people ""transform"" in the past due to addiction or mental health issues, and put her in danger or hurt her (literally).

Additionally, she struggled with bulimia for a while in the past, and recovered on her own through basically a ""tough love"" mentality towards herself. When we talked, she understands our situations are different and we're different people, but I guess she has that ""if I can do it, so can you"" mentality a bit.

Finally yesterday I think she started to see that she needs to address her issues, too. We started reading this book about helping a loved one through recovery from addiction (but a lot of it could apply to an ED too). The book mentioned several things on both of our ""sides"", so I think we both felt like it was proving us ""right"".

I'm hopeful that we're getting closer to supporting instead of fighting each other, and being a united front against both of our issues. I sympathize with my partner's anxiety. But I'm also stressed and tired, and tired of defending myself.",1633371098.0

I'm a teacher and I focused all of my summer on recovery, only to relapse when the school year started (which has been complete chaos). My schedule was not developed or made functional until this week (week 3) which had included some discrepancies with my lunch break; Im assigned to two schools, and some days I travel from one school to the other on my lunch. This means that I'm given maybe 20 minutes to eat, go to the bathroom, and prep for my five afternoon classes (without any breaks in between them). The rest of the week, I'm teaching 8 or 9 classes with a 30 minute lunch, and one 40 minute preparation period (one of the days I don't get that 40 minute break, though). While this seems okay, my job is physically and mentally draining, and requires a lot of planning. Guess what I do instead of eat because I don't have time for the other things? 

Teaching is all I know but I'm 30 and I feel my ED catching up with me. I've resorted to having energy drinks and bottled smoothies during the day because it's the only thing that I can feasibly ingest while wearing a mask and keeping mask hygiene. I can stealth sip with a mask, stealth eating isn't quite as easy.

also, add in my coworker showing me photos of her emaciated daughter. she also gave me her height and weight so my brain is just having so much fun with that info right now.

i can’t believe i am allowing the comment to even get to me but it does and when the candy cart was brought around by my boss, I felt like the only option was a tin of altoids.

I have a restrictive ED, purging subtype, not formally diagnosed.

Late last year I started experiencing long hauler Covid symptoms after having very mild Covid last March. I've been to the ER twice, and been seeing a neurologist for the past 6 months. I have been put on so many different meds, it's insane. And every single one of them has been wrong for me.

Just this past week, my Neuro diagnosed me with chronic migraine and prescribed me a new medication. Within a day of taking it, I was essentially non-functional due to drowsiness. I took the meds for 3 days, called to complain and was told to stop, and then went through two days of super intense withdrawal. The meds they put me on were so intense that after only 3 days of taking it, I went through two full days of withdrawal. I'm talking fever, shakes, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, the works. 

Their answer? Prescribe me a different medication. Guess what the side effects are?

Extreme weight loss, mental confusion, slowed heart rate, ketoacidosis, suicidal ideation, kidney malfunction, low blood pressure... The list goes on.

Husband and I decided I'm not taking it yet until we talk to a GP. 

Today we get a bill in the mail for care we've already paid for. Turns out a doctor I saw wasn't actually affiliated with the healthcare network I was seeing, but was a subcontractor, so we owe another $300 on top of the $7000 we're already paying off for me this year.

If you've made it this far, thank you. I'm just feeling so fucking lost and I haven't been able to eat more than a few bites a day for over a week and I'm so tired and lonely. I tried to talk to my husband but he's stressed too and that didn't go well. I'm still recovering from coming off that last med, but I just don't know what to do. I don't want to see any more doctors at this point. They're only going to rake us over the coals financially, prescribe me horrible medication, and not actually fix any of the problems. He thinks me not seeing doctors is the reason we're in this mess. I think this is a great example of why I hate seeing doctors.

No longer than 4 hrs between meals

3 planned meals and 2 or 3 planned snacks per day, ideally planned a day before

No purging

Hunger doesn't dictate when to have food

It's been so hard not purging, not skipping meals and just planning everything. It has literally taken over my days, cooking, packing food, not just for me but for everyone in the house... Dealing with the unpredictability of eating in a social situations. But I did it.

Not gonna lie, my mental state is still not right, but I'm just following the rules. Because the point of this is for me to change my behaviour, and then discover for myself, that hopefully my weight won't fluctuate or increase by a lot. Thennnn we will deal with the feelings that come with that.

Partner's Negative Body Image Affecting my Own,49,pt8030,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pt8030/partners_negative_body_image_affecting_my_own/,7,"My husband has gained some weight over the last couple years. He's uncomfortable in his body, and I get the feeling, but I still think he's sexy and looks good. He keeps making comments about how disgusting he looks, and the rolls on his stomach and how gross his stomach looks and how bummed out he is by his weight gain.

I'm having a hard time hearing all of the comments.

I'm currently obese. I have a history of anorexia and bulimia and was underweight at one point, but currently suffer from binge eating disorder. I started to lose weight again in a healthyish way, but my mental health has been really bad lately, so my stress eating has increased and I gained back the weight I lost.

All I can think is, if he thinks he's gross, God only knows what he thinks of me. 

And, logically, I know that isn't necessarily the case. Plenty of people hate their own bodies and don't extend that hate to the bodies of others.

But my body is a LOT bigger than his. My stomach has several rolls that fold over by themselves even when I stand up straight (which is one of the things where he's like at least my weight gain hasn't gone that far yet, because that's disgusting). And every comment he makes about his weight and body, as well as the weight and body of other people, makes me more and more self conscious around him, as well as increasingly disgusted by myself. Which leads to me binging more, or occasionally binging and purging (adding in that he knows I have a history of eating disorders, but doesn't really get it, and also does not know that I have BED or have started purging again).

I can't even bring this up because he'll get mad at me for ""making it about me"" and not being supportive enough or making it so he can't talk to me or whatever.

So how do I maintain my own sanity while still being supportive of my husband?",1632318780.0

I could hear the guy taking my vitals saying that I seemed ""high as a kite like I take pain pills,"" which I don't I was just not conscious so I was mumbling and almost drooling on myself and praying which I guess praying for God to heal me is also weird to them too. 

They took me in the ambulance and were really rough with me trying to stick an IV in my neck I said please no use my arm please and they did and got it. After that I just let my body lose complete responsiveness to receive the fluids and feel the AC on me and I could hear them saying my Systolic Blood Pressure was 50 and that I was critical. But they were also saying a lot more. 

They said, ""That mother was talking our ear off she was such an anxious mess and what an enabler look at this kid she's skeletal,""
""I would never let my kid be anorexic I beat that boy's ass when I caught him smoking weed once and cut him off from all his friend's, I'd beat my kid til they stopped this,""
""I understand being an alcoholic or doing some drugs to make you feel good but I'll never understand girls and eating disorders they don't even get a benefit from it,""
""This COVID crap is such bullshit I had it for a few days and took Ivermectin and I'm fine,""
""This grown woman is in a diaper, can't imagine college is too fun with that,""
Also talking right-winged conspiracy theories.  I could hear every single word they said, I just couldn't respond. They only said it because they thought I couldn't hear it. 

I am in the hospital now, my blood pressure has improved after 3 bags of fluids (I hate it I'm swollen and bloated as hell). They were able to hold off on a blood transfusion. They said my stool is bloody and believe something has been torn in my GI tract. My electrolytes are almost normal by some miracle. The hospital staff is very nice.

I have restricted since I was a teen until a few years ago, when I finally was able to think about it less. I was at a normal BMI for the first time for an extended period and mostly worried about work. A month or two ago, my friend visited and their body was completely different than when I last saw them, extremely skinny. 

They talked with me extensively about how I am 'skinnyfat' and need to cut carbs out of my diet, and many other things that are now endlessly rattling around in my head. I was always just a calorie restrictor so I never worried about the type of food besides not eating much of it. Now my disorded brain can't even look at carbs anymore. I'm pretty sure the other day I accidentally went into ketosis (had all the symptoms) and I couldn't sleep at all for a couple nights as my body tried to figure out what was going on. 

Because of this, I've relapsed harder than ever, with even more things to obsess over than when it was just simple CICO. I can't even eat bananas or ricecakes anymore, two of my favorite safe foods for breakfast/lunch because they have (in my head) high carbs. I'm super confused and have completely changed what I eat daily, as well as low/medium restricting for about two months now. I wish I had never learned anything about macros, dieting, fitness culture (which I have done my best to avoid because I worried I might react like this) and could just be content with where I was, which was totally healthy.",1632007396.0

Out of the shower. Dizzy. Scared. My chest hurt. My body hurt. I realized I could barely think or get up, let alone prepare food. Like a brat I was crying 'til she got worried and came home. I felt so weak and when she got home I was laying in my bed, undressed, in my bathrobe, under my covers, and had finally fallen asleep genuinely praying she'd be there soon because I didn't want to suffer all alone. I'm a grown woman for Christ's sake. Why am I doing this? She got home and woke me and said, ""Get up,"" I said I couldn't just stay with me. She said, ""I'm pouring you orange juice, you're drinking the juice. I got you juice."" I sipped on it she said what happened, please finish this, you need to eat, what's wrong. I just felt so paralyzed. She's been asking me to go to the hospital for awhile now. She says I need electrolytes, I need someone to take care of me. I said I need therapy, she said ""Your therapist won't see you like this, you are too sick. Maybe Telehealth, but even your therapist would call to get you medical care at this point. She'd have no choice.""

I was hungry. I couldn't think of anything in the house to eat. She said let's get sushi, you like sushi. With rice. You need it. You need it all. I got ready and we went to get sushi. The same server is always there, her name is Amy. She is so nice. She always mentions that I'm a picky eater and tells me to take my time ordering. I have panic attacks constantly and she always is just like, ""No rush, I'll come back, take your time to order."" Tonight Amy was glad to see me it's been awhile. I ordered soup, it was so warm. I ordered some sushi. Amy talks a lot, I've been going there for awhile and she's told me a lot about herself and her life because she has interesting stories about when she came to the US and how she misses Chinatown in New York, which is where I'm from too. 

Tonight she seemed worried about me. She said I don't look so well, I look like I'm not eating much, if I've been to the doctor. I told her I missed my doctor's appointment the other day and had to reschedule. She said, ""Go sooner. Or to the hospital. You need medicine and food, you are having trouble eating, it's dangerous. Your body is probably very sick,"" on the way out she got close to me and said, ""Please come back soon. And try to eat more everyday, you can do it. The food is medicine, it will make you get getter soon."" Her English is a bit broken but you get the drift.

I don’t think anyone has ever truly paid attention to me. Talking to my parents growing up felt like I was talking to a brick wall. It still does when I talk with them. I don’t expect that to change, I’m just used to it at this point.

I’ve always felt like there was a layer of separation between me and other people. It’s like I’m wrapped in plastic trying to reach out, but my own fears and apprehensions and struggles with socialization hinder me greatly, along with the fact that truly I am just not an interesting or remarkable person. I’m never anyone’s first or even second choice, I’m always disregarded to various degrees of severity and I always have been. I’m paraded around like an unwilling jester for everyone in my life so they can make fun of me, talk down to me so they can boost themselves up. I let this happen because I want it. At best any friends I have hate me, at worst they don’t even care or think of me.

I’m paying a therapist now and I realize that I can never change this about myself, my desperate desire to be loved and for people to like me, it fuels almost everything I do. My desire to be wanted coupled with the debilitating terror of being seen. I think I’m only even seeing a therapist at this rate just so there is someone who is witnessing me and has no choice but to listen to me.

But the light at the end of the tunnel always for me is “if I lose weight I’ll be prettier, and then people will love me and want me”. That’s my sole solace and goal, because I just want someone to pay attention to me. People talk to me when they notice I’m losing weight, they tell me I look great. If I keep doing that they’ll keep giving me attention.

I’m too old for this to be my sole motivation and purpose in my life, it’s so pathetic honestly, I’m so pathetic, and that just makes everything worse.",1631633212.0

My brother was not in a good mental and physical state, and I became super worried for his wellbeing. I focused a lot of that energy on to him and my eating disorder used it as an excuse to neglect myself. 

I've had Anorexia Nervosa Purging Subtype (with Laxatives and Exercise) for about ten years. I've been underweight for years and had no room to lose. At first, I just lost some of my appetite naturally due to busyness and fear. I was traveling a lot and being pretty active, eating was just in the back of my mind. 

I was eating a lot of meats and vegetables, and naturally realized that I was consuming less carbohydrates than usual due to accessibility. I decided with my spare-time to begin reading all about the benefits of low-carb diets, joined a Discord, next thing I knew I was completely indoctrinated. This was going to improve my health. It isn't just for weight loss. It can improve insulin levels, reduce anxiety, be good for digestion. It's just so amazing!

So I began.. lots of wings, and salads, than I learned about the sugars in barbecue sauces, next rice was bad, then dried fruit... no more juice. It was like just taking every food I was safely able to eat away from me. 
Eventually I just became petrified of even taking the wrong bite of something. Like, debilitated with fear. Just awful. 

I've lost so much of my appetite and enjoyment for my life and my family. I'm so exhausted. I've lost weight from it all. My dog Lucy died making me even sadder and all I want is to feel okay. The keto-groups are so toxic. One time I fainted and they scolded me for eating a piece of bread after fainting, saying I should've had a keto-option on hand. They blame everything on American food addiction and assume everyone is obese, diabetic, or has a history of binge-eating. Their dialogue surrounding people who eat carbohydrates and who are overweight is so evil and cruel. I hate them.

Question about periods TW: BMI,6,pkums6,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pkums6/question_about_periods_tw_bmi/,9,I stopped getting my period several months ago (last one in late May) while restricting pretty heavily. I am no longer restricting and have been eating at maintenance or slightly above for the last month (BMI 19). My period still hasn’t come back so I spoke to my doctor about it. I didn’t specifically mention ED stuff but explained I’d lost a large amount of weight quite suddenly and thought that was the reason for losing my period. My doctor said it probably wasn’t the reason as you only lose your period generally at a BMI of <18. However they can’t do any tests or help me further until I’ve missed 6 months consecutive periods (this is the NHS in the UK). Now I am worrying that I have PCOS as my skin has been really bad lately and obviously that’s anxiety inducing as one of the main symptoms is weight gain! Is the doctor correct that period loss from sudden weight loss only really happens if you’re underweight? Has anyone else lost theirs from undereating without being underweight and if so how long did it take to come back? Thanks in advance!,1631180891.0
A warning about an indie horror film director under the alasis Lucifer Valentine who (allegedly) goes after young women with EDs.,63,pk7n43,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pk7n43/a_warning_about_an_indie_horror_film_director/,8,"Hello. I already shared this a few months back on here and other subs related to EDs, but I thought it was necessary to post about this topic again in hopes of warning young vulnerable women into his trap.

If anyone here is a horror fan, they might be aware of Lucifer Valentine, a horror director known for his debut film “Slaughtered Vomit Dolls” that found a resurgence in popularity due to being featured on a disturbing movies iceberg. His films center around young women with eating disorders, hence why I thought it was relevant to post here.

People have come forward alleging that he goes after women, most notably damaged young women with eating disorders, and (allegedly) exploits his young and impressionable fans to enact their EDs by purging on camera for him or, according to a YouTube comment, “stop eating”. 

The extreme/transgressive side of the horror genre is already male dominated as it is, so I want to warn all women who may be into horror to steer clear of both this director and his work. 

I encourage everyone to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/hffvUtXe4Y8) created by true crime YouTuber “The Internet Investigator” (which is currently blowing up) and check out the Twitter thread in the description that goes more in depth about accusations from fans stating he exploited their ED.",1631095960.0

A coworker asked if I ate today,26,pk33fw,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pk33fw/a_coworker_asked_if_i_ate_today/,3,"Hey guys, this is my first post on this sub, so I hope I’m doing this right. I just needed to talk a little because I have no one left in my life. My personality and the ED keep me pretty isolated. 


Today I mentioned to a coworker I was tired. As one does, because who isn’t tired at work. It’s a pretty busy job, moving and standing a lot, and I don’t want to mention numbers or specific behaviors, but they then asked if I ate today. They also asked if something was going on because “watching you work was like you were moving in slow motion”. It was sort of out of the blue, they don’t know about my ed, and I don’t feel I look like I have one anymore. Maybe she was just asking because that’s how she shows care, but it caught me off guard. I didn’t even know how to react because no one at work knows yet and I didn’t want anyone catching on. My family knows it’s sort of a “don’t ask, don’t even mention it” sort of thing so hearing it from her felt weird, I almost said “why would you ask me that?” I blanked for a few seconds debating telling her the truth or figuring out what to say I ate, and ended up just nodding my head. I am so glad I was wearing a mask because my facial expression would have given me away.


This is my first official job, and it feels weird. I was doing okay for a little before this, but have started to decline a bit, and I’m scared I won’t be able to keep up at my job or people will watch me decline. What are your guys experiences with physically demanding jobs and relapsing? And experiences with coworkers about your ED? 


I work in the bakery section that is also connected with the bulk section so I’m around food all the time and people will offer it sometimes, and it feels like I am declining their gesture when I say no thank you.

Food never tastes as good as I imagine it being,53,pjr25s,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pjr25s/food_never_tastes_as_good_as_i_imagine_it_being/,2,"I get so fixated about eating a food, how good it will taste, over and over I think and think and think about it, but I can’t eat it. I put off eating it for hours to months, and then whenever I actually eat it, it never tastes as good as I imagine, or how good I recall it tasting in the past. There are so few joys in life, and I’m always devastated every time this happens. Like, comically devastated in ways where it’s triggered an episode of major depression for me in the past, and also really upsets me still.

I’ve come to understand that I do seem to have some issues with tasting food compared to other people when I talk to them, for example white bread tastes like almost nothing to me but other people disagree, some even saying it tastes sweet. The thing is I don’t know if it actually tastes duller to me because of a physical medical issue, if it’s just my chronically depressed brain making things lackluster, or if I mentally play up how little something tastes just to prevent myself from getting enjoyment out of it. I recognize that I often dislike foods that are just okay just so I have an excuse to not eat something I’m not crazy about. I play that up I think, so what if I’m playing up my issues with taste too just for an excuse?

I’ve suffered from binge eating, in fact that’s my default state it feels, because I just binge on the most flavorful rich satisfying foods, and then I have periods of restriction and that’s when this issue always rears it’s head again. I spend all this time fantasizing about eating something, usually something specific, and then when I do, it never feels worth it.

I don’t know what the purpose of typing this all out is, but it’s a thought that’s upset me ever since I started restricting on and off in my teens. I don’t think this is a normal line of thinking and experiences a lot of people have, and it always seems to sound insane to people when I genuinely try to explain myself.",1631033799.0

Acquaintance commented on my weight gain,9,pjqjku,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pjqjku/acquaintance_commented_on_my_weight_gain/,2,"I’m a nanny and the family I worked for moved away in June and I’ve been working with a new family in the same neighborhood. I used to have a set schedule so I knew tons of nannies and their kids at the local park and we’d meet there every single day. My schedule is a little different now but I still frequent the same park and occasionally run into a nanny friend there. I know I’ve gained some weight but I already was gaining weight in the Spring and earlier in the summer so my old nanny friends all saw me gain weight. I recently started a new medication and I guess I’ve gained some more in the last couple months but I honestly didn’t think it was too noticeable or anything.

Today I was at the park with my nanny kid and an old nanny acquaintance of mine rolled up with her kids so we chatted for a minute. We were never super close but we know each other by name and exchanged some small talk about my new nanny family and what we’ve been up to. She then said (in a very nice and friendly tone) “I see you’ve gained some weight!” while pinching her cheeks. I was mortified and just said “haha, yeah” and she said it looked good on me and walked away. 

I already feel myself spiraling right now like why would you ever comment on someone’s weight gain?? She’s an older Jamaican woman so I really don’t think she meant to be rude or hurt my feelings at all. It’s just the fact that she could tell I had gained weight that makes me feel like everyone around me can tell too and is thinking about it. I guess it is obvious because some of my clothes don’t fit anymore but I didn’t really think anyone else would have noticed. It’s only been a little over 2 months since I’ve seen her and so guess I’ve gained a significant amount in that time which scares me.

I’ve gained a ridiculous amount of weight in the past few years. I got careless, I overindulged too many times. What used to be a treat became an average meal. I had been in recovery and actually happy with my body. But I’ve gained xx lbs since then. I’m medically obese.

I’ve been dieting, but it’s been mentally hard and I don’t know why. Part of it is that I’m afraid to be too strict and worry him, so I relax and eat a little more. 

If I purge, I will have to tell him. I can’t keep that a secret and ruin our marriage. I haven’t lost any weight, so I can’t be banned from losing weight yet. But I remember how amazing it was to lose so much weight so quickly…. 

Maybe if I get my shit together, I can start fasting this week. It would be better to restrict instead of eating and purging anyway. And who knows, maybe it’ll just be fasting. Just a diet. I’ve done it before without relapsing. But purging would just be so easy…",1630891030.0

**LONG POST AHEAD. PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME TO READ THIS THROUGH**

I am not diagnosed with an eating disorder ... not officially anyway.

I did however get diagnosed with an ED (anorexia nervosa) about 10 years ago and while I managed to get a hold of this puzzling battle, there are a few symptoms and temptations that still linger. It only lasted for maybe 2 to 3 years but the trauma was still that brutally hard and impactful and to this day, I still struggle with the scars and the ghastly symptoms.

Though it is more complicated than that because my understanding of ED-like habits are similar to actual habits that can become obsessive. It is a battle of mostly of my mind and people tend to focus more on the physical side

(there is actually plenty of different eating disorder-like habits that one may not be aware of even if the person looks completely fine

This is also the case that I have lived with an abusive family for the majority of my life and their behaviours, while I understand that they mean good intentions, paradoxically reinforce my habits even more and they are not (or choose not to) to self-aware that their actions of control, abuse, and emotional manipulation and power struggles actually reinforce my habits even more because I learned that a major theme in EDs is the theme of control.

And unfortunately, my abusive family, mostly involving my emotional and psychological side of abuse, the theme of control and power struggle was always there and since I have my entire life of being belittled, beaten (sometimes literally), and bullied (literally as well, I was severely bullied when I was younger … which I think that it is one of the reasons why I ended up with an ED and the PTSD sometimes comes up), and any other manipulative method that was used that felt me feeling sub-human.

And on top of that, the mentality of the ED that I am most familiar with involves the re-occurring theme of helplessness, desperation and survival. So you do not feel strong or able to be on your own two feet, sometimes not even literally if the ED is that severe.

So, I have been secretly and silently battling against or trying to be aware or coming to terms with these habits for many, many, many years.

To actually admit that I still struggle with these habits is a big struggle in itself because it quite literally feels like I am coming out of the closet when I do.

This is especially the case because of how my family treated me like a criminal for having the ED – it is as though if I admit to them that I still struggle with it (and admiring and accepting the problem is the first step for actually solving it which is a huge and difficult step) feels really hard to do because it feels like I am admitting defeat or being an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy because of their labelling.

Again, I do know that they mean well but their methods are often very paradoxically unhealthy which continuously put me in a double-edged struggle between accepting the problem and facing it, or enduring it again and not admitting “defeat” and admitting that I have this “curse”

And I feel that this is problem of having or struggling with an ED is even more emphasised by two things –

\- my family continuously reinforce my habits and even though they mean to help me in the best way that they can, the way they do them is very unhealthy and almost abusive (gaslighting, emotional guilt-tripping, power struggles, criminalisation and stigmatization and so on);

\- and also, because I seriously think that society (in general) reinforce these unhealthy habits and provoke us into ending up in eating disorders, whether intentional or unintentional. (which is a topic that is rarely spoken publically in-depth about)

The society part is the thing that really grinds my gears.

First of all, whenever we hear about eating disorders, it is usually about the main ones like anorexia or bulimia but there are mentions of the other ones that we are not really aware of like orthorexia, body dysmorphia, pica (this is a weird one and we still do not know why it exists) and rumination disorder (which a new one too).

And for the most part, we often talk about the physical aspect or the physical signs.

For example, if you tell someone that you geniuenely think that you have an eating disorder, there is a chance that they will say “but you don’t look unhealthy” which is a projection and not empathetic to the mental struggles that are involved in this hugely complex battle.

Also, we tend to think that females only have this. At first, it makes sense because of the peer pressure of social gender roles and people are very aware of this because of how much this is emphasised and has always been emphasised throughout history for women (and we still encourage them still – look at whatever female health magazine that you can find or specific cultures that promotes or enforce certain female ideals)

But when it comes to men, these pressures are always encountered, not discouraged.

The whole idea of the ideal male, body-wise, health-wise, occupation-wise and so on, it is has rarely been questioned or debated or spoken about publically.

All these pressures of males looking in a certain way has mostly been disguised as hard work and this toxic masculinity makes it difficult for males, including me, to actually admit that we struggle with this and have to come to terms with it.

This is the case of the whole business model of fitness – there are plenty of shades of grey in this industry – good, bad and everything in between.

And there are even these types of diets that are really questionable – like fad diets or diets that are marketed as the new big thing but the science is still uncertain like the keto diet or the Atkins diet; or the worst part – crash diets which we often find among celebrities or athletes who needed to reach a certain physique or goal in a short period.

And despite the serious health repercussions (plus the possibility of doping which also a huge issue and not just in terms of legal issues, competitiveness and health), many market this to encourage guys to “train like \[insert celebrity here\]” or “eat like \[this awesome hot guy\]”.

There is a lot of bro-science (a sort of pseudo-science) involved and this type of “hard work” is often encouraged and it is rarely questioned or spoken about in public.

So, then what happens?

Guys continue to struggle with these issues in secret, afraid to admit them, afraid to face them, afraid to face that they are not as “manly” as society expects them to be, “work hard” even if your health and your money is involved …. Then die.

What a way to live!

&#x200B;

And this goes back to my abusive background - abuse is often regarded as a ""female"" issue which is indeed true quantitatively but rarely do we mention male victims because of how social gender roles define males as aggressive, violent, tough, emotionally mature and a whole list of ideals and stereotypes.

But realistically, how can every man really fit in all of these ideals into one?

&#x200B;

Bear in mind that these qualities of masculinity are things that actually helped me a lot as well - coincidentally enough, I like the feeling of being strong and tough and I coincidentally am a fan of martial arts and the military so I like the feel.

But the other side of the story is rarely critiqued because while I like to ""be a man"" and be strong, be hard-working and successful, acting or looking like a certain way, and being able to persist through any difficulty like all the ""great"" heroes of old, I am still a feeble human being and just because I have testicles, does not mean that I still cannot struggle or have bad days or even feel fear or sadness or regret.

But this is never discussed and it is actually more encouraged.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

**The struggles of coming to terms with ""being a man"" and with other issues like an eating disorder (sort of) are quadruple in the effort -**

**1. because I am a male so I should be ""like a man"",**

**2. because I was abused, manipulated and bullied because of it but I am encouraged to ""act tough"" and ""man up"",**

**3. things like EDs and other male issues are rarely spoken in public**

**4. such issues are encouraged and disguised as ""manly"" or often disguised as benefits or work hard EDs or unhealthy diets disguised as legitimate diets (sort of)**",1630576255.0

I happened upon two thin girls in a bathroom when I was 19, and they were holding babies. I don’t know what prompted me to ask, but I asked, “you are pretty. How do you stay so thin and have babies?” (I looked about 12. And never in my life would I ever again ask anyone that, it’s incredibly rude.) One of them said, “you’re a little young, but we eat, then throw up. You shouldn’t try it. It’s not good for you. Just watch your calories and take up running. “ (I was already doing that. Food tracking? I’m a pro). I sought out books in college libraries. Laxatives? What? Okay. I got tips from dancers: “Just chew and spit like everyone else. It’s better for your teeth.” I went to a Conservatory university, hoping to major in music therapy. I got to know every restaurant with private stalls. 

So things got worse, but I never got to 95 lbs. I continued until I got preg. at 28. While pregnant, I kept an eye on calories and did exactly what pregnant books said. A couple years before I got pregnant, I took ballet so I didn’t have to eat at night. 

I gained weight once I stopped counting cals. Every single diet: 5 bite diet, I was doing that a long time ago. Macros? Yep. I hadn’t had any weight loss, so I joined Orange Theory this year. I do a 5k almost every weekend. Orange Theory does enough, but I decided I needed to work on abs and legs. (I have 3 5ks in one weekend coming up). I joined Planet Fitness for non OT days. I then decided to try Macrosinc coaching for 3 months cause I didn’t like StrongerU. I’ve done that for a couple of weeks. The last 5k had donuts, “I don’t deserve a donut. Besides it’ll mess with my macros.” I need to lose 40-50 lbs so I don’t mind. It’s now a defense mechanism. I’m a nurse and do referrals for medications. So it went from dormant to defense mechanism. I did write a 400 page book about it. It’s not published. I’m not about to tell my macrosinc coach. All this tracking! They really make people track everything they eat? Yep. Well at this point, I don’t want to lose the thought process. It’ll help. That’s all.",1630513838.0

I am not diagnosed with an eating disorder ... not officially anyway.

I did however get diagnosed with an ED (anorexia nervosa) about 10 years ago and while I managed to get a hold of this puzzling battle, there are a few symptoms and temptations that still linger.

Though it is more complicated than that because my understanding of ED-like habits are similar to actual habits that can become obsessive. This is also the case that I have lived with an abusive family for the majority of my life and their behaviours, while I understand that they mean good intentions, paradoxically reinforce my habits even more and they are not (or choose not to) to self-aware that their actions of control, abuse, and emotional manipulation and power struggles actually reinforce my habits even more because I learned that a major theme in EDs is the theme of control.

So I have been secretly and silently battling against or trying to be aware or coming to terms with these habits for many, many, many years and to actually admit that I still struggle with these habits is a big struggle in itself because it quite literally feels like I am coming out of the closet when I do.

And I feel that this is even more emphasised by two things - my family continuously reinforce my habits and even though they mean to help me in the best way that they can, the way they do them is very unhealthy and almost abusive (gaslighting, emotional guilt-tripping, power struggles, criminalisation and stigmatization and so on); and also, because I seriously think that society (in general) reinforce these unhealthy habits and provoke us into ending up in eating disorders, whether intentional or unintentional.

And this is the part that I really want to focus on.

&#x200B;

**INTRO**

So I am having a bit of a dilemma here.

I have this argument that the whole concept of aesthetics and body fat which are really think that risks bridging or provoking people who develop unhealthy levels of self-esteem because of how these body images are marketed. I am not saying that this is done intentionally but a lot of marketing that I am familiar with promote these things in ways that consequently ""promote"" unhealthy disorders

I have this argument that these ambitions are mostly there for marketing purposes and do not have that much impact on sports performance even though aesthetics is the most attractive feature when people start to go to the gym and be more strict with their diet. I am saying this because I have in the fitness hobby for a long time now (good and bad ... it is a complicated story)

My argument is that these pressures on looking good when it comes to performing sports or fitness, in general, is just an unhealthy standard and the way we are pushed to achieve this is paradoxically unhealthy and not in line with our desires of performing well in our sport and living healthily. 

&#x200B;

So much so, that I think this promotes or provokes people to end up with unhealthy habits or eating disorders (whether done intentionally or not because I am aware that the fitness industry is a business with many shades of grey - though I have to highlight that there is a lot of shady practices that I do not think that many people are aware of or speak openly about)

That being said, I must admit that even I have this pressure to look the part when I do a certain exercise or sport because whenever I see an athlete (Crossfit is the type of sport that I am currently doing), they tend to be a balanced mix between being chiselled and lean but also strong and athletic. And yes, there is a chance that they do this through a lot of strict dieting or perhaps with the use of PEDs.

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

I also take a large portion of my time to focus on my diet - macros ratio, looking into scientific research to tackle my satiation, my recovery, my hunger and appetite, stress level and sleep quality, level of focus or even satisfaction and so on.

(and yes, I am very attentive on this part because the science is broad and I do not wish to fall for pseudo-science or what we often call ""bro-science"". Not only that, but my experience told me that if we are not self-aware, we might do whatever method that fits our desperation and not realise that we end up taking things too far, let alone that there are the risks that these diets or recommendations may not be supported by valid nutrition and sport science)

Still, it is an attractive feature to look the part and I work really hard on my performance and to follow the diet that I use (and I am experimenting because I know that this whole subject of dieting is huge and bizarre)

(aside from the other themes that are related to the theme of ""control"" in EDs because it is a misconception that people think that it is only because people want to look good or achieve certain goals related to health or fitness)

&#x200B;

 I have been into the fitness hobby (sometimes it is a hobby, sometimes it is routine) for years now and while I am not an expert by any means, I developed a lot of interest in the fitness and nutrition subject, particularly in the niche aspects regarding health.

And something that I really learned is that the whole thing of ""health"" is really broad and while there are standards that have been shown to promote good health and well-being (such as fighting against obesity and other health problems in relation of certain diets, fitness or lifestyles, or certain diets promoting or reinforcing physical or mental health), I learned that the subject is complicated and really controversial too.

And from my understanding, this is also why we have a whole plethora of different diets and philosophies where the science is murky and we end up trying or falling for all kinds of programs and other things.

&#x200B;

**THE MAIN RANT - BUSINESS AND SOCIETY**

 This is where I am a bit confused and sometimes angry too.

I do understand that fitness has a business behind it - good, bad and everything in between and do not wish to say that all business that is related to this subject is all bad.

Though at the same time, I am getting the impression that the lack of concreteness in this field is so prominent that I am not sure what is a good way of dieting or programming your diet and fitness schedule to fit your goals, or whether these are things that are being marketed in clever ways that trick into something.

And I am getting the impression that it is affecting your expectations of us or our understanding of what we think of what our ideal selves should be or what is the ideal health.

For example, I am aware that fitness is ""promoted"" a lot in Hollywood and the standards (which are mostly aesthetic) are often very apparent in Hollywood and have a huge effect of what people look for when they want to look or live in a certain way. This is also the case that America also has a large obesity issue where most of its food portions are large and unhealthily processed, and some of the insight that I found was that the way that some actors and models achieved these physiques in such short periods also raises a lot of flags.

But nonetheless, because of our desperation, we end up falling for our own hedonic desires and at the same time, I am getting the impression that these standards are either way too high, can only be achieved for a short-term and can be very unhealthy, and/or at the same time, our demands and needs to reach certain standards are distracted by so many temptations and another plethora of messages that give us so many confusing emotions about many things.

Like wanting to lose weight but the availability of so many products, good, bad, sugary or not, are easy and either affordable or are not. Or at times, we are also marketed to eat healthily all the time where I think that we are encouraged to follow these ""health diets"" to the letter and avoid the ""tempting"" bad side at all costs.

And in conclusion to all of this, all of these confusing puzzles and messages and double standards in fitness, diet or even standards in society, I am getting the impression that we are ending up falling victim to a lot of unhealthy habits and possibly even eating disorders like anorexia or orthorexia or even depression or OCD.

&#x200B;

 I can only say this based on personal perception and personal experience because I fell these temptations many times and I even fell victim to an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) almost 10 years ago and I still feel its effects and my judgement tells me that a part of it because of these such high standards that we have to live up to and if we do not manage, or because of the plethora of other messages and contradictions that we get, we end up falling to extremes or deep depressions that it is as though it is the end of the world when in reality, this is based on the expectations of certain ideals like bodily self-esteem or aesthetic which changes from time to time or from culture to culture. 

&#x200B;

**THE MAIN RANT - PERSONAL AMBITIONS**

Now I have been working on losing a tiny bit of my body fat for the sake of aesthetic purposes.

(I will not delve into this because I do not want to trigger anyone. It is only a tiny bit of body fat and nothing more) and I understand that losing body fat is pretty hard when you have been working out for so long, especially if the amount of body fat that you have left is not much.

Now I looked into all the factors that I can gather - diet, sleep schedule, stress levels, my daily activity, my lifestyle, my occupation and so on.

&#x200B;

I know that I am not perfect and this is going to take a long time.

But I slowly realised that I was starting to feel frustrated, possibly even going insane or desperate when I started to feel that I cannot achieve what I am aiming for.

It started to make me feel hopeless but at the same time, it is opening my eyes because I am reflecting on this and figuring out why this is important, at least to me.

&#x200B;

Because I am also battling with my own ideas of living a healthy life and not just sticking to my diet and program to the letter because I do not want to risk delving into an eating disorder of some kind (I already had one 10 years ago and the effects still linger, especially because the theme of discipline and consistency constantly mix and can easily confuse with obsession and rigidness) like orthorexia (which I think that many athletes struggle with this or that the fitness industry promotes the need to eat healthily so much that we end up developing these ""healthy"" obsessions) or some other unhealthy mental habit (as I also struggle with those as well).

&#x200B;

I know that life is much more than fitness, diet and anything related to this lifestyle even though they form a huge part of my life (and many people promote this for the sake of health .... mostly) and at the same time, I am reflecting on this because I remember that a major reason as to why I wanted to or even continue to exercise is because of this ambition to achieve a certain physique.

I know that my gut tells me that aesthetics are subjective and the concept of the ideal body image changes from time to time or from culture to culture, let alone that the concept of health is also ambiguous too.

But at the same time, possibly because of peer pressure or because of the power of marketing, I also want to achieve this ""ideal"" look, even though my gut tells me that this is only a dream, something that I can hope to achieve but cannot really achieve at its 100% or can only be done by very strict dieting and consistency for months or even years.

&#x200B;

 There is a chance that this is also because when I have been working hard for a long time and when you have some fat left (I am not that low, almost 12% to 13% body fat), it gets harder to remove that unneeded fat. But in the end, that struggle gives me a sense of failure and even desperation and I have been reflecting on this and trying to understand why the hell am I pressuring myself so much about this just because I get to see a tiny bit of muscle when I do not know if I am going to be able to keep it like that all year around or whether it will affect my performance or my happiness.

&#x200B;

**DOES IT REALLY MATTER?**

The last part is what I want to highlight - why do I want my happiness to be so dependent based on a tiny need/want on how I want to look like?

And I am asking, does this really matter in the end?

Is this ambition to look the part actually affect one's happiness in the long run? Does the advertisement of the before and after photos where you find this average person becoming more muscular or aesthetically pleasing and beautiful actually have a better quality of life or more recognition and respect and so on? Or is it all just a myth? 

&#x200B;

 **TLDR - I am getting the impression that the health industry is paradoxically promoting a lot of unhealthy standards that are (directly or indirectly) promoting unhealthy behaviours or disorders.** 

**Do the overall body fat and body image in fitness have an effect on not just one's performance but also self-esteem, satisfaction and happiness?** 

**Does the archetypical advert of the average person being changed into a more aesthetically pleasing thing actually have a better quality of life or is it a myth?**",1630397581.0
Telling my doctor?,8,pf2qij,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pf2qij/telling_my_doctor/,3,"Hey everyone,

I'm having an appointment at my doctor (would be general physician, I guess) on Thursday.

I'm very exhausted lately. I'm dealing with a lot of stress (full time job, baby 9 month, general election campaigning + we moved to a new apartment recently) and I often find myself falling asleep when I don't want to...

As it did with my last relapse (early 2018),this amount of stress triggered me back into ED and I lost quite some weight in February till April, started binging then and now I'm around the edge to being underweight but I'm trying to lose weight again. All in all this has been going on for 8 month now and I've never had it for this long...

I'm still hoping that my stress level drops after the election (end of September) and I could go back to normal then but there's no guarantee, I guess.

Overall I'm in miserable condition and I'm thinking about losing weight basically all day long... And at night I usually eat a volume of safe foods to fill my stomach but in a lot of cases I can't control it at some point and start binging on cookies or similar. It makes me feel like a fake...

I'm not restricting a ton as I'm married, so I eat 3 times a day + at night as mentioned above. But I've managed to cut portion size and change our meal plan to salads and soups for about half of the time. I would call it 'high restriction'.
If also noticed quite some hair loss but I'm actually not eating that low amount of calories, I guess?

Back to the start: I'm seeing my doctor on Thursday and I'm not 100% sure if I should tell him about my ED. It was never diagnosed but I'm pretty sure I have it. The question is if I would want to face the consequences and recover and have it in my medical records (important for getting insurance here) or if I'm happy if he checks my blood and my overall condition without the bonus information of having an ED. Question is if he can figure it out himself. As I said I'm thin but not disturbingly.

Sorry for the long and chaotic text and if someone has some ideas about the situation, please let me know",1630403927.0

When is it bad?,33,pcttt1,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/pcttt1/when_is_it_bad/,25,"I basically just want to know if it’s possible to have an ED without doing physical harm. Where is the threshold when it becomes “bad”?

My ED behaviours are admittedly pretty mild. I high restrict and exercise 2-3 hours a day, so I’m achieving a solid caloric deficit, but I don’t b/p, or take lax etc.

My psychologist is concerned from a mental health POV because of how much of my headspace it is taking up, and how much it impacts my sense of self worth and anxiety etc.

My doctor, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to think there’s any problem. I’ve gone from mid-range overweight to low range normal BMI over about 8 months, but he just gives me this look that says “but, you were fat and now you’re skinny… that’s a good thing”. Apparently I’m not losing fast enough for it to be a worry. I have mild bradycardia, but he says that’s just athletic conditioning from regular exercising. He won’t refer me for extra psych sessions (I am currently paying full fees out of pocket - ouch) because I am still a healthy weight. 

Is he right? Is there no harm to what I’m doing until I’m actually underweight? 

The whole situation is basically just fuelling my drive to lose weight faster because there’s a massive financial incentive. Also I feel like I’m “not doing it right” because I’m not of concern. UGH. 

Any insights/experiences would be appreciated, thanks!",1630091173.0

The first time I was hospitalized was almost 10 years ago. I was 14 and just barely underweight and my restricting and purging had caused something funky with my heart (forget what it was but they did an EKG then made me go inpatient the next day). My hair was brittle and I’d get dizzy but otherwise I felt healthy. After a few short relapses over the next year or two I was mostly recovered until this winter, and have been relapsing hard since. My BMI is still (just barely) overweight but I’ve lost over 75 pounds in the last year. My hair is falling out in handfuls to the point you can literally see a bald spot at the front of my scalp and my eyebrows are so patchy that I have to fill them in with a pencil. I get heart palpitations and dizzy so easily. My body almost constantly hurts. Even though I’m at much higher weight the ED is hitting me so much harder now that I’m older and it’s bullshit. 

When I was a teen with an ED I barely had to exercise but if I did then I’d have hours to do it before anyone got home and before dinner. Now I get home from work and exercise for an hour + then cook dinner because I can’t trust my fiancé to cook and then it’s practically time for bed, I’m too exhausted to try to stay up late to get shit done. My mom was a nightmare growing up but she paid for treatment and held me accountable. Now I have no one to hold me accountable and if I wanted to get more treatment than seeing my therapist 1x a week then I wouldn’t be able to because I’d be the one paying for it and I have no money for it. I hate my teenaged self I had no clue how good I had it, I’d give anything to be able to get away with behaviors without all this physical side effect shit.

I’m currently reasonably skinny, so that’s great, but I’ve been getting so constipated. The kicker is that I eat enough to maintain my weight. I eat healthy and try to choose foods that have fiber.

Despite my efforts, I’m still constipated. It becomes a problem about once a week, and I’m pretty sure it’s what triggers binges for me. If I binge (usually between double or triple the normal amount of calories for me), I poop the next day. YAY! But then I continue my normal life and it happens again in about a week. I don’t feel deprived of food, I’m not underweight, I don’t feel any of the more emotional binge urge feelings that I used to feel.

My BMI is 20.x (it varies between .1 and .8 depending on…. Various disorderly behaviours). 

At the same time I have real trouble getting enough energy to do….. almost anything. Ppl tell me I’m horribly thin. Ofc I argue back that my bmi is completely ok. I restrict like crazy but getting a further weight reduction requires fasting and if I do eat then I end up doing lax. Which ain’t good. I’ve tried high restricting. That just results in weight gain. I’ve tried low restricting. Weight doesn’t go down. Medium restricting often results in a binge followed by lax. 

I believe I have *permission* to get my bmi down to 18.5 bc that’s still considered ok. Just. I feel horribly fat at 20.2. 

I’m 180cm/5’11” and male.

I’ve had severe anorexia in the past and been told I’m treatment resistant and therefore there’s nothing that can be done for me and I just have to manage on my own. So, I’m disinclined to go to my dr as they’d probably tell me to go away. 

I’ve googgled to death ‘bmi’ and all it repeatedly tells me is that 18.5 is my gw 🤷‍♂️ 

I’ve read that bmi is not the whole story but I can’t find any other measure that tells me….. you have a problem. Ergo. I don’t have a problem…..

I have since moved out and in with a new roommate. I noticed my eating habits got weirder. I started hiding the amount of food I would eat.

Anyway. I’ve started toying around with the idea of intermittent fasting or keto. Started abusing adderall again. And, as of tonight, am now purging after eating.  I was never really a bulimic. Because I was never really a binger.

I also have always told myself that if I let myself be +2 pounds, I have no wiggle room, one meal could push my weight over the edge. 2 pounds becomes 5 becomes 10 and before you know it I have ruined everything.

But what if I could trade control over 2 pounds for an increased sense of calm? I think I’d be ok, actually. No one can tell when you gain or lose two pounds. It just fuels my ED.

I have a millions other ED thoughts that come into play here, but I’ll spare you.

tl;dr - there is so much mental relief that comes from letting the numbers have less power.",1628541514.0

seeking relationship advice,23,p0h7fr,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/p0h7fr/seeking_relationship_advice/,10,"posting this here probably isn’t the “right” place, but i feel like a lot of you here are on similar wavelengths and have your head screwed on right (well, at least when it’s not about your own self lol). 

let me dive right in. 

my partner and i have been together for approximately 3 years. i’ve had a couple of long term relationships before him, and i thought he was such a vast improvement from my exes. he’s caring, thoughtful, supportive, etc. we basically had barely any problems through our relationship. if we did, it was usually a small argument (never shouting or insulting each other - you could probably just feel the tension more than anything, and then we would just talk it out, and a lot of the times, it was just misunderstandings. we’ve both done our fair share of apologising). 

but recently the number of these have increased. a lot of the times they’re just minor things, but it feels like we are just getting on each other’s nerves more than usual. we’re both under a lot of stress and i think it’s fair to say that we’ve both been feeling pretty depressed because of covid (lockdowns, not being able to travel etc), and work/life stress situations we’ve been in recently. i’d like to think we’re not letting our stress affect the relationship, but tbh, i think it is. (edit: just thought it was important to add, but we’ve spent the same amount of time together ie 1-2 days a week throughout the entirety of our relationship, so it’s not like we don’t give each other any space)

i don’t know what to do. my instinct is to back away and shut him out because i have this fear that he’ll leave me (and as fucked up as it is, i don’t want to be the one that is broken up with because it makes me feel like i completely lack control - and i’m sure some of you know how much that ties in with our ED behaviours). im insanely worried that this fear is driving some of my behaviour and negatively impacting our relationship. i’m scared that he’ll stop liking me. 

it feels like our relationship has been slowly breaking down despite how hard we’re trying to show each other love and work through this. is there a fundamental difference in personality that we can’t overcome?

i honestly can’t figure out if it’s me, him, us, or even external factors that’s dampening our relationship. i absolutely want things to improve but i just feel kinda at a loss. has anyone been in a similar situation and how did it turn out? what is something we can do that may help?",1628438217.0

Visible mental illness,17,ozin2q,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/ozin2q/visible_mental_illness/,0,"(*TW - self harm, trichotillomania*)

I was reflecting in therapy on some experiences from when I was younger, and how it felt to be visibly mentally ill.

My body never appeared ill to most people. But I was still visibly and publicly mentally ill in a lot of ways...not cute ways. Crying, screaming, constant breakdowns, over things that were objectively not a problem. I got in fights. I was missing my eyelashes, eyebrows, and most of my hairline. At times I had self-harm scars.

Everyone knew there was something wrong with me. And, in general, people aren't that kind to those with mental illness.

My family blamed me for making problems. Other adults wrote me off as seeking attention and being spoiled. My peers ignored me, or talked shit behind my back. The school admin people suspended me and semi-forced me to take medication to come back. The only people that still liked me were my teachers, because I was good in class, and a couple of friends who were going through similar ordeals (although I didn't know it at the time).

I was fucking ashamed and embarrassed 100% of the time. I tried to hide my behaviors as best I could, but it still crept out, or certain situations would push me to the edge. I was told I was being a bad role model for some younger kids, and that hurt so badly...I loved them fiercely and wanted to be supportive and positive for them.

I felt less than a person. I carpooled with these 2-3 other girls. When we walked to the car, I walked behind them. I sat in the back. They didn't look at me or speak to me the entire time. We drove together every day for 2 years, just like that. Sometimes, they ""forgot"" me and I waited for an hour in the snow.

The times when someone *was* actually kind to me were so powerful and painful. I will remember those moments forever. Then, I actually started to heal after a friend told me he was going through similar things with an ED, and I finally had someone in my life who understood and didn't judge me. I had other friends open up about self harm and problems with mental health and suddenly I felt like a person.

Whenever I see someone who's clearly going through it, like a stranger who's screaming out loud on the street, I feel for them. Because I've been there. I don't know why they're feeling that way and maybe they don't, either. But I understand that there's a lot more to them, than just their worst moments.",1628294372.0

I need some advice,11,ozbb8x,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/ozbb8x/i_need_some_advice/,6,"I just posted this in the EdAnonymous, someone suggested I should try here as well. 

First some background information:

\- My ED was pretty serious, and sort of peaked during 2020. It gradually got better from January 2021, but I never fully recovered.- It is important to me to do well academically, and it is important to me that everyone around me knows this. It's annoyingly a part of my identity, and I have always done really well in this part of my life.

So... I handed in my master's thesis in May, but I got some formalities wrong, so the exam board failed me. Obviously this sent me to really dark and panicky place, and I cried a lot during June and July. There's a lot of self-loathing, extreme guilt, and (you guessed it) my ED came sneaking back.

They offered me another chance (phew) to submit an edited version at the end of this month. However, the exam board also pointed out weaknesses in my thesis. My supervisor wants me to fix the weaknesses, and I have worked on this since June. I honestly haven't gotten much done, and there is a lot of work left. I am exhausted, and not doing well mentally. I start my first full-time job at the end of August, and I've had no time off this summer. I have fixed the formalities, and some of the weaknesses, but my supervisor says it needs a lot more work. Parallel with this, I'm catching myself doing more and more ED behaviours.

My questions for you are:

1. Should I tell my supervisor about my ED? If so, what good would come out of it?
2. Should I soldier through and do the work that I have been told to do?
3. Or should I just throw in the towel now and say ""I'm done"". It is what it is, give me a grade and get it over with.

My problems are:

1. I catch myself being somewhat grateful for my ED slowly returning. I know how terrible and dumb this is, and I can see the irrationality from the outside, but I can't help but being happy that I'm losing weight again. I am also aware that this is normal. But if I tell my supervisor that I am worried about my ED; I'm actually lying. I am not worried about my ED, I'm at the stage where I'm somewhat welcoming it.
2. I worry that I am using my ED as an excuse. That I'm just tired of this thesis and just looking for excuses not to do the work. I've worked on it for over a year, and I'm honestly so sick of it.
3. I actually don't know if this even triggered my ED. It might just be a coincidence.

What would you do in my situation? Any advice? Any thoughts?",1628270817.0

Warning about an indie horror film director who ~allegedly~ preys on young women in the ana community. (TW!!),103,oy6ao1,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/oy6ao1/warning_about_an_indie_horror_film_director_who/,9,"Everything in this thread is ALLEGED. :) 

Hello. I’m well aware that this is not the type of post that normally fits this subreddit, but I felt a moral obligation to warn everyone here about an indie horror film director who allegedly preys upon young women online who have eating disorders. He goes by the alias Lucifer Valentine and is known for his directorial debut [Slaughtered Vomit Dolls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughtered_Vomit_Dolls) - a very extreme and brutal microbudget art house horror film about a young woman with bulimia. It has newfound noterity due to it being put at the bottom of the [Disturbing Movies Iceberg](https://twitter.com/apoca1ypse_n0w/status/1365468884917190656) list which blew up on TikTok and Reddit earlier this year. 

There are serious allegations against this man that range from alleged online grooming of minors, alleged sexual misconduct, and alleged incest, but the reason why I am posting this here is because he allegedly preys on young vulnerable women with EDs and/or are pro-ana on the internet (I’m talking minors - according to the allegations). Given that a lot of people on this subreddit either have an ED or have struggled with one, we need to draw attention to things like this. 

This [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/mondovideos/status/1421863775536394246?s=21) goes into specific detail showcasing various allegations from minors that he allegedly seeks out young women online who are clearly damaged from anorexia to star in his movies, and then allegedly exploits their EDs on film by making them vomit. One of the first tweets in this thread goes into specific detail about the director allegedly giving shelter to the lead actress of his films (who was 18 at the time and struggling with both severe anorexia and debilitating mental illness and substance abuse) and then allegedly taking advantage of her in a vulnerable state. 

I wanted to post this to warn every person on this subreddit who is into horror films to stay far away from this man and his “films”. I have heard testimonies from various women online that talk about how he allegedly fetishized their eating disorder and allegedly acted predatory towards them. 

I will also be linking a TikTok detailing these allegations below. If you have Twitter, please PLEASE retweet the thread in order to draw attention to it. No woman should be taken advantage of like this. Thank you.

It’s a never ending battle,15,oycsh7,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/oycsh7/its_a_never_ending_battle/,5,"I despair. I’ve been battling with AN since childhood, too one degree or another, ranging from anxiety surrounding food/eating to disordered eating to severe AN. 

I’ve had ‘treatment’ which ofc didn’t work. I’ve tried everything and now find myself back at a low BMI and really struggling to get lower where I’d be…. Less unhappy.

One thing which treatment did is give me an encyclopaedic knowledge of everything related to nutrition etc. This has empowered me to ‘experiment’ with all possibilities and at the same time made the whole thing an exercise in messing around with my body and mind. 

I’ve been told by friends/family to go to my gp. Why should I? I’ve been told tht I’m treatment resistant and to just… manage as best I can. Furthermore, bc my BMI isn’t dangerously low, they’d not be interested. To prove this, I emailed my gp with weight, height,BMI, amongst other things. Result: no response. Which proves my point. 

I’ve tried eating my way out of it. All tht happens is I get massively depressed as I see the figures go up. That then leads to sh and panic fasting, combined with dark thoughts abt how it wld just be so much easier if I didn’t exist. 

My ed voice is on my case every waking hour threatening me with dire consequences should I think it a ‘good idea’ to eat something. And there’s no so such thing as eating ‘a little bit’. If I awaken my appetite I become ravenous and eat what I call a binge but tbh is actually a normal amount. The resultant weight gain and guilt merely feeds the ed voice which then says ‘your fault, idiot, for starting to eat. Best not eat one single thing. And to repair the damage you’ve just done, that means a 48 hour fast’. 

This leads to yo-yo weight fluctuations and related confusion. 

What next? I feel tht the only way to be even remotely content is to hammer the BMI down to underweight and then at least the ed voice will be quiet…. For a bit….. until I get there…. And then? Lower still, it’ll demand, judging by the past.

Would my loved ones be sad yes but in the scheme of things and how small we are REALLY in this world does that really REALLY matter? I wake up everyday going through the motions like a broken record.

Major TW for numbers, but they will be spoiler'd (you've been warned).

So things have been shitty since last September. I've kind of been losing weight on and off by restricting punctuated by random weeks/months of normal(ish) eating.

I hit my lowest weight this Spring...BMI dropped to the >!13s!<. I genuinely thought I looked shitty and was embarrassed by how grotesquely thin I looked. Wore baggy clothes and long sleeves all the time because I didn't want people at work to see how bony I was. I *wanted* to gain weight, but I couldn't convince myself to eat.

Then I ended up in a string of social food situations, and I ended up eating more. And then bingeing and purging a few times. And then back to eating normal(ish) for a while, which because I'm underweight and my metabolism is really, really trashed, made me gain weight. Not a ton. Like >!5-10!< lbs over the span of several months. Which is what I *wanted*. But now that I'm here, I feel grotesque in the other direction. Like I can see all the fat hanging off my body and I'm fucking mortified. I know logically I can't be fat, because my BMI is in the >!15s!< but it FEELS SO REAL. Everything is squishy and I cannot tolerate it...it feels like I'm going to lose my mind any second, and I'm no longer numbed out, so my emotions are raw and off the wall too.

Is this how it's gonna be now? Like, if I'm not ~extremely~ anorexic I'm gonna feel fat? That's my fucking baseline?

To make matters worse, I used to think that if I hit the >!13s!< I'd feel like a ""real anorexic,"" but that didn't fucking happen, and now I just want to see the >!12s!<. 

I hate this. Hate this body, hate food, hate that I feel that overwhelming urge to restrict again and I probably will because that's how it goes, right?",1627873626.0

Looking at me they said ""you know the good thing about weight loss is that you look like you will when you have had top surgery especially with baggy clothes"".
I know they probably meant it in a more positives than I have taken it, and probably didn't want me to use it as an excuse to restrict and maybe they think I'm doing better (but still know I'm restricting) because I spoke about eating.every day and.they're not very observant so don't know how bad things are.
But it's really Fucking me up. Partly because they're kinda right, partly because it is one of the reasons I developed a restrictive ED, and partly because I'm so hurt by their comment and need to talk to them about  it but I don't want to because I'm.so full of emotion about it, and have been using it as fuel for my x days fast which I have been increasing. 
Idk what to do.

Like I am still having to measure my food and weigh my proteins, I have to essentially count macros to meet my exchange goals for every meal, I have to plan out everything in advance instead of just eating what feels/sounds good. 

I was trying to plan a dinner to make for tonight and looking through recipes, and my meal plan calls for one fat exchange but nearly every recipe would require me to use probably more than a single tablespoon of oil, and I also wanted to make a sauce but that would also require more than one fat exchange. So I am having to choose between roasting my veggies with oil, being able to bake my tofu, or making a sauce for the dish. I could make a sauce and eat raw/steamed veggies and tofu, or cook the tofu and veggies but omit sauce and it would be dry and bland. I feel almost more limited and restricted than when I’m not following a meal plan, because at least I can eat what sounds good to me (but in smaller, controlled portions). Now I have to eat a large volume of bland food and nothing about my relationship to food changes other than the caloric intake. I am still having to view food in numerical terms, and instead of getting to enjoy my food I have to eat meals that are incoherent and still don’t feel like they resemble how normal people eat. 

One of the most exciting and motivating prospects of recovery for me was being able to have the freedom to cook without having to calculate every aspect of the meal and just making what sounds good, and this is not allowing me to do that. I get that there needs to be a system in place to ensure that I’m eating substantial enough portions and a balanced diet with a variety of foods but this just doesn’t feel helpful at all and I am still having to spend way too much mental energy thinking about food and feeling guilty that the things I want to eat don’t necessarily match the meal plan all the time. I feel like I’ll just end up eating the same meals every single day to avoid having to think so much about how to come up with different ways each day to fit all my exchanges at the times they’re supposed to be eaten. Has anyone had success with a different model of meal planning with their dietician?

# TW: anorexia, ednos, body dysmorphia, weight, long term side effects.

&#x200B;

I will be 30 years old this september. I've had an eating disorder since longer than I can remember. But I do remember the trigger, I was 13. Just knowing that I've had to consciously cohabit with this absolute monster for 17 years makes me *exhausted.*

(**Background:** My parents have always been on a diet and exercising. So as far as I can remember, I was told that being tall and thin equals beautiful and happy.  I was told ""you know where this ends"" every single time I had sweets. I was told that I've put on weight with every single pound I put on. And that's *before* the trigger. This guy who, at 16, didn't want to date a 13yo. My dumb brain didn't understand the age difference, and there was the monster, all ready to take charge and convince me that it was because I was too >!fat!<. And there I was, having a full blown ED and trying to survive puberty). 

The next years were punctuated by relationships, as toxic as great, each one teaching me things about myself. The most toxic one I almost didn't survive. I was on and off >!restricting!<, depending on the relationship. And then I met my now ex boyfriend, still best friend. He was perfect, loved every part of me, even tamed the monster. I was so happy. I was about 22yo at the time, and was finally eating. Then, almost 4 years later, we realized we were much happier being best friends, and I realized I was now near >!200lbs!< (I'm 5'7"" and was always near >!125-130lbs!< when I was eating the most normally I knew how). That broke me, as I felt this warm embrace and inhaled that disgusting, toxic, familiar air, filling every single cell in my lungs. She was here.

I was 26 and the monster was back. I heard about this thing called Intermittent Fasting, and the monster and I were *so happy.* We've had finally found a way for both of us to stay in this toxic and parasitic relationship where we were both happy. Fast forward 2 years, dropped about >!70lbs!< and was ecstatic. I was finally beautiful and happy. I was posting mild NSFW stuff on my first reddit account. I savored every single comments and messages about how thin, sexy, quirky and beautiful I was. Being single and living alone during quarantine was hard, but I was finally getting the kind of attention I craved. Receiving relentless messages from regular followers, all enthralled and in awe of my perfect body, how they wanted to be with me, smoke weed and do dirty things. No need to say, in my head, desire towards my body was synonym of love. And I never really knew or experienced that love language. I posted every single day for about 8 months. I was hooked on it.

Now, fast forward to october 2020, when I started dating my now boyfriend. We've been friends for almost 10 years, even were roommates for a year at one point. I was open about everything: my past, my ED, posting mild NSFW stuff, how it helped my confidence, etc. He was understanding of everything and only asked me to stay open about how I was feeling and what I was doing. I was the one who decided to stop posting. I was in a healthy relationship and didn't need thousands of strangers in awe of me anymore. I then noticed I didn't hear or felt the monster anymore, was eating the most normally I knew how and reminding open about my ED with my boyfriend. He helps as much as he can, and I love him so much for it.

The thing is, I've put on about >!10-15lbs!< since I started dating him and I talked to him about it a couple months ago. He told me he really did not see where the weight went, that he thinks I'm beautiful and how he always wants me, as he knew that's what I wanted to hear. And the thing is, I really wanted to believe him. I thought maybe it was just my body dysmorphia that caused seeing myself so much more >!fat!< than I really was. So, I deleted almost the entirety of my NSFW content, as I was constantly comparing myself and didn't feel good about it. Then, I started *really* working on my ED, working towards being better, being healthy of body, but mostly mind. Looking for help when I needed it. Listening to my body and my needs, trying to understand. Digging inwards, as one could say.

That's when I found her cave. Her perfectly finished and furnished, even remodeled cave. She never left, *not even once*. She was just retreating to her >!fucking!< monstrous hole, deep in between my heart and brain, deep within my every day thoughts and actions and reflexes and dreams and daydreams patiently waiting for me to be alone in the cold in the dark and she was just... **there, always**.

What scares me is, she doesn't look like she's leaving anytime soon, or even thinking about leaving for that matter. I have been living with a monster for almost 20 years, and it did its thing. I've had low blood sugar for 10 years now. I also have low blood pressure, I regularly faint when I get up too fast or when I lean for more than 5 seconds. I loose my hair so much, my menstruations are far from regular and I'm *always* cold. And that's just the top of the iceberg, to be honest.

What scares me the most is, I kind of want her to get out of her cave and hang out with me again. Because in my **very, very sick brain**, I was happier when she was hanging out with me. When she was always whispering in my ear, controlling me, making sure that *I* got what *she* needed the most...

So, here we still are, 17 conscious, exhausting years later, still living every single day with that monster inside of me. The one who is ruining my life, who is responsible for so much pain and sadness and >!blood!< and tears. The one who makes me believe everyone around me is lying to me about my body, even the love of my life. 

&#x200B;

Despite this, I want her back... and that just... *breaks me.*",1627353114.0

So, long story short I went from an obese BMI to a near UW BMI 5 years ago. I dropped all that weight, I weigh less than half of what I used to , in like a single year""s worth of time. Needless to say that was my first restriction cycle and really fucking dangerous.

I've since gained a bit to a healthy weight for me and managed to maintain that weight without too much trouble from my ED until 4-ish months ago? At which point my life felt out of control and I experienced a relapse in restricting behaviors. I eventually had it mostly under control and my head was in a good place but also i realized that my loose skin was allowing me to lie to myself about how much it was healthy for me to ultimately weigh.

So here I am after a lower body lift and breast lift with implants and... I'm not feeling anxious about my physical appearance or weight at all. 

Let me contextualize that. I'm swollen with over 10 pounds of fluid, scarred and generally looking as well as my body feels (total shit)  and I have no desire to restrict for any reason. I'm excited to be done with the skin at last. I think I'd be okay gaining this amount of weight for real as long as I felt good.

Hi there. I never thought I'd be posting about this on reddit but here we are. I don't have an eating disorder but I know that I definitely am ""weird with food"". My family and I are going on a Disney trip this summer which would usually be a happy thought, right? Something I should be extremely grateful for? But instead of being appreciative that I'm able to go on this trip all I can think about is ways to get out of it because I'm terrified of eating the food. I have loved Disney all of my life and I've been thinking of ways to get out of going just because of how scared I am of the food there. I also feel extremely ungrateful and selfish to even be thinking like this because it's honestly such a first world problem -- but here I am posting about it on Reddit anyways. Has anyone ever felt like this before going on a trip? I can't even be happy when my family brings the trip up because of how much anxiety it's causing me.

Bullet point backstory for context:
- Diagnosed with AN-Restrictive subtype in high school 2003; quickly moved to AN-Purging subtype until 2016ish. (A few treatment centers and lots of OP therapy and stuff in there)
- Been married for quite a while now (double digit years) and now have a lot of chronic physical illnesses that came to a head a handful of years ago, leaving me suddenly disabled and unable to do  anything but address the physical crises (not ED-related).
- During that time, my AN quieted down somewhat, at least as far as behaviors go, even though I had to start following a pretty restrictive medical diet for my conditions (also not ED related, 100% medical), but the mental battle was still there, big time.
- I’ve had a few feeding tubes placed in recent years for non-ED chronic illness GI issues, and during that time, I think I convinced myself I was mentally much better off than I actually am.

So, to present day:
Who’s the clown who thought she’d purposely go on ED tiktok and EDC and WIEIAD vlogs and my other go-to triggers (using MFP and fasting apps, those same subreddits, etc) to prove that she couldn’t dare fall into the trap again? Yeah, that clown is me.

Imagine my surprise when I somehow thought the concept of “fear foods” wasn’t something I dealt with anymore…yet when I went to try to eat [formerly safe/non-threatening/nutritious food] yesterday, an all-too-familiar panic gripped my heart, I froze, and I put it back because I just got too freaked out. I felt like I was a teen again. It was not cool. It was not expected. And it’s no one’s fault but my own.

What else did I expect from purposely seeking out triggers? I know that’s a rhetorical question because while we all logically KNOW it’s harmful, or could be, at least, logic doesn’t matter one iota when the ED is apparently more present than you thought it’s been for years.

Moral of the story: if you have to go on a medically restricted diet, tube feeds, or TPN for a non-ED reason, and you get used to receiving all nutrition via formula or the small selection of foods your doctor says you can eat, even so much as not overtly fearing the formula or the doctor-sanctioned foods, don’t let your guard down by assuming it means you’re fear food free. 

Could it happen? Yeah, anything’s possible. Is it likely to happen? IME, I have to say no, because when I was face to face with a food I’d not been able to try for years, and even though it’s a food society deems heathy and is actually a nutrient-dense whole food that used to be “safe” even as far as my ED goes (it legit has never before been a fear food for me), the fear hit hard and fast, with no warning, and my physical fight or flight response had me running out of the kitchen and shutting myself in the bedroom.

At which point I further panicked realizing I essentially triggered a relapse without realizing it. To clarify, I know that what I was doing was looking stuff up with stupid, and I know my ED was convincing me I’d be safe (ofc there was a subconscious level on which my ED brain hoped it would happen, but no, not *really*, because I know there’s nothing but hell down this road), only to yank the carpet out from under me, leaving me falling smack down on my face onto the  pavement that is relapse.

You can never be too careful in avoiding triggers, whether current triggers or any you’ve had in the past, because ED is insidious and will slip in any chance it’s given. And it’s really good at convincing us it needs more chances. (It doesn’t)

Don’t be a 🤡 like I was if you can avoid it. Nearly 20 years into this crap and it’s exhausting.

Sending love, empathy, and virtual hugs to anyone who needs them (and who wants to accept them, I’m not forcing hugs on anyone).

*I know this was a vent, and I’m sorry I’m not asking for anything specific as far as feedback goes, I just really, really needed to try to get this out to a forum where I’m anonymous, and hopefully won’t get judged too harshly, since we’re all fighting this ED monster in one form or another. Also, apologies for typos. I tried to proofread, but probably missed some. I’ll fix them later if I see them.*

Struggling with loose skin after massive weight loss (F27),20,omqwhw,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/omqwhw/struggling_with_loose_skin_after_massive_weight/,10,"So I gained a lot of weight in my late teens, then lost a lot of weight, more than what I weigh now and naturally got left with some loose skin. I have already had one operation to remove it on my neck, and was told by my plastic surgeon that surgery on my breasts and tummy would most likely be covered by insurance if I wanted to get those operated on as well, which I definitely do. 

The problem is that it’s all I can think about a lot of the time, and the skin makes me feel ugly. Even when I was at a much higher weight, I had some excess skin and I remember thinking that I would rather be heavier without it than thin and have it. I guess I changed my mind at some point and sort of focused on numbers until I hit a weight where I had to recover or my life was going to become much more complicated, and since late last year I have been in recovery. My eating is okay right now, I’d say pretty normal. I have been maintaining for months. I could gain some more weight, I’m at the minimum “healthy weight” but the doctor I see doesn’t seem concerned and I eat whenever I’m hungry, sometimes even when I’m not and don’t deal with any other ED behaviors at the moment so I’m doing pretty well on that front.

But yeah, the loose skin… I think about it all the time and can’t wait until I can have more surgery to remove it. Like I said, the breast lift and tummy tuck (I assume these are the surgeries that I would have) are very likely to be covered by insurance, but I also have excess skin on my arms and thighs and was told that these surgeries I would have to pay out of pocket for if I were to get them.

Sometimes I don’t even want to leave the house because thinking about this makes me feel so down even though my clothes cover it, unless I were to wear sleeveless or crop tops which I never do. I’m not sure what to do about this. Obviously I shouldn’t base my happiness around this but it’s so hard not to think about these “flaws”. I have thought of joining a gym but I have other health issues that make working out difficult. Plus it would not remove the loose skin, only maybe make it a little less visible if I gained some muscle underneath it? I’m not sure but supposedly it has helped some.

When you’re not allowed an off day,15,omp9qt,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/omp9qt/when_youre_not_allowed_an_off_day/,0,"TW: discussion of restriction, no numbers

This, right here, is why I relapse constantly.

Because I’ve been pushing so hard and stuffing down all of my emotions I broke yesterday and slept A LOT. My body hurt to the point getting up was a struggle. I finally accepted I just needed an off day rather than push through it- a huge god damn feat for me.

I knew we had to cat-sit for a neighbor, but I was tag-teaming with my roommate and I had done the last two days I figured one day having her do it wouldn’t be the end of the world. Nope, woke up to passive aggressive texts that it would be really great that I do it (please note I was told after the fact we were sitting, so although I was chill with it I wasn’t the one who said yes).

So not only am I triggered because I “can’t have feelings” but the reason I got a passive aggressive text was she grabbed frozen shit from our friend who’s moving and filled our freezer. And to be careful about closing it.

Don’t worry about it. It’s not like I’m going to eat any of it. It might be the first time I say that out loud because I’m so fucking upset I’m not allowed to have an off day EVER. She’s been allowed to throw absolute tantrums that 1) been while I’m working and have to deal with basically comforting her while doing my job 2) trigger my trauma bullshit I have to deal with after. 

It reminds me I’m not showing emotions or telling her any thing since the last time my breaking made her just angry. I’m only allowed to show emotions when it fits her schedule. I’m glad your neurological condition is treated so you can function but mine fucking isn’t and I have to deal the best I can.

Oh well, I’m visiting family in a month and it’s a good constant trigger. Maybe I can drop a little bit before I go.",1626609840.0

Struggling - New Baby,9,omed0z,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/omed0z/struggling_new_baby/,5,"After having my son 2.5 years ago I lost a lot of weight and was mentally struggling with body image/calorie counting/over exercising. I started having issues with passing out frequently and was diagnosed with a couple cardiac issues and was told my body fat percentage was extremely low which was contributing to the cardiac issues. I saw a couple different therapists and was told I had anorexia, but I have a hard time believing that still. With Covid my gyms closed and I just wanted to feel normal again, so I stopped calorie counting and allowed myself to gain some weight back - I maintained that weight (middle of a healthy BMI) until I got pregnant again. 

I had my daughter 2 weeks ago - she came early and she fought for her life. She was extremely sick and had a 50/50 chance of survival in the beginning, but she is doing amazing now and will be in the NICU for a couple more weeks and then we will finally be able to bring her home. 

This situation was extremely stressful, knowing my daughter may not live was the most horrific thing I have ever went through. I couldn’t eat or sleep for days, and even though she is doing much better now I cannot seem to get back to normal eating again. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I can’t decide if this is a normal reaction to such a stressful experience, or if this is becoming an issue that needs addressed. I don’t want to make a huge deal about it, but my husband keeps saying how worried he is that I’m harming myself by not eating (I am eating, just not more than a couple hundred calories a day). 

Complicating factors: I am a nurse practitioner in the NICU where my daughter is getting cared for. My information pulls into her chart as they are connected. My colleagues see this information and I’m a pretty private person. 

My colleagues and the nurses are starting to notice my rapid weight loss. It’s obvious to people it isn’t normal postpartum weight loss. I’m embarrassed when people bring up my weight or size - sometimes they are complimenting me snapping back to a normal size, but I can tell others have concern behind their comments/questions. Colleagues are asking me if I’m eating - I know they mean well, I just never know what to say. The social worker is concerned. 

I have an OB appointment this week and part of me wants to tell her how much I’m struggling, but I don’t even believe I had an eating disorder before so I don’t even know how to explain why I’m concerned now. I also don’t want anything about this documented in my medical records as it will be visible in my daughter’s records, which as an NP or MD we read on a daily basis. 

I just don’t know what to do. I think I need to figure this out on my own, I’m just embarrassed and struggling. But part of me is enjoying the struggle because I have to lose more weight.",1626561579.0

I'm not in high school, I'm a grown woman who goes to school, has worked, and has other responsibilities to attend to in life besides my eating disorder. I have Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Purge Subtype by definition, and when we met I strictly restricted. When I met her I refused all food, I was in and out of hospitals with feeding tubes, all that crap. Now I do all the grocery shopping, I cook, I eat over 1200 calories per day, but I do struggle with maintaining a healthy weight and deal with laxative and exercise abuse. I don't binge but I do engage in compensatory behaviors that honestly I try to keep private from people outside of my family and a few trusted friends because a lot of people just don't understand anything beyond starving, vomiting, whatever they've heard eating disorders are. 

So my friend wanted to hang out this week and even though I literally cook dinner almost every fucking night for my family, go out to eat with them, all that shit, she makes everything about food. She looks at me and sees that I am underweight and just believes that I ""never eat"" and that pisses me the fuck off as I pour my creamer in my coffee and sit here in bed with my leftovers from last night that really pisses me off okay. She asked if I wanted to go out to eat or do something else and honestly with buying groceries and my car payment and my college tuition lately I'm not sure if going out to eat would be ideal because it does cost a lot of money that I could use towards groceries for us or my car or whatever I need, but I do want to hangout. I just don't want to spend a ton of money, you know? So I said hanging out at either of our houses is cool with me honestly (I can make myself food where ever I am, I have food at home), and she said the dumbest shit. She said she likes to go out to eat with me to ""make sure that I'm eating even when we're hanging out and not sacrificing my health hangout."" I understand the thought but she's done this a lot where she'll just randomly ask me if I'm eating and crap and it makes me feel super triggered by old feelings and like I'm being watched for how I eat? I try to eat relatively normally and my family and other friends don't comment on how I eat so this just makes me really pissed. I've explained to her that my eating disorder constitutes a lot more than not eating but this just makes me feel super invalid. The ignorance of it makes me feel like every time I voluntarily eat, I may as well just not even have an eating disorder if that makes sense and maybe it's just made up.

hiding under the blanket of ambivalence - tw suicidal ideation,16,oktb3w,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/oktb3w/hiding_under_the_blanket_of_ambivalence_tw/,1,"29F here. Been sick since I was 13. In and out of hospital twice last year for ED. Also tried to take my life last year on two separate occasions. 2020 was the worst year of my life. I lost my relationship, my dog, my house. My health. My mind. 
Since finding a more stable living situation I feel more secure but I am still struggling. It’s embarrassing to be this old and still doing this stupid shit. 
I quit drinking to quell the suicidal ideation. Checked into emerg 3 nights ago because I wasn’t feeling safe. I am determined to stay sober and not have a repeat of last year. But this demon eating disorder won’t stop sucking the life out of me. 
Is anyone else having trouble adjusting to the “new normal” re: covid?
My entire life collapsed in 2020 and I am not entirely sure how to rebuild it. I want to die almost everyday but am in DBT, see a psychiatrist once a month and the emerg nurse set me up with another resource I can use which was helpful. It was nice to be treated with kindness and compassion since I’ve heard so many horror stories about people not being taken seriously in those situations. 
The ED behaviours are becoming out of control again and I’m so good at hiding them that I just don’t care. My friend expressed concern the other day but I just don’t see it. I’m sad and grieving so many things and am literally taking it a day - sometimes an hour at a time. 
I weighed myself for the first time in weeks yesterday and the number is back where it was last year when I went to treatment the first time. Why do I feel like I need it to go lower now? Where do I think this will lead me? I legit fantasize about driving into oncoming traffic, having a heart attack at work or while driving, needing to go to the hospital again for my ED. And for what? FOR WHAT. nothing. Absolutely. Nothing. It’s so unbelievably frustrating. 
Does anyone just feel like they know deep down this is what will take them out, but they just don’t know when? Not to sound morbid, but I’ve always seen my ED as a slow suicide. It’s fucked up that that is a comforting thought. 

Anyway just needed to get that off my chest.",1626357231.0

I suck at budgeting. I’m hoping this gets better when the ADHD is managed but it’s a topic that comes up with us a lot; especially with my move. She made a one-off remark about grocery delivery and me reigning that in. She’s SO GOOD about not going there usually but she did this time.

Now, rationally, she has a point. It’s a more expensive route to take than just getting my lazy ass up and to the store. That said- then ADHD/executive dysfunction pops off and the likelihood I would wind up not eating increases. She has a point now that it’s safer to be out, and it’s possible this can actually happen in a month or two without me struggling to get going (fingers crossed I get medicated).

Fucking ED gremlin latched on and now it’s like “solve your budget by not eating!” So now every time I eat that thought is just blaring through my skull and I just want it to stop.

I’m restricting quite severely and lost around 10kg in the last 2 months. I wasn’t overweight or close to start with and will be underweight pretty soon if I don’t stop. The crazy thing is that I don’t look in the mirror and feel like I need to lose more weight. I felt I looked my ‘best’ a few Kgs ago and told myself I wouldn’t lose anymore. Yet I can’t seem to bring myself to eat more - it’s like the restriction has stopped being a means to losing weight and has taken on a mind of its own. I just want to get to the lowest possible number on the scale to prove to myself I can do it. I used to love food and have cravings all the time when I would diet before but this time feels different, like I’m having to force myself to eat the bare minimum I ‘allow’ myself. 

I feel silly going through this at my age. I have a demanding career and am putting that at risk by deliberately underrating, which is making me mentally foggy and constantly distracted. I keep hoping I’ll snap out of this like I have with the extreme diets I’ve done in the past but I just feel no desire to eat ‘normally’ at the minute.

If anyone has any advice to pull myself out of this fucked up mindset before I start spiralling even more, it would be much appreciated.",1625645885.0

She has a metric shit ton of medical issues and self-disclosed body image issues -- but I have never told her about my own ED/body issues. I kind of just listen when she talks about her stuff and try to be kind and supportive of her struggles, but I don't usually tell her about my own stuff. 

So, when I was trapped in a very long conversation with her recently, I decided to try to relate to her when she was going on and on about her medical stuff. I told her that I've gained some weight from some meds I'm currently on for some of my own medical issues. I feel like she went out of her way to tell me I'm ""so thin,"" and it just really bothers me. I'm at a ""normal"" BMI these days, and her comment just seemed like a weird, almost passive aggressive, thing to say to me, as she's smaller than I am. I'm objectively NOT ""so thin,"" even if I'm tall and therefore my weight gets stretched over more inches.

She and my SO have a friendship I'm largely left out of (this doesn't bother me, I think it's healthy to have separate friends), so I wonder if he's told her about my weight, food issues, etc. It makes me feel super self-conscious. I don't think he'd do it in a shitty way, if he did say anything, but I still feel a little awkward.

My partner is always trying to get me to eat more. Last week, my appetite was suppressed due to a change in routine and having a cold, and she started getting really upset at me several times per day, saying I barely touched my food. If I wanted to go on a walk, she would get on my case about how I'm trying ""burn it off"".

It's kind of messing with my head because I wasn't trying to restrict. I was trying to eat what I wanted. I wasn't forcing myself to exercise. She didn't believe me. She thinks I eat way less than her, but I think her perception is skewed. I think this is coming from a place of intense anxiety about the idea of me relapsing.

I feel like she doesn't truly understand what a relapse is because she's never really seen me do it. I've definitely had ED-type thoughts/behaviors during our relationship, but at a pretty low intensity. I've been taking recovery seriously and hitting my goals.

The only thing that calmed her down was when I weighed myself and I haven't lost weight. Actually gained (a small number of pounds) which I'm pretty pissed about because she's always making me eat more.

Honestly can't wait until we're back to in-person work/school, so I can make decisions about my own diet & exercise again. I want to get back to my pre-COVID activity levels and lose some of the (small number of) pounds I gained during quarantine.

In quasi recovery/harm reduction- how long will my body put up with this?,19,oamem9,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/oamem9/in_quasi_recoveryharm_reduction_how_long_will_my/,7,"Over the course of 15 years I’ve hit a state of full recovery for maybe a few months at a time. Lots of treatment attempts. I’ve been in a state of quasi recovery/harm reduction/ whatever you want to call it where I’m technically underweight, but I definitely am healthier than I was at my worst. Engaging in “just” restriction and an amount of exercise that would be considered healthy for someone without an ED. I’ve put my body through way worse but I know that’s not a reasonable justification and it doesn’t make my current behaviors ok.

Thing is, I recently went to my primary doc and got squeaky clean blood results and a clean bill of physical health. My doctor seems semi knowledgeable about EDs. 

So why, after 2 weeks of accidental extra restriction (due to some stressful life events), do I feel like my body’s at a breaking point? My weight is not down very much (surprisingly) and I am fucking ravenous all the time. I am fighting the extreme hunger because I don’t trust myself to refrain from purging if I overeat.

I’ve been through this ED shit too many fucking times. I’m tired of it and I’m tired of not knowing if I’m just being dramatic or if my body’s really trying to tell me something. What gets me is the clean bill of health from the doctor. There’s nothing immediately, biochemically wrong with me so why do I feel like my body is about to give up on me  :-( These are all hypothetical questions. I’m just frustrated.

So, instead of my new “half-time” in-office deal, I’m back full-time for the next couple weeks.

I’d been doing fairly well because I’ve been laser-focused on getting the ADHD treated... but it’s taking a long time (right now we’re cycling through non-stimulants, the next is strattera which I know due to my current meds + genetic testing will be a BAD time but I have a feeling my current psych will want to try it first... even though all she had to say when I mentioned my very valid concerns was we’ll have to do it “very carefully”.... fuck outta here). It’s more stressful than anticipated and I’m having a hard time.

After a weekend of nightmares (which I can no longer admit because then THAT will be the problem and I’ll be discussing an IOP I already said I can’t do), I started hopping back on my bullshit. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve been trying to cope in a healthy way, but it’s taking longer for me to try an option we haven’t looked at yet but my psychiatrist isn’t listening to anyone... not me, not my therapist or my dietician. I know I could manage better if I could remember fucking ANYTHING which is my biggest problem right now.

I’ve got my fingers crossed one bit from my favorite podcast will help me deal, but that’s asking a lot. Instead I’m using apps I shouldn’t and hoping my weight changes again. Great.

(For the record, with my raise/massive amounts of OT I’m pulling I’m looking into going back to my old NP who listened since it would only be for the next 11 months before I move. I now have the cash to swing out of pocket but I don’t know if she has space available yet).",1624875826.0

The last time I did a big summer shop for clothes was after my dad died. I’ve had ED behaviours since childhood (you’re a good teacher, Mum) and then after my father died to went full-bore anorexia. I didn’t even notice what was happening to my body until one morning I was getting dressed and my bra fell off. Then all of a sudden I *saw myself* and the ED brain said “yes good” and totally overwhelmed me. This was 2015-ish. My mother called me beautiful for the first time. My older sisters kept talking about my Ugly Duckling To Swan transformation. 

Eventually there was crisis and hospitals and interventions. My heart just about went kaput. But it all felt worthwhile. Even at the point when the weighloss started to scare me I still didn’t want to stop the behaviours. Then there was more hospitals and I spent most of the winter of 2017 trying to inventively leap the mortal coil. My weight “recovery” was tolerable until about 2019. But since then I’ve moved beyond the comfort zone/the BMI my doctors were begging me to get to and accept. 

Covid isolation and lifestyle change (husband and I have a farm so there’s way more physical labour in my life) mean my existing summer wardrobe 1) doesn’t fit anymore and 2) what does fit is all farm-grimy-stained. I have bulkier muscles in my hands so my rings don’t even fit anymore. 

**TL;DR: I need to purchase new clothes because the world is opening and I feel like my closet is disgusting. I feel like I am disgusting.

I'm on a lazy and pointless relapse and I feel joyless,62,o5jmqt,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/o5jmqt/im_on_a_lazy_and_pointless_relapse_and_i_feel/,12,"I lurk here often on my main account, finally posting my situ in case anyone relates <3

I'm 28, I had a severe anorexic career all through my teens and early 20s, multiple admissions and then I 'recovered'. Unfortunately I think I had a ""high"" year of bliss thinking all my ED was OK to put back in the closet so never really did any substantial work to make sure I sorted all my MH issues out, so I guess there's no surprise it's been lurking ever since.

Now, I'm relapsing. I call it lazy because I can't afford to give it everything, I have a job and I'm working towards a career I definitely want, now a days I can't restrict like I used to, it's too uncomfortable and makes life hard and I do actually have other responsibilities now, unlike before.

But I'M SO GODDAMNED TIRED. I'm tired and boring and bored and miserable. Everything is boring because with Ed comes the routines, the same routines every day but the prospect of giving them up is wayyyyy more scary than the monotony they cause. So it's just shit.

I feel like I've sucked the joy out of my life again but I have no motivation to gain weight or go through the pain of sorting it out. I think I have Ptsd from all of the occasions when I was forced to gain weight in hospitals and how horrified I felt to be sent back out into the world in a massive alien pile of flesh. Iv never dealt with those severe feelings of 'not my body' disgust other than quickly relapsing.

Iv gone back to therapy and for once, it's actually a positive experience, and I have such a great therapist. But I'm overwhelmed, I just see how much of a backlog of crap there is from my past, and also there's real issues with my present day life too, I just feel where do I even start, it's physically exhausting just talking about it.

I don't know what this post is for, I just feel super lonely nowadays because I don't ascribe to the old ED community because I don't really consider myself thst way, I'm a 'part timer' who's also trying to lead an adult life and feeling really beaten down.

Feels good to get it out, TY xx",1624356881.0

"Wanting to get free, but needing the coping mechanism",16,o5avvm,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/o5avvm/wanting_to_get_free_but_needing_the_coping/,2,"I started binge eating to regulate before puberty. Got in a better home situation and stopped, but it’s come up at different times (as well as other eating disorders). Since my last relationship ended a few years ago and friends moving away and disappearing into family life etc etc since I’m in my thirties, I’m more isolated and I emotionally eat much more. 

WFH during the pandemic, I am much more isolated, and I emotionally eat pretty much every meal, every day, when I’m on my own. Food calms me down and regulates me. Eg I had a bad dream; breakfast helps me calm down. Stressful meeting, lunch helps me calm down. Breaks without food do not have the same effect. 

To damage control weight and health effects, I volume eat and count calories and I can do this and stay at the higher end of a healthy weight range for my body. 

I’m going through old stuff at my parents’ house and there are notebooks from when I was anorexic as a teen. Half a dozen or so notebooks with meticulous calorie counts/food logs. It’s so sad. 

Lately, even before this, I have the sense of just wanting to be free of worrying about calories etc. Free of the whole thing. I think intuitive eating could be that pathway, and honestly I’d weigh less eating intuitively rather than stress-based. 

But - then what about stress? I’ve been in therapy most of the time since I was a kid. I’ve done self-help books etc on codependency, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia. I’ve done DBT. 

And still - the most effective thing I can do for myself to regulate is binge and purge. The second most effective is distract while stress eating. Maybe my nervous system is just really fucked from all my early trauma. Contact with safe people is really regulating but in short supply and never something one can count on having on demand. 

I want to get free but I really don’t know how I’ll get through the day.

Just curious if anyone relates or has been able to make strides in this.",1624325106.0

"TW: Relapse, worse than I thought",58,o4zj62,EdAnonymousAdults,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/o4zj62/tw_relapse_worse_than_i_thought/,7,"TW: I've been a Reddit lurker for a while, but not much of a poster, so forgive me if I don't use the right warnings. I'm in a bad place and I need to get some shit off my chest. I'll do my best to avoid specifics and hope the moderators will be gentle with me🤞
I (43F) have been sliding into relapse over the last year, but in the last 6 months things have gotten out of control. This last month+ has been especially hard. Despite opening up to 2 close friends, and acknowledging the need to stop restricting, I have gotten even worse. I haven't been able to make myself talk to my husband about this. Partly because he's trying to lose weight due to type 2 diabetes, and struggling really hard, but also because WTF - how is he not seeing this already? 
I realize my situation is devolving quickly. I'm at the tipping point, Y'all. Maybe even past it. I am at the bread & water stage of subsistence and nobody even knows! I'm stuck in that mental back & forth of wanting to get better, and of being enthralled by the visible bones. I'm terrified and elated.  I've been on a waiting list for a therapist for a while, and haven't heard jack shit about an appointment any time soon. I've reached out to a new psychiatrist (out of network, so $$$) in hopes of that being faster, but my expectations are low. I want to get better, but obviously can't on my own. I don't even know where this post is going. I just needed to ramble,I guess.",1624293965.0
