New Discord for r/AnorexiaNervosa!,10,sku9xg,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sku9xg/new_discord_for_ranorexianervosa/,1,"Hi everyone! So, it has been suggested in the far past that we add a Discord server for the subreddit. We decided that now is a good time to add one, and so we have been working on and are finishing up one right now!   


While it is an official server for the subreddit, those that are not a part of the subreddit are welcome there as well. It is not strictly for the subreddit. It's more like it's affiliated with it. In saying that, please feel free to invite others from outside of the subreddit if you feel they'd thrive in a supportive environment on Discord.   


The rules of the server are similar to the rules of the subreddit, so make sure you at least familiarize yourself with them upon joining to make sure you don't accidentally break any. We hope this server becomes an active, fun, supportive safe-space fore members of the subreddit and others to talk with each other. If you don't have a Discord account, it's free to use and free to join the server.   


We hope everyone appreciates the server and gets some good use out of it!

Motivation Event!,4,st6wzb,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/st6wzb/motivation_event/,1,"Hi everyone :) **We are also (attempting) to do this same event in the new subreddit Discord server**: 
https://discord.gg/DrFZaNSCxB 

While we are not a recovery-only subreddit (meaning only that we accept people at all stages as long as they respect the rules), we do like to spread some positivity and recovery motivation every once in a while.

We are only offering a small reward if you participate a certain number of times in the discord server. On the subreddit it's purely for fun and for some positivity,and 90% just for fun on the Discord. 

**The gist of it is this:**
If you have a recovery-themed image, advice, meme, et cetera, this event is all about encouraging you all to share them. Post it as an image/text post/link, anything, and just use the *""Event: Recovery Motivation""* flaire. This post should be flaired with that flaire if you want an example of what it looks like. 

Please make sure that if you participate, you read the rules and understand them! Regardless of the content matter, all posts breaking the subreddit rules and Reddit sitewide rules will be removed. If you see any rule-breaking posts in general, please remember to report them to help us get to them a bit faster :) 

We hope this event takes off and that everyone has some fun with it! We're a community, and we're all here for each other, each step of the way 💜💕

If I restricted on a crumb at lunch, my brain just goes ""so why didn't we do two crumbs?"" and it grows and snowballs from there. I've realised nothing will be good enough for my head because there will always be more restriction I could've done or less I could've eaten. It's inescapable and torturous and my head is in agony. I'm tearing myself apart. 

I'm so tired of nothing being good enough for those around me.

I didn't choose this. I'm so embarrassed and ashamed each and every day of the things I do to comfort myself when my head is being cruel, of the things I do to appease this illness. I've realised none of this will make sense to those on the outside. It's difficult and it's painful because I know the resentment is towards the illness and not me, but sometimes it can feel like their anger boils over and they hate me for putting them through this and not trying harder to get better. 

I'm just too tired now. Too tired to try any harder, any longer. 

Things aren't getting better. In fact, things are getting so much worse. And I'm tired.",1645383917.0

In crisis but still looking after my mum...,9,swuvof,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/swuvof/in_crisis_but_still_looking_after_my_mum/,6,"TW ; mentions of su1c1de & ED. 

Hi Y'all I just needed to vent. I am currently in crisis (apparently according to my GP, personally I am not really feeling like I am but I accept it, I guess). Just to preface I am currently under the crisis team (unfortunately) not that I will be reaching out to them for support; we have a historically rocky relationship that has contributed negatively towards my MH and added to my trauma. However I have said to them ""let's have a clean slate"" which they greatly appreciated but trust is earned and I truly do not trust them and I genuinely do not believe I ever will. I am under them due to feeling suicidal due to waiting for eating disorder services for 1080 days as an ""urgent"" case, their words not mine. Given the fact I've waited 1080 days for treatment I am failing to see I am urgent, let alone have an eating disorder or worthy of treatment. I fought so hard to get treatment, to better my life, to be free of its cruel dark clutch it has had over me for 2 decades plus now... 2 decades of everyone in my life failing to notice my eating disorder. I was invisible and I still feel very much that way. Anyway I am in ""crisis"" allegedly and I am still looking after my mum who is an alcoholic which I personally believe is due to trauma which ironically is at the heart of my ED. The cycle of generational trauma eh? I've spent all night looking after my mum who was completely wasted, I've finally managed to get her to go to sleep now. Thankfully. It's been one hell of a night! Anyway my GP is working on putting pressure on ED services to get me the support I need. Sorry about the long post and vent.",1645338974.0

At a crossroads regarding my ED,2,swuy4p,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/swuy4p/at_a_crossroads_regarding_my_ed/,2,"I’m at a crossroads with my ED and I would just like to get some of this off of my chest. It’s getting incredibly bad to the point where at any given point, I’m either unable to concentrate because I’m starving or only able to focus on binging and purging and binging again. I have maintained good grades up until this point, but I know it’s only a matter of time until I lose control and ruin everything.

I’ve already felt so pathetic and depressed for the past couple of days. Life has felt emptier than ever, and I’ve been dealing with passive suicidal ideation over my appearance. I don’t want to exist right now. 

The other part of me wants to completely self-destruct. I don’t care if I lose everything. It just wants to be beautiful and thin. And those are the only things that matter. My hair is thinning and I missed my period for the first time since relapsing, but that doesn’t matter because my body is receiving the punishment it deserves for being this nasty and ugly.  I don’t think I can be pretty without starving myself. 

So I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to starve until I can’t sleep and I can’t think and the other part of me wants to try getting better.",1645339245.0

Hi. I’ve been in recovery for 13 years for drug, alcohol and eating disorder. After a hysterectomy I gained quite a bit of weight in 2015 and I just can’t lose it. But before that, but after I was in recovery, I excessively worked out and orthorexia. I was on top of the world thinking it was recovery. In these last 13 years, I can’t ever seem to get the obsessive thoughts about my body and food to get better. It’s a constant thought. A constant war in my head. It ruins my days. I get so upset with myself for eating “bad”. I did eating disorder anonymous for a while, but it never helped with my inner dialogue. I hate this so much. Can you guys please share with me stuff that helps for you? I try all the affirmations. I try to always say something positive with the horrible thoughts. I try all that. It does not help the obsession or voices. I don’t care how others see me. I only care how I feel and see myself. But I can never see myself good, except when I was unhealthy or obsessively working out. I don’t know what to do, how to stop labeling every single thing I eat “good” or “bad”….I don’t know how to feel better inside. I keep saying all I have to do is workout insanely and I’ll feel better. My metabolism was tested and it’s the slowest on chart, so I need to basically kill myself in workouts but that leaves me not doing any because I work so much and out in Florida heat. I feel so defeated.",1645325389.0

I won't go into numbers here obviously, but I have lost quite a bit recently and I guess it's a little scary (if I am trying to think rationally about it). Not at my LW, but getting pretty close to it again. 

Should I tell him my weight? He doesn't know that I weigh myself (I have gotten better at it, only once in the last week!) He's also not like an ED specialist, so I don't know how much he knows about this stuff although he has been very supportive with it.

And everyone told me how great I looked. My boyfriend told me how petite and feminine I am. My pharmacist that hadn’t seen me for a few months literally didn’t recognize me.

I googled and saw hey we are supposed to lose like 100-ish hairs a day, and other people told me that is was probably fine. I just ignored it. 

Fast forward to today, my hair is barely there. It’s so wispy and light my mom even pointed it out. My hair used to feel thick and heavy and voluptuous and it’s almost gone. If I lose any more hair I will look completely awful. I’m barely getting away with the way it looks now. 

I just want to cry and cry. I am so depressed and sad because I’m so fucking stupid. One of the only things I had going for me, my hair. Now it’s just weak and broken and thin. If I start eating again today, it’s going to take months to reverse this.",1645220552.0

Extreme distress after gaining weight… hopeless,7,svy51y,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/svy51y/extreme_distress_after_gaining_weight_hopeless/,1,"Hello, 

I have been dealing with this disorder for a couple years.  I came into this winter with a real determination to try and do better.  And to get back to a healthy weight.  I’ve mostly succeeded at eating in a regular fashion - I force myself to eat three meals a day.  But now that I have gained some weight the whole mental side of it is so much worse.  I am constantly in a state of distress.. I hate myself.  Feel fat.  If I catch sight of myself in a mirror I feel so disgusted.  Food/weight are mostly all I can think about.. it’s really taking over my mind.. I dropped out of school and now I’m lying about that to everyone in my life.  And I have insanely strong urges to stop eating entirely.. I keep having the intrusive thought that “I would feel better if I was skinny”. 

I used to go through the cycle of starve/binge/purge (in my case I abused laxatives.. I went through whole boxes of them last winter) and I desperately don’t want to fall back into that life.  I have relapsed a couple times this winter but it was so much worse in the past.  

The worst part is I am a man and I have kept this a secret from everybody.  I can’t talk to any friends.. it feels intensely shameful and embarrassing to have this problem as a man.  I am terrified of people finding out.  

It feels like doing the right thing only seems to worsen my actual disorder.. that is so disheartening and I feel hopeless thinking about it 😔",1645234514.0

It's time to go take my measurements for my wedding dress to be made and the thought of going and seeing my true measurements at a tailor is horrifying. The pandemic has really fucked me over as far as self confidence and I've sort of unintentionally ""recovered,"" as in I've gained weight without wanting to and my BMI is at a low normal. My self worth is heavily dependent on my BMI being ""underweight"" even if I'm literally right on the cusp, but I'm not. I want to get back down to where I was before all this bullshit started but I don't know if I'll be able to in time. 

On top of that, I've struggled with IBS for ages and the fact that eating ANYTHING makes me bloat, whether it's air or water or just constipation, makes me feel like absolute shit because I can't tell if I need to lose more or if it's just bloat. I'm stressing out so much and work too much to have the energy to go work out or do cardio to speed this along a little bit. 

I miss the body I had before the world went to complete shit and I feel like my metabolism is shot now and I just want to get it back. I've been restricting but it feels like there's been no change in multiple weeks and the last thing I want is to feel fat on my wedding day, and look back on my wedding photos feeling like a cow. Seeing that my waist has grown about two and a half inches honestly makes me nauseous.

Sometimes I wish I could just sleep for a week and not eat anything during that time so I can get where I want to be.

Triggered Very Hard Over The Past Few Weeks,11,sv2mm6,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sv2mm6/triggered_very_hard_over_the_past_few_weeks/,3,"I’ve struggled with anorexia tendencies off and on because my hormones can really set off my depression and anxiety, but recently I’ve been extremely triggered by my mom, social media, people, and a YouTube video. 

I’ll save talking about my mom for last since she is probably the biggest factor in causing my ED. 

Social Media: the body positivity moment and how a lot of people talk down and are skinnyphobic and openly talk about their hatred for people who lost weight (I did lose weight healthily and maintained that prior to developing an ED). I feel attacked when I see that content on my page. 

With that to people in person I get glared at for being relatively thin looking at my weight because my bone structure is larger and my weight is carried lower on me. I’ve heard whispers of people calling me a ‘whore’ for walking by (I’m completely covered and not loose but not tight clothes) and ‘skinny bitch’ for eating the same food as this other girl. 

I’ve also lived with someone who claimed to be recovered from anorexia nerviosa and that did a large number to my self esteem. I drink black coffee and don’t like my foods complex tasting. I just don’t like much flavor. I add hot sauce to things so it burns my tongue so I don’t feel the texture as much. My roommate was a constant commentary on what I ate, wore, and how my body looked. 

As much as I have enjoyed Dorian’s videos on YouTube, the newest one with the Origen story of their ED triggered me when it was said about wanting to feel unconditional love. I feel like I’ve lost that love from my parents because (well there wasn’t much love to begin with) my sister had gotten chronically ill and it reminds me of when I was young because I was “the easy child” the one who could be ignored for hours and hours because I was good. 

I know that getting as sick as my mind wants my body to turn into won’t solve anything. It will hurt me more than it already has. 

My mom has been underweight most of my life. I never saw her eat breakfast when I was young unless we were on vacation. She had always been my biggest supporter of losing weight. She is taller than me and weighs less than me. It should be the other way around based on logic. I am my moms biggest competition and she is mine and she brings food into the house that makes everyone binge eat and complains when they gain weight. 

My mom is barely heathy for her height. She knows I can weigh less than her and be healthy by doctors. She told me that I shouldn’t lose more weight because I don’t need  too. I’m overweight. 

My biggest competition is my mom. 

My mom says I’m going to trigger my little sister, no mom, you gave all your children eating disorders. My older brother (AN). Me (Ana/ binge). My dad (binge but he was always kinda like that). My younger sister (binge)",1645140495.0

And sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical mistakes, I’m from Denmark ☺️ so sorry for the length!

I’ve been following this sub for quite sometime yet never posted anything. Even though I wanted to. I just don’t feel legit or like I actually have an ED. 
My head keeps telling me I’m just doing it for the attention and that I’m actually just a very bad and manipulative person at my roots. 

I’m obsessed with overanalyzing any mistakes I’ve done in the past, any wrongdoing and any bad thing that’s been done to me, trying to figure out if I was actually the problem all along and  just playing the sad victim. I’m scared that I can’t see my own flaws, that it was never anyone else, but me all along. That I’m not taking responsibility for the things I’ve done wrong. I’m so confused all the time and I never reach a solution! I just keep ruminating. 
My whole life I felt like an imposter, a cheater, a liar. I’ve never been able to appreciate or believe in any good things anyone would say about me. I feel like I’ve been playing a role that fooled them to believe I’m a good person or actually good at anything. I keep looking back at what I’ve sad and done in that relationship to cheat them into believing I am good person. 
I just want it to stop 😢 I feel so lost and disconnected from my self. I just wish to feel content. Happy. Or just good ENOUGH. I feel like I’m always wearing this mask, trying to fit in and being like everyone else is, because that has to be the right way. They are always right and I am always wrong. I’m so scared of hurting anyone. I even look at my two closest friends and their interactions, trying to see what’s okay to say/do so that I won’t cross any boundaries or to just know how to be. It’s like taking a hundred mental notes while taking steps forward in complete and utter darkness. Sometimes I wish the worlds language wasn’t  spoken but written. Everytime I’ve been out I have to charge my battery for so long. Like I can never just “be” because there’s always a bigger price to pay.

I am also diagnosed with bpd, but it doesn’t feel quite right, still feels like something is unexplained. A piece of the puzzle is still missing. I just don’t make sense to myself. But that might also just be me trying to run from the responsibility and the possibility to actually work through it or just accepting it. I am just so damn tired and I just want to feel like I fit in in this world 😢

Thank you so much if you stayed with me through the whole thing☺️💕

For some back story, I'm 20F and have had anorexia since I was about 4/5 years old. Obviously this has lead to a longgg list of organ, GI, muscular etc. issues. Well today I had my 2nd appointment with a gastroenterologist and the results for some biopsies came back and basically I have something that means I am extremely deficient in the enzymes that break down, dairy, sugar etc. And now I have to avoid heaps of fruit, veg, nuts etc. (Safer foods) and im vegetarian. My anorexia is happy that I get to cut more out of my diet but I've been struggling to keep even a small amount of food down and i end up in agony, vomiting for a few days before I  can even  try again. Because i already struggle to eat and am on the verge of another admission I'm kinda feeling like recovery really is impossible and I've caused too much damage to go back so there's no point trying.

I’ve been to therapists, psychiatrists, dieticians..the whole works. I’m back up to a relatively healthy weight(in my doctors opinion) currently, but I find that I’m still struggling to eat. I’d like to mention that I do not have body dysmorphia, as I can look at myself in the mirror and see that I am no longer me..but a frail shell of who I was before, and I do not think I am fat.

I don’t WANT to relapse, but I feel like alarm bells are going off. I’m struggling to bring myself to buy groceries. I have a lot going on at work, so I’m finding excuses to not eat. When I do eat, it’s minimal (not intentionally, I just don’t feel like it). 

I’m starting to feel that familiar ache of just being low grade sick for no reason. I felt insecure the other day and immediately compared my body size to the other person’s. I feel like I’m balancing on the edge of a knife. I don’t want to bring this up to my therapist because she would refer me out (doesn’t treat patients with EDs). 

I don’t know if I meant this as a vent or what. I know the easy answer is just go to the store, buy stuff that’s easy and nutritious, maybe even safe foods, and ride this out but I feel terrified at the thought of spending money. (I’m not eligible for SNAP by the way).",1645072213.0

now, i'm 22. i go to therapy, see a psychiatrist, and have been told to see a nutritionist to deal with my ED. my therapist and psychologist call it an 'eating disorder' but my psych has never diagnosed me, even presenting the typical symptoms of anorexia. now, i am considered clinically 'obese' due to my BMI, and although i don't 'look' obese, i'm definitely overweight.

honestly i never thought my self loathing would get to this level. i used to be so good at restricting, i had no binge urges, and lost weight drastically. then i tried to recover last summer, it went ok, but as soon as the school year started i relapsed, however i had unplanned binges a little bit more often. these unplanned binges slowly got more and more common and larger in size , until now i restrict all day and hinge at night. sometimes i try to fast to make up for it, which honestly just makes the whole cycle so much worse. tonight was my 4th night of binging in a row, after i cried off and on al day pleading with myself to just restrict . the thing is - all this binging has brought me back to my pre ed weight and i hate myself and how i look, seriously i’m overweight. i’m so upset because i know every time i tell myself i will restrict i know it won’t last long and any hope i had at loosing weight again would just have me end up gaining more. i’m so fucking frustrated and i’m honestly in a worse mental state than before and i feel so trapped. all i want is to restrict and lose weight again. anorexia, literally all i was and all i was good at is now gone, i’m at a higher weight than ever, and i’m not anywhere near recovered or even doing recovery. i feel so belt and so lost and like everything i ever think , do and feel is for nothing. it doesn’t help that. some of my friends struggle from disordered eating and they seem to be so good at not eating , and it makes me miss my old body and old ways even more. i never thought it could get worse than last year, where i was deep in my restriction, but these thoughts are so much worse. i feel worthless and like i couldn’t possibly have anorexia anymore something that has been my identity for so long . someone please just tell me i’m not alone and not going crazy.",1645013118.0

Others say it is a pseudo-religious ritual where the anorexia is used to distance the individual from society so that (s)he can grow and progress on his/her own.

I have a lot of triggers in my life. My wife and I live with my in-laws. We live in a household of 8. It’s already a hectic environment but I’ve struggled with anorexia on and off for 12 years. It’s always been rooted in a desire for control, which lends itself nicely to the obsessive compulsive tendencies that have been cropping up more and more lately. 

It’s impossible to keep organized in a house of 8 people. It’s impossible to have a routine or a schedule with 7 other unpredictable people. I work from home a lot of the time and it’s very difficult for me to be in the house without being triggered by something (arguing, messiness (sometimes downright dirtiness), lack of space and privacy, etc) but it’s also very hard to leave without being triggered by something (this outfit looks horrible, my hair is a shitshow, I look exhausted, someone just took the shower and now my schedule is ruined, etc). 

Over several months of being slowly worn down by the same factors, I’m just unable to handle it anymore. I cry all the time, the smallest inconvenience is a major trigger. Then I get more frustrated at myself for how unproductive I am after having lost minutes or hours to a breakdown. Which compounds the breakdown. 

My therapist switched practices in November ‘21 and stopped taking my insurance, since then I’ve been on multiple waitlists trying to get in to see someone, but everywhere is booked. I know Better Help is a fast and available option, but even with financial aid I’m struggling to fit it into my budget.

The thing is...I don't feel fat. I keep telling myself that if I were really Anorexic, I'd be having distorted images about my body. I'd be feeling like I need to lose weight. But I know I'm thin. 

It's not really about skinny for me as much as it's about being good at something. I feel like I'm not good at anything except controlling my weight. It's the one way I feel accomplished and ""better than others,"" as fucked up as that awful thought is. I know I'm not better than other people, but that's what comes to my head. 

I have such a complex about my intelligence, and I seem to use weight as a stand-in for this. I feel like I'm not as smart as my husband, so I focus on being really good at willpower, really good at starving myself.

I'm not sure what the purpose of this post is other than I needed to express it to someone, and I don't really have anyone outside my husband in my life. The poor man doesn't need to hear it again. 

The main thing that keeps me feeling like I need to make a change is I've started to have some cognitive issues that I worry will affect my clients.

I was diagnosed with Anorexia early January last year and stayed in hospital for about 3 weeks and currently I am engaging in FBT (Family Based Therapy). I have had many bad experiences with FBT. My parents were put in complete control of the food I was given (I was not allowed to make a choice in anything, it was horrible) and I did not really have the emotional support that I needed. I became incredibly depressed during the whole process of regaining my weight to the point where I started having suicidal thoughts and started cutting myself (did not tell anyone about the cutting though). I also had extremely bad anxiety and refused to leave my house because I was ashamed of my recovery body. As a result, I was advised to attend therapy sessions with a psychologist (different from FBT!), which did not help at all. She pretty much gave me advice that was pretty duh, or in your face. (For example, if I told her I was constantly comparing myself to others, her answer would be to embrace myself because everybody is different, which is quite a generic answer and wasn't helpful at all). After my weight was restored in June, I was finally able to get some of my freedom back and was able to get out of that depressing dark hole. 

However, recently, I think I am starting to fall back into my Anorexic tendencies again. It all started during the 2 month school break last year. I spent most of the time cooped up at home (because of my anxiety towards leaving the house as mentioned above) and as a result, started restricting again. I was originally supposed to eat a snack once per day to maintain my weight, but from one snack, it became no snack. And from there, I continued to restrict by not finishing some of my meals. I really don't want to go back into that deep hole that I was in during the weight restoration period, and neither do I want to continue doing this, but I just can't help it. I am also unable to turn to my family for support because the only way they know to do so is through refeeding using the FBT method, which also made me extremely depressed. I honestly don't know what to do and I am very stressed out about the whole situation. Was just thinking of sharing to see if anyone has had the same experiences.",1644658721.0

I constantly deal with the thought of my weight, my constant ""dieting"" and avoiding going out to eat with them has damaged relationships with my friends when they look at me weird and say I don't need to and I try to figure out a way to change the subject and then it's just awkward.

I feel miserable often, wanting to just eat some sort of a comfort food but then I just override my brain and eat something with as little calories as possible or drink a bunch of water to keep myself going. 

Always looking in the mirror or grabbing my waist to make sure my hands can wrap around and if they don't because I'm bloated for eating something or drinking a lot of water it sends me in a spiral.

And worst of all if someone mentions I'm too skinny it for some reason makes me annoyed immediately, I'm not sure if that's just because I don't see it and when I hear the opposite it just makes me uncomfortable or if the idea of someone judging my weight makes me annoyed 🙃 

If I'm in binge mode I refuse to look at myself in the mirror without a shirt on or get on a scale until I am a few days out of the binge

I'm in my mid twenties now and I was always small but had some mild leanings towards an eating disorder and now in the past year just bam full scale was hit with this just constant circular thought pattern of my weight and losing weight when I hit 5 pounds over my teenage weight average.

Date risking my recovery,77,spbpjq,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/spbpjq/date_risking_my_recovery/,7,"I went on a date late night that has really upset me and i feel like it's ruined the little bit of progress I made in trying to recover. It's been six months of REALLY BAD relapse. But in the past few weeks I've double my intake (which i want to clarify was done carefully), been more energetic and less depressed, and have stopped using laxative. 

Then, last night, on date #6 or 7, my date looked at my nutrition tracking for the day and saw the intake. (Point of clarity: I know nutrition trackers are not good for anorexia. But I am working one thing at a time.) He got upset. I told him I had warned him I was trying to recover from an eating disorder on our first date. And God damn him, he said the thing.

""Shouldn't you be way smaller if you're eating that little?""
No, it's a really common misconception that you always look like human skeletons, when really it changes through the course of illness. People look all kinds of ways and have anorexia. 

""But you eating that little and working out ... The math doesn't add up..."" 
It's not something I suggest, but it is something I've done for a long time. 


Essentially, this man looked at me and told me that I was not thin enough to be anorexic, despite having JUST reviewed my nutrition tracker. 


It made me feel like absolute crap. The thoughts in my head are horrible. Am I faking, should I starve more to be ""more"" anorexic? Maybe he's right and I'm just eating a ton and not tracking it or I need to work out more. 

I try to be honest about my eating with dates because most dates end up being about food!!! It's so frustrating to me that I WARNED HIM and he still walked straight into talking to me like I don't know my own business.",1644513567.0

You might as well go to r/stopdrinking and ask how to avoid liver failure without reducing alcohol consumption. 

Sorry, friends, but the answer is adequate nutrition. I welcome your comment about how goddamn hard anorexia is and how it’s not “just eat!” Believe me. I’ve been there, and I’m back there. Having an ED is not a choice, but our behavior is. Eating is a behavior we have choice over, no matter how terrifying and difficult and overwhelming the thoughts are. Simplified, but accurate. 

I’m disheartened (and angered) by the “advice” I see here on how to make actively engaging in anorexia easier. Allegedly pro-ana materials are prohibited here, so how is brainstorming ways to make literal starvation easier any different? If you are suffering symptoms of starvation because of your anorexia, it’s because you… are… starving. 

Start with dropping the “I *can’t* eat that.” Try on “I *won’t* eat that.” It reminds you of your power. Your independence. Your ability to choose. STOP with the false belief that actively pursuing starvation can be easy or comfortable. Trust me when I say that no matter what starvation symptoms you’re currently suffering from, it’ll only get much worse with further restriction. The only actual relief comes with even marginal positive change.

i wish it was possible to fully resonate with something before or without experiencing it

you will hear from others how bad you will get, how terrible you become; the body that you become, and yet nothing will scare me out of it until its irreversible and it's so.. and somehow, just like back then; i don't want to die right now, though it seems that i was constantly debating and waiting on that fact that i just want to be put out of misery. i hope i get reborn as snowflake— or a flower, you know?

Hi, my whole life I've had a bad relationship with food. I grew up around a parent with a binge eating disorder who has never sought help and another who would participate as well. I've always struggled with body image. I was raped a few months ago and afterwards I would have breakdowns and eat and eat uncontrollably until it was painful, then purge afterwards. I did this for a couple months at home and in public. I started going back to therapy and feeling better and it stopped. A couple months ago however I was trying to get out of a bad living situation and under alot of stress and began eating badly again. One day I weighed myself and saw I had gained weight and something snapped. Now I participate in many disordered eating behaviors and restrictions. All I think about all day long is food, I can think of nothing else. I get so hungry I act irrationally and do things that I don't even understand why or how I'm doing them. I've sought help, but it's a 3 month wait for an eating disorder clinic and my psychiatrist won't diagnose me because I'm not quite underweight and it's been too recent. I'm so tired, I feel so horrible all the time. I don't know what to do in the meantime to mitigate the damage I'm doing to my body. I'm wondering if anyone has tips that could help me while I'm waiting to get into the clinic?",1644335318.0
My observation as someone who had IBS-D and did a stool transplant to fix his microbiome,5,snkjhd,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/snkjhd/my_observation_as_someone_who_had_ibsd_and_did_a/,2,"After I had a salmonella infection and then took antibiotics, I could eat whatever I wanted and could not gain any weight. My doctor said that I had anorexia which I found quite weird. My finding is that anorexia is not just the psychological part but also the gut bacteria part.

My mom works at a clinic that cares for people with anorexia among other things. 

I read 3 books on the microbiome and spent sometimes 8 hours a day researching and reading studies on how to get better. 

Gut bacteria communicate over tiny electric impulses via the vagnus nerve to the brain.

Our own hormones serotonin and dopamine are also chemical communication substances and poop of bacteria.


So if you have gut bacteria living in your gut that enjoys having an empty gut, they try to convince your brain to keep it empty.

Too much serotonin makes you feel nauseous for example. 

It takes 3 months to do some changes of the gut microbiome...


When reading success stories about anorexia, many people say, that it changed when they met a partner. 


My point of view is that people transfer bacteria when kissing and when you kiss a partner that has a healthy microbiome in his mouth several times the partner will eventually transfer part of his microbiome to you

One food that anorexic people often get in clinics is yoghurt

If there is a small fallback, it does not matter at all since the journey of improving the microbiome takes long

Some people who have problems with their microbiome that just tried going to therapy once a month, getting a massage once a month and avoiding stress at work made some big progress 

The most important thing to invest in is your health since health enables all other things 

This is just my point of view after connecting several study results and observations but it could also be all wrong

I wonder if anyone experienced something similar",1644327732.0

I apologize if I forgot to include something I've tried to make sure that I've included everything in the trigger warning. This is also a vent, I feel like I should mention that. (also I can't remember but I might have told some of these on my old account but I doubt iy) and finally, I'm sorry for formatting, and possible grammar mistakes. 

So I was thinking back on what could've caused my ED and then I remembered that throughout 1st-4th grades I was bullied because my pants kept falling down in the cafeteria at school. However I can't really remember anyone ever bullying me I just remember that I was bullied or laughed at, which just makes me think that maybe my brain just made it up because I can't figure out if it actually happened or not.

However one thing I remember is that in 1st or 2nd grade my friend's phone had gotten stolen by some people at our school and they had sent a message from my friend's phone to me saying something along the lines of ""your pants always fall down in the cafeteria, you're fat"" I can't really remember what it I just remember it said that I was fat and about my pants falling down. I remember laughing at the message but getting this feeling of shame and disgust towards myself. 

Then when Monday came around my dad came with me to school and asked my friend's teacher to pull my friend out of class so we could talk. So the teacher did that and my dad started raising his voice at my friend, and I was absolutely horrified because I knew that my friend was most likely very scared. So I tried to calm my dad down and my friend explained that their phone got stolen and that it wasn't them who sent the message, and I think my dad might have been a bit skeptical, however I believed my friend because I knew they are very honest. The sad part about this is that after that, my friend didn't talk to me for a long time and only waved at me in the halls, and they found new friends to hang out with but we did start talking again however it was never quite the same. I still think it was probably because they were so scared of my dad they were probably scared that if they spoke to me he would yell at them again. When this was all happening even then I suspected this was the case and I was very angry at my dad for raising his voice/yelling at my friend.

I can't remember when this next thing happened though I believe it happened between 1st-3rd grade.
One evening I was hungry and I was alone at home with my dad because my mom was at work. So I was getting hungry and asked my dad for food and told me to wait until my mom would get home at 10pm then he told me he was going to go to sleep and to not call anyone to bring me food
(which writing this down sounds very weird which makes me question my memory but I do remember him saying something along the lines of that)

So I tried to wait until 10pm however I couldn't so I either called his sister whispering or I messaged her to bring me food and she did. I told her to quickly leave so my dad won't notice because I was scared that he'd notice that I had done what he said not to do. Sometime later I learned from her that he had indeed found out about it and actually yelled at her for bringing me food.

This next thing happened when I was 9-12 I believe.
So me and my mom were coming out of the shower and I told her that I was hungry and she just pinched the skin on my stomach and said something along the lines of ""this is what happens to fat/obese/overweight people's skin"" I can't remember if I ate that night or not.

This thing also happened when I was 9-12
So we were at our summer cottage (me, my dad, my mom, and my mom's mom) so my mom's mom was drunk and I was walking in the living room. She either poked or pointed at my stomach and said ""are you expecting your boyfriend's child?"" I was horrified that she thought I had a boyfriend and that I was pregnant. Due to this comment I changed the position I sleep in because I was scared that if I slept like that people would think I was pregnant (I slept on my stomach my hand was under my stomach but I was scared that if people saw that they would think that my hand was on my stomach)
later I also realized, that the comment also induced dysphoria in me, though I didn't realize I was trans for another few years. 

Then I started feeling like I was a horrible person and that I didn't deserve food. But it also became a coping mechanism for everything. After I got my period I started hating my body even more so I also coped with it by restricting. Then my period stopped and I started feeling like I had to restrict even more. Though it's been on and off, I think I'm fully back in my ED again, because I feel like I deserve this.

There might have been even more things/comments but I really can't remember because my memory is bad (idk if it's due to trauma)

Edit: I forgot to add that one of the reasons for why I developed an ED was so I felt like I had control over my anxiety.",1644230149.0
I’m slowly relapsing again after over a year in recovery,16,smfj57,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/smfj57/im_slowly_relapsing_again_after_over_a_year_in/,2,"I did really well after I got out of recovery in early Jan 2021. I was eating and taking care of myself. I was managing my Bipolar Disorder better too. It wasn’t perfect, but I felt at least partially like I was getting better because I thought I’d beaten my ED.

I was still incredibly impulsive though, and that led to a suicide attempt that broke my neck in late March. That ruined me. The new meds I was put on caused significant weight gain in a short amount of time. It didn’t help that I couldn’t really do anything except lay around due to my neck injury. They stabilized me mentally so that I didn’t want to die anymore, at least until about a month ago.

My psychiatrist had been doing telehealth due to COVID, so my weight wasn’t being monitored. When she finally asked and found out how bad the weight gain had been, she decided to change my meds again. I’ve been going through severe withdrawal for over a month now. Physically, I now mostly just feel tired, but mentally I feel terrible. I’m both severely depressed and anxious, and there’s nothing to do but wait for the meds to kick in. I’m losing the will to care for myself, including eating.

in terms of eating to the point of stuffed, i personally ate until i couldn’t walk or breathe without pain (would not recommend) and would constantly eat as much as i could for 2+ hours at a time before doing it again in a few hours. it’s tiring and disrupts your life completely, but recovery is so so worth it. i can eat normally now, my body trusts me enough to eat a “regular” portion of food.

in terms of weight, it does not matter about the numbers. extreme hunger can happen at any weight, it just depends on how you treat it. and you do not need to lose more weight, if you find yourself reacting like this because you are dieting then that means you are not eating enough or going long periods without eating, which triggers the extreme hunger. it is not a problem that you are not underweight, your ed is valid no matter how much you weigh. and wanting to be underweight is something you should try and tackle first before your eating (such as reminding yourself why you wanted to recover, for me personally it is for the negative effect i had on others and being exhausted of my behaviours). you deserve to get better, you deserve to mend your relationship with food and you deserve happiness. 

i know it might seem better to just listen to your ed but that just destroys the progress you have made. if you relapse, you are only going to have to recover again. i am wishing you the best, and to reiterate, you are valid, you have value, your weight doesn’t make you more or less deserving of recovery and that a healthy relationship with food after anorexia does exist !! :)

I’ve been in recovery with CAMHS (NHS ran therapy in the UK for under 18s) for a little over a year and as of last week i’m back down to the same weight i was when i entered recovery. 

I don’t think camhs is helpful at all to my recovery as they don’t really do talking therapy and only tell you to  eat more and follow a meal plan. I genuinely think I’d be able to recover in my own time but nothing is improving with CAMHS.

CAMHS have taken me out of education which has resulted in a big struggle in trying to apply to colleges due to really poor grades as well as put me on bed rest a few times which has caused me to lose friends as i wasn’t allowed to go and meet them.

need support,11,slntro,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/slntro/need_support/,4,"ive been fully anorexic/orthorexic for 3-4 years. within the past 6 months i think started recovery.

i think what made me start ""recovering"" was that i was truly dying and had no choice. i can't begin to describe how i felt every single second of every day. i felt like i was having a psychotic episode every day. i remember one day i was trying to eat a sandwich on my lunch break at work. it was just half a falafel wrap. i bought it the day before, ate half for dinner and saved the other half for lunch. i remember thinking it was wild that i had ordered something from a restaurant. i thought that was the worst thing i could have done, but i tried to convince myself it was ""progress"" in terms of recovery. i wasn't recovering at all. i was in the absolutely worst part of my ed and i can see that clearer now.

when i tried to eat it i remember staring at it and being suspiscious. i had bought it the day before, logically i know that bc why would i be eating it that day if i didn't buy it the day before? it wouldn't have sat in my fridge for days without me remembering. but while i stared at it it was like all the sudden i had absolutely no idea when i had bought it and how old it was. i knew i bought it the day before, but at the same time it could've been weeks ago. i tried to smell it to see if it had any odor if it had gone bad. i smelled it and i couldn't tell what it smelled like at all. if i thought about it smelling fine it smelled fine. if i thought about it smelling like it was rotten it smelled rotten. i took bites of it and could not tell how it tasted. i had no idea. if i thought it tasted okay, it tasted okay. if i then wondered if it tasted rotten, it tasted rotten.

i stared at it to see if it there was mold on it. i genuinely did not know if it would be moldy or not. even though i did buy it the day before. i actually bought it the night before. it hadn't even been 24 hours and it was in the fridge since i had bought it. i stared at it to see if it looked okay. for the life of me, i could not tell what it looked like. i had absolutely no idea what i was looking at. this was in broad day light and my brain just couldn't register a single thing. and it was like this every day for a very very long time.

i looked at the sandwich and i thought, what if it's blue with mold? and it looked blue. i thought, what if it's purple with mold? and it looked purple. i thought, what if it's bright green with mold? and it looked bright green. and so forth.

i ended up not eating the sandwich. i decided not to. but after my decision i had realized i had spent my entire 30 minute break trying to analyze this sandwich. and i didn't notice bc it felt like 30 seconds.

ive had episodes of psychosis so many times from this disorder. i showed up to my part time job one day and it felt like i was on 3 tabs of acid. i was stuck like this for 3 days. i genuinely was convinced someone drugged me at a concert i was at the day before. i showed up to work and i couldn't remember how to clock in. i just cried and cried. it was an opening shift thank god, so it was just me and my manager. he was actually super nice during this episode, which was one of the most embarrassing days of my life. i walked into this shift sobbing and i couldn't stop. i kept saying i need to go to the hospital. he asked me if he should call 911. i insisted he didn't and he hugged me at least 3 times. i feel like i owe him my life. i am so lucky he was there that day. i CAN NOT believe how amazing he was. i couldn't remember how to do anything. he ended up being able to find someone to come in and take my shift. i tried to do just one thing. i tried to stock the pop cooler. it seemed like the easiest thing i could do. i couldn't figure out how to do it. i remember i was hysterical and i kept telling my manager i was gonna leave and go straight to the hospital after i left. i kept calling my sister asking if i should go. she kept saying she'd leave her own job and drive and hour to where i was to take me to the hospital herself but i wouldn't let her. even tho i knew i couldn't go to the hospital myself bc my brain was so shot i had no idea how to get there/what i would do when i got there. i had no idea what i would say to the front desk. it was like i couldn't form full thoughts at all. when i ended up finally leaving the shift, which was probably just 30-45 mins after i got there, i didn't end up going to the hospital. i don't remember leaving. i don't remember going anywhere. it was like i blacked out and next thing i knew i was sitting in bed in my room in the pitch dark eating chipotle. i swear i don't remember actually going to chipotle.

idk how i haven't gotten in a single car accident the past few years. i should've gotten my license taken away. it feels like i havent been sober for even one minute for years straight. my brain is so gone. i was just in and out of psychosis for a year or two straight. just constantly.

i have family and friends. not once has a single person confronted me on my issues. i have been thin for a long time now. but a year ago i was extremely skinny and i had been for a year or two.

i started 2021 with covid. i was isolated for 2 weeks and it was the 2 worst weeks of my life. i was barely sick. my sickness lasted 8 hours, then i was just healthy and bored for the next 2 weeks. you go your whole life just WISHING you could be alone and forced to do nothing and be lazy for a week or so. i play guitar and for years and years i DREAMED of having some weird opprotunity where i could play for days on end. where i could have consecutive days off and have free time where i could play guitar for days. but specifically a vacation where i HAD to play guitar, so if i wasted days playing it i wouldn't feel guilty i didn't spend my free time doing something cooler, like going somewhere. this was such a specific day dream for years. never in a million years did i think it would become possible. then the pandemic hit and i had the chance to catch covid and be alone for 2 weeks with no other choice but to play guitar bc what else is there to do when youre quarantining in your bedroom? when i caught covid from work and quarantined i didn't touch my guitar once. i still can't believe it. i didn't touch it once. i was alone with my racing thoughts for 2 weeks and i genuinely just went insane.

the racing thoughts that come with ed/brain deterioration is absolutely unbearable. every day i thought i deserved euthanasia. i still think i did.

it was the worst 2 weeks of my life. just forced to be alone with my thoughts, and fully feel my brain eating itself every single moment with absolutely no distractions. i was so irrational and paranoid at the time i felt SO guilty for catching covid, as if i did it on purpose or something. i texted all my coworkers individually and sent lenghty apologies. they were all like, why the fuck are you apologizing...? it was embarrassing. i felt so bad. i cried for days and days  out of guilt of catching covid.

after that quarantine i finally decided thinking about recovery. it was just a thought in my mind, i wasn't acting towards it. but over time thinking about it helped me start it. about 6 month later i finally decided i truly couldn't take it anymore. i couldn't take the absolute lack of brain function any longer. i started eating a little bit more.

it's been another 6 months since i started eating a little bit more. it feels like it wasn't even a conscious decision. it feels like i did it out of absolute priminal survival. i still hate eating. i still think about what im eating 24/7. my life still revolves around it. i still look at myself constantly and notice every single possible tiny thing that could be changing about my body. i still feel disgusting having any fat on my body at all. but i can't stop eating more than i used to. i can't go back to being confused every second of every day. i can't go back to having every single sense completely shot. i still have no sense of smell. i still can't see as clearly as i used to. my body still doesn't have much sensation at all. i lost my virginity during all this and i didn't even know it happened. you dread the pain of losing your virginity your whole life until you do. i did not know he was inside me. i can't go back to my mind racing as fast as possible every moment of every day. i can't go back to feeling like im tripping on acid every second of every day and questioning my reality every moment. i can't go back to every thought being in existentialism. i can't go back to my brain literally not registering the things i see on a daily basis. i can't go back to hallucinating every single day. i can't go back to having absolutely no depth perception. i can't go back to my skin falling off of my hands and face every day. everyone in my life has thought i was addicted to hard drugs for the past few years. i can't go back to physically not being able to get out of bed. i can't go back to laying in bed every day feeling an immense amount of peace that was unworldly. indescribable. just completely okay with every single thing imaginable. i know now that in those moments i was at peace bc i was ready to let go and my brain was comforting me in the process.

ive gained weight. probably not enough, but some. when i look in the mirror i feel like i look a normal, thin weight. i feel disgusting every day. i hate every part of fat on my body.

the worst part is my boyfriend seems to also be anorexic. i want to break up for this reason alone. i can't be with him if he's still engaging in this behavior and i want to recover. it's the most disturbing thing ive ever been through. no one in my life ever talked to me about my issues. i feel like im complaining bc im mad they didn't give me attention or something? but since ive recovered some i have seen old photos and suddenly can really tell how bad it was a year or two ago. and im just so disturbed that no one talked to me. i truly have no one in this life. then i get into a relationship and it helps my issues a ton. but at the end of the day he's anorexic too. it feels so unbelievably disturbing. the sickest joke imaginable.

sorry to write a novel. i just needed to vent. i have no one to talk to. this will probably get removed. or no one will read it. i just feel awful every day.",1644115087.0

The Age I Develop my ED,15,sl7r6s,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sl7r6s/the_age_i_develop_my_ed/,3,"I think I'm realizing that my ed goes way back before the age I thought I developed it. Maybe it wasn't a full-on eating disorder at the time, but it was disordered eating. I remember as young as 5 years old seeing myself as fat.

And when I was just 11, I started skipping meals. I remember it was partly because of depression. I was depressed at the time and was being bullied, and I just thought, ""well food won't make me any happier, so why should I even eat.""

And maybe that's not an eating disorder technically if it's because of depression, but it is disordered eating to skip meals for whatever reason. And I would exercise sometimes until it made me sick. And I would also always wish that I was thinner. Then when I was 14, I learned about fasting.

And every once in a while, I would try to go through a whole day without eating. And it doesn't help that at this time, my mom's friend who lived with us would always say to me things like, ""you're really gonna eat all that?"" ""All of that is just for you?""

""You're eating again?"" ""You're gonna get fat if you eat like that"".

But I hate them. I’m not a religious person so all of the talking about god is a complete turn off for me. I went to Catholic school growing up all the way through high school and the meetings are structured so similarly to a church service. 

I also am not much of a sharer with strangers. And by not much, I mean not at all. I’m also even less of a cryer around strangers so to sit in a room and to talk about something I’m struggling so much with is just an absolutely off putting idea. 

I am seeing an ED therapist so it’s not like I’m just refusing to talk about my struggles at all or refusing to get help. But ooooooo I hate meetings. 

I love my partner very much and I am so appreciative of his support. He’s driving me 75 miles today to attend the nearest meeting. So I want to be more open minded about it for him.

But I have friends that have gone through this, I've read the health risks, and I've seen the stories people are posting on here. I know that for my own health and concern from those who love me that I shouldn't do this.

But I'm am. As a trans woman I have become dependent on the attention people give me for being beautiful, and I feel like I was losing that and that I need to get back to a weight where I'm happy.

My whole story given, and knowing that I'm going to do this, I want to reduce the harm that I am doing to myself and I have no idea how to while still losing weight.

It just feels so gross to put things into my body for my mouth rocks to grind into a paste that I then have to swallow.

Ive been super anxious about going downstairs when my family is awake and only recently admitted that I’ve been “feeling a bit nauseous today.” 

I’m kind of at a loss of what to do. I know I should want to eat. I usually love food, so this is really weird. I’ll smell something I normally love, but the second it’s in my mouth I’m disgusted.

is it possible to enter a partial remission of sorts without making active steps towards recovery? 
im in a phase ig of what would appear as getting better. iim currently gaining weight i think & although id be devastated if it passed out of the UW section on the bmi- (even though its bs), im still not restricting too compensate that much. im not really using many compensatory behaviours but i do still keep certain food rituals etc. 

i am probs stuggling way more than i think. like food is still 24/7 my thoughts the plans too restrict are always cropping up. whenever my eds challenged like eating out & staying away it seems too panic and get worse, but other than that im eating at least maintenance i think and always end up stopping tracking throughout  day because i just loose the reason too. 

i think what i worry is that since right now im not struggling too much compared too other times in my ed, that this current phase wasnt improved though engaging or planning too 'recover' in the sense off WG and less disordered behaviour etc do i even still have an ed like is it still there lurking for the opportunity too grip me again. Is possible for it too quieten for periods of time but like once you've got it you'll have it in whatever form until you commit too a full recovery?  i don't plan on staying in this phase, im just waiting until other circumstances push me down the ed spiral again.  i worry was it even that bad throughout all the different cycles ive been in over the last 18 months if im sometimes able too reach this point of less disorderedness ? and reaching a healthier weight by myself. Will my ed always be there in some form until i start recovery and commit too full recov? god i hope it is😳

Advice,6,sk0stb,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sk0stb/advice/,8,"Hello; I am coming to this Reddit for some much needed advice. 

A friend of mine is suffering from anorexia and is what I feel to be in a position of no return without strong medical intervention. She was admitted into ACUTE in Denver one week ago today, and after showing no improvement and refusing one supplement, they’ve told her to go home and that they will welcome her back with “open arms” if she is ever ready for treatment, and have referred her to palliative and hospice care back home. 

I am gutted and angry at this decision and even though this is not my fight, she has so much life ahead of her that I cannot help but want to advocate for her to be readmitted to ACUTE. She is considered SEED (not sure if I used that in the right context) and cannot get any treatment in her home state; all of the therapists she has attempted to speak with won’t accept her due to her low weight. 

I am coming here for any advice at all. She is going to die without help, and if the one place she can go for help isn’t an option, what’s left? Is this really the end for her? 

I have written a 2 page email that I intended to send to the admissions staff at ACUTE, but I’m worried about infringing on her privacy as she asked me to wait to send it to whoever the ACUTE staff forward her too, but if they’re just forwarding her to hospice then what are they going to do with my plea for readmission? Should I just send it to admissions or do you think it is a lost cause? 

Also if anyone has any experience with how to comfort or help her in anyway right now I would gladly take that as well. 

Thank you guys and I hope recovery finds all of you ❤️",1643939017.0

Attempted suicide at lowest weight ever  
A few weeks later finally released from psych hospital where I was forced to be  
Committed to recovery  
Entered residential care for 3+ months  
Diagnosed with anorexia binge-purge type  
Dismissed from residential  
Started therapy  
Immediately returns to binge-eating patterns but this time without ""compensation"" (purging/fasting) and as a result, rapid and uncontrollable weight-gain  


Every week I report to my therapist that I have failed what I promised to do. I feel like a lost cause and waste of time. Accountability is doing nothing for me, instead it just makes me feel worse. People are commenting that I wear the same clothes a lot. Well, that's because I have no clothes that fit me anymore. The weight gain is out of control. I feel that my only choice is to relapse. I feel that I am physically incapable of eating normally. For so many years, I have learned to stuff myself until I'm sick and and then fast for several days and repeat.

Ok so, I'm in Uni right now (first year) and its currently midterm season so I've been pulling lots of late-nights and stuff. My eating hasn't changed too much, but lately I've been feeling just absolutely horrible. 

I don't know what it is, I can't tell if it's the lack of food or the lack of sleep, but I feel nauseous, dizzy, tired and almost feverish a lot of the time. I went for a run the other day, and it was the worst I've felt in a while. I run pretty frequently and I like it a lot, so I'm really hoping it isn't my body starting to shut down b/c I don't want to lose that. 

I am at a very low weight, I will admit. Probably the lowest I've ever been. I just don't want to be too dramatic about this situation if it turns out to be nothing, and I don't want to really tell anyone about it because what if it's just stress? Idk. I'd try talking to my mom but she'd just tell me I need to eat more, which like yeah I know but I don't want to.

From AN, Orthorexia, and BED, i am no stranger to it. I remember when i first started my innocent weight loss journey in 2019. i started in january and told myself that i could eat sweets on valentine’s day. i had to cheer that night and my stomach (irrationally) felt “larger” than normal, so when i got home i ate some cauliflower rice since ya know. However, it made me feel “fat” and i tried to purge. i sat there at the toilet balling after 5 minutes of trying but only getting saliva to come out. 

I told myself then and there that i would never be bulimic. It was so terrifying and soul crushing. 

That was until today, 3 years almost exactly later. I felt guilty for eating yogurt cheesecake flavored, and it wasn’t what i was expecting it to taste like so i threw it all away and went to the bathroom immediately. Keep in mind i just got off the elliptical because i already felt “fat”. i couldn’t make anything come out again. and i tried. so hard. i don’t know if something is actually wrong with my uvula, or if my body is just freaking a beast at rejecting vomiting, but it’s frustrating. 

also note that i do not want to be bulimic. i wanted to vent and see if anyone else relates or has a similar story. you are beautiful inside and outside all day everyday. you are worthy of the energy you need from food. you are worthy of joy and love from others <3 you got this",1643579183.0

One of the biggest things that has always contributed to my eating disorder is substance abuse, I'm working on getting clean from a variety of substances but mostly methamphetamine & I'm about two months in. 


Recently (in the past few weeks) I've started dropping weight very quickly, even worse than I was when I was actively restricting. Eating has also started to become nearly impossible. It's not that I don't want to, I'm not scared of gaining weight anymore, I just can't get myself to eat & I'm not sure what's going on. 


I've also always used psychedelics rather heavily, I've found that high doses of acid, mushrooms, etc. have helped me gain insight about a lot of things esp. related to my mental health. To this day I still tell a lot of people that psychs are what got me off harder substances. 


While I don't consider that side of my drug usage to be negative, it's the only thing I can think of at the moment that could be contributing to my sudden weight loss. 


If anyone has experienced anything similar, or has any tips for not falling back into it all again, please share them. I'm honestly really anxious with all this going on & don't know what to do. thank you so much 😄",1643559113.0

At that point I thought I would recover, I thought I could recover.

However as you can probably tell I don't think that's the case. Sure I don't do any of the behaviors anymore I also try to eat normally and I don't feel guilty about eating. However in the back of my mind I have these thoughts ""I want to restrict"" ""I want to stop eating"" ""I want to start weighing myself again and measuring myself again"" I look back at when I was deep in my anorexia a few months ago and think ""I want to go back to that, back then I suffered, but I deserve to suffer and I had control over my anxiety"" but I also think ""No no I don't want to go back it's hell""

No matter how much I try I feel like I'm slipping back into my anorexia, I force myself to eat (or I get the feeling that I have to eat) so I eat. But that doesn't make anything go away, I think I partly stopped doing all the behaviors due to how exhausting it truly was. But now, I just want to go back I want to go back to suffer I want to go back to doing all those behaviors I want to be in control of my anxiety again.

But those thoughts make me feel even more anxious, because I feel like I'm just seeking attention why do I want to do the behaviors anorexic people do? I feel so bad about those thoughts and I'm really sorry.

Okay so I'll just end this post here this is all over the place I just wrote whatever came to my mind so I'm sorry if none of you can understand me. Also I'll just add this here I'm a trans guy so please refrain from calling me a girl, thank you, and again I'm sorry.",1643533571.0

It’s so tiring to see myself compare my body to others and make it into a little “who’s skinnier competition” and then start restricting. I don’t have any energy to do the smallest thing and getting out of bed to do anything feels like the biggest chore, truly the hardest thing to do. My digestive system is so messed up and my stomach always hurts even when I eat it hurts. These things aren’t even half as bad as the comments my family make though. They come up to me and start touching my body and feel the bones and make a disgusted face and say “why don’t you just eat” or “why are you doing this to yourself” “oh you’re just bones” “you need to eat more”. My mom has resorted to straight blackmail, she says stuff like “if you just gain a few pounds I’ll buy you this or that”. It’s not that easy, when I look at food it looks like a forbidden thing like a little hidden monster. I wanna eat and I wanna taste it and enjoy it but then if I go on the scale all my “progress” is going to be gone. I keep telling myself if I lose a couple more pounds I’ll be perfect but when I reach my goal I tell myself no just lose a few more then you’ll look perfect. It’s an exhausting and vicious cycle that I can’t seem to be getting out of. I got better a few years ago but then it came back all of a sudden and now it’s been two years of comparing myself to others and being completely helpless against myself. But then again I feel like I only have my weight that I can control everything else seems to be out of my sphere of control.

why is it so hard to eat?,9,sfr7wp,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sfr7wp/why_is_it_so_hard_to_eat/,4,"hi everyone

when i was 15-17 i developed anorexia nervosa out of my desire to look pretty/skinny enough for a guy i liked

i'm now over that, one of the reasons i stopped intentionally starving myself is because of my multitude of chronic health problems that keep worsening

when i would starve myself, i was hungry but i would not let myself eat. now, i'm not hungry at ALL, food makes me nauseous but i try to force feed myself 3 meals a day no matter what they may be in content or amount.

it's so hard to eat, i don't have anorexia nervosa now but i am anorexic, the singular word simply describing my tendency to under-eat/not be hungry. 

i'm so upset at myself, i'm so disappointed in myself for having been perfect and more beautiful back then and now i am here with a slim stick body and a damaged Central Nervous System with a dopamine deficiency caused by my ED

i wish i never met this guy i starved myself for, he never ever even called me beautiful. i was fine the way i am, it wasn't worth it, it wasn't right.

my parents get so mad at me for not eating, i try to do my part but it's not enough for them that i don't ask for seconds or am the last in the family to finish dinner.

i dont know how i'm going to get an appetite again. i cant enjoy food because of my dopamine deficiency and damaged CNS. i also have a compromised immune system which may be in part causing my low appetite.

it's so fucking hard, eating is required to live but it's such an excruciating part of my day. it makes me feel sick physically, and upset mentally because i can't eat like i used to.

i know i don't have my eating habits as bad as you guys, i just had to let my thoughts out to people who could understand me. my friends don't really have experience with stuff like this, their response to this ED is ""why can't you just eat? food tastes great why wouldn't you eat what's your problem"" blah blah blah

Additionally, I’m getting blood work done mid February and want it to be as good as possible. That said, I’m hoping I can have the occasional glass of wine or mixed drink out with friends after my doctor appointment, but am scared about how it may affect the bloat/swelling. Does anyone have any experience with the severity of the effects of alcohol on the body in early recovery? (I know we aren’t medical professionals, but all the google searches bring up articles on alcohol abuse and ED, which is not what I’m looking for🙂, so I thought I would come here for personal testimonies).

It’s weird to remember there was a time where I was ‘normal’,63,se7jb6,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/se7jb6/its_weird_to_remember_there_was_a_time_where_i/,3,"I remember the time in my life where I didn’t think twice about eating, where I didn’t feel guilty after I felt full. I didn’t care about losing weight. My favourite thing in the entire world was going out to eat different things with my family on the weekends. I remember swallowing the snacks and not spitting it out. 

Now all those feelings feel so distant; has it really been that long? 

Now every ed thing I do is normal to me, I couldn’t ever imagine doing it a different way, and I don’t understand how past me did all those ‘normal’ things without feeling guilty. 

If I stop and think about it…. What is wrong with me me? I am so messed up and it never occurs to me that what I’m doing is not normal. 

Food is meant to be swallowed. You’re supposed to eat during the day. 

I think about these these things but why is it that I don’t want to recover? Why do I still want to keep doing this for as long as I can?",1643314541.0

but ever since I've put on weight, I feel like I see myself completely different to how others see me. I feel pretty good most of the time but occasionally I will look at myself and think that I am 'plus size'. not that there's anything wrong with that but I just know that I am at an average weight and I don't know why I keep thinking of myself as overweight or obese when people still call me slim. I wish I could see things from others point of view.

I just can't help feeling like I'm double my actual weight. it makes me so upset but I feel like Im somehow being fat phobic even tho I don't have fat phobia towards others. I never looked at 'thinspo' because none of it ever made me feel any different. it's only myself that I feel is 'fat' and 'disgusting'.

I've not spoken to anyone about this because I don't know how to bring it up or even explain it. I can't explain how I feel generally probably cause I'm autistic but I dunno, I never know what is 'normal' or not because I only know my own experience.

I just can't help feeling so down and disgusted with myself. like I still have been eating normally but it's just those thoughts that bother me, but luckily it hasn't made me change my actions.

Sh relapse after telling my friend about my ED,5,sed9k4,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sed9k4/sh_relapse_after_telling_my_friend_about_my_ed/,5,"Last night my friend and I were discussing me being anemic because I’m constantly dizzy and lose my vision with the slightest movement. He asked if I was anorexic I told him yes. He doesn’t know much to anything about EDs but he looked up what causes anemia and decided to ask. 

He wanted me to explain it so I tried my best. I told him how it consumes you and even though it’s killing me I get comfort from it. I admitted that at this time I don’t want to recover I’m not ready to. 

I know he meant well but you know how annoying and frustrating it is when someone just doesn’t understand. And tells you things like “Just eat” 

He suggested things like to throw out my scale (impossible that’s my baby I weigh myself after every trip to the bathroom) 
“Try not to think about it” 
Told me I shouldn’t hide it from my parents and that I need to talk to someone like it’s that easy. Asked me do I really think people will find skin and bones attractive. And to give him my blades like they don’t act as my cigarettes. “If you know you’re going to purge just don’t eat that much” As if any amount of food isn’t too much. I know he just doesn’t understand that purging is an impulse and that my brain won’t stop screaming at me unless I purge, sh, and so on. 

But it took a turn
He asked more questions that seemed obvious like “You think about it 24/7?” Duh. We talked about how I restrict and purge instead of binge and purge. I told him that in 2018 my ED almost took my life explaining how it’s something I’ve been struggling with for years. I felt safe with him. 

He begins to tell me about how he’s scared and can’t afford to lose me. Typical reaction I understand that and I feel terrible for upsetting him but then he expressed how if I were to die he would kill himself. I immediately told him to stop but he carried on telling me how serious he was and without me he would be alone. 3 more times I told him to knock it off and to stop talking but he wouldn’t and went into more detail and swore how serious he was and said he can’t live without me. I SPIRALED I told him goodnight and said that I had to stop talking to him for the night because I was triggered and sent into a full on panic attack. 

That sent me over the edge. I destroyed myself last night after our conversation. I was so angry and I still am. I know in his own way he means well but I just can’t handle the way he’s going about it. When I stoped replying he blew up my phone. I’m ignoring him. I don’t know for how long but I need space.",1643329636.0

It was not because you were vulnerable, as you still are nowadays. But because you dared to fight, no matter how hard it was, day after day. 

It feels like I failed you, I tried to understand you. I listened to you, looked at you... I loved you & I fought for you. I fought against those demons. But that was apparently never enough. No matter how much space I gave you, no matter how much time passed. You never really opened up towards me.

And the strange thing was that I accepted that... I accepted this because I knew how tough you had it, I understood that you weren't fighting for us. So long as you were fighting for yourself & you could see the happiness standing in front of your eyes. The things you had achieved in your life. Yet, it was never quite enough, you hesitated about each step you took and you changed time after time.

Eventually it became my turn... Was I standing too close and did I know too much? Or were you scared that I would hurt you after everything?


Perhaps it is obvious and I wasn't quite good enough.

It’s strange, the last time it got especially Bad™️ for me i was unemployed + feeling isolated in quarantine and abusing prescription drugs heavily as well so I was a lot worse off mentally. 

Now I’m much more “functional”, I have a full time job (in a restaurant, ironically) that I’m actually good at. I have a stable income, I’m holding down friendships instead of ghosting people and fucking them over, I’m moving soon, and on top of that I’m going to be going back to college in the summer. I’m a lot happier and calmer just in general now and yet I have this problem still. I think it might’ve come back as a subconscious way for me to regulate all the stress I feel from life right now and to numb my anxiety. 

Suffice to say despite all that I’m spiraling again lol. I’ve passed my old LW and I’ve started to feel physically unwell too  (lightheaded, brain fog, the occasional tightness in my chest and tachycardia, etc. the works) I was always a pretty “healthy” anorexic before even when I was eating much much less and losing weight extremely rapidly but I guess that’s catching up to me now in my early 20s bc I’m not a teenager anymore. I don’t know what to do. I need to keep working so I can afford to live lol, taking leave from my job to go to treatment would be challenging financially. I know for a fact I don’t have enough money to pay out of pocket and I don’t know if my shitty state health insurance plan would cover anything. 

Im also deeply paranoid about my coworkers finding out. I know some would be supportive but I’m afraid of how people would react in general. If I did go to treatment my parents would probably try and force me to stay at their house after/if it was php and that’s literally the last thing on this earth I want to do. They wouldn’t trust me to live alone I’m sure, but they’ve also enabled my disorder very heavily over the years and I’m 100% sure they’d continue to do that so their house wouldn’t be a healthy environment for me to be in at all. 

I need to do something bc if I keep going like this I’ll lose all the stuff I’ve worked so hard for, I have no idea where to start honestly. I’ve attempted recovery before on my own and it did not work out well for me at all so I don’t think that’s healthy or in my best interest. I need to see a therapist or my old psychiatrist but they’d probably push to admit me to residential and like I said before, that’s not really an option that’s feasible for me.",1643320098.0

Really Scared of Recovery,22,sd811w,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sd811w/really_scared_of_recovery/,2,"Hi all. I’ve been lurking for a while and am in desperate need to get this situation out there and maybe someone has some advice or support. 

Basically, I’ve been dealing with anorexia for 10 years now and am finally in a better living situation- away from past memories- that has been allowing me to deal with other mental illnesses in a healthy way (depression, anxiety, PTSD). My closest friends know I also struggle with anorexia, but I haven’t fully recovered yet. When I was at my lowest I was forced to eat up to a healthy weight but that never got me recovered, just gave me a chance to hide that I still was battling the disorder. 

My best friend also has an eating disorder, but it’s the opposite attitude of mine - isn’t eating enough but wants to eat more. That’s one of the things I admire about them, in a way. Lately we’ve been getting meals regularly together and they know I’ve been uncomfortable at times since it’s more food than I’m used to, but I was focused on helping them eat more and it’s been helping me to think less about what I am eating. Despite that though, I’ve been falling into a relapse over the past month.

Lately they’ve been trying to get me into weightlifting. My history with that is not positive. I’ve had the exercise obsession for many years but it’s always cardio and body strength- never dumbbells and other weights. I’ve told them it’s genuinely terrifying for me to pick up those weights knowing most likely I will gain weight but they believe that me gaining that weight will help me focus more on how my body looks rather than the numbers. I’m incredibly scared of this and no matter how many times I try to explain it they don’t understand why I’m so scared. Something else that bothers me about it is I know they like how people who lift look and so a part of me is wondering whether this is something they want out of me. The motive is supposed to be to help me but I guess me knowing their preference also makes me hesitant.

I’m already going to a therapist for past trauma and they also know the anorexia exists but we haven’t even started to cover it yet. I’m wondering if I should go to an ED therapist. I just want to be understood and I need reassurance and support that I’m doing the right thing. I’m worried that jumping into weightlifting might make the relapse I’m battling worse, or even further the trauma of what happened the first time when I was rushed into recovery (being force fed). 

Does anyone have any advice on my situation? Should I get an ED therapist? Is there a way I can help my friend understand how scary this is for me?

I have struggled with an eating disorder for around 6 years now and maybe a little over a year ago I was in an okay place. I still thought about everything quite a bit but it wasn’t at the forefront of my mind at all times. I have opened up to my 3 closest friends about struggling with an eating disorder but I felt like they never understood or took it seriously. I have always felt a little invalidated when I’ve spoken about it around them because they are all on their own weight loss journey. I usually brushed it off and didn’t want to think about it too much but things got worse for a while lately. I had covid and lost quite a bit in a short time. The thoughts came flooding back where I was thinking about it all the time. I’m trying to be vague about all my thoughts, I’m sure you all understand how much it can be on your mind. I mentioned to them about how I struggled while I had covid and my two guys friends generally stayed quiet, my roommate and best friend would just say “I’m the opposite” or “I need that to happen to me” when I said one of my symptoms was a loss of appetite. I felt like my problems weren’t important enough. I tried last night opening up again about it because I feel so alone. I mentioned it and she seemed to just brush it off and just say a bunch of “mmm” and “mmhm”. I felt discouraged and decided not to bring it up again. Later in the night she had a snack she didn’t like and wanted me to try, when I tried it and put it back down because it was gross to me as well she said “not worth the calories.” I just kinda said “yeah..” I know it’s a hard thing to understand, especially if you feel that you are having the opposite problem, but I have always understood when any of them have talked about their journey with weight loss. I just feel like they don’t see it as an actual problem and don’t see how hard I am struggling. The few times I have reached out they’ve either stayed quiet or made comments like the ones above. In all other aspects they are the best friends I could ask for, I love them to death but I feel so alone. I know some people have said this before, it makes me feel like I was never “sick enough” not that I want to be but you know the feeling. My boyfriend is very supportive and understanding and patient with me but we are long distance and I would like to be able to talk with my friends about it and be taken seriously.

need a pro-recovery advice on this specific situation I am in,2,scoljs,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/scoljs/need_a_prorecovery_advice_on_this_specific/,7,"LIGHT TRIGGERWARNING/CONTENT WARNING for describing just the basics of my current eating behaviour, I will not go into a lot of detail (only mentioning what's relevant to the question)

>!I'll start ahead with saying I AM NOT DIAGNOSED with any eating disorders. However my behaviours can be considered similiar to ED-behaviours, that's why I hope y'all lovely people can help me out here.!<

>!I've been always somewhat bullied for my weight when I was younger, I used to be a bit overweight, chubby would probably describe it best. I developed a strong dislike for my body, and some time ago I moved into my own apartment, where I can freely decide what food goes in my fridge and no one is here to notice changes in my eating behaviours. So long story short, my current life situation (not working, not doing any activities that require having a lot of energy)  allowed me to not eat anything for 4 weeks. I had to start again because of dehydration as my body lacked the electrolytes to keep the fluid intake, so the following 4 weeks I only fed on bred with salt on it. And now for a good week I've been back on not eating anything, because I realized that I kinda started eating more and more bread each day (not super high amounts, just the amount of bread I ate rose daily, continously with no end in sight, which scared me a lot).!<

>!Currently, there are a few positive changes in my life situation happening and I found that I would be willing to eat at least a small amount of food daily (which would obviously be way better than literally nothing right now as it is currently), but I don't start with that because I fear the 'bread-situation' will happen again and I will start eating more and more each day up to an amount that would be way too unhealthy to consume daily.!<

>!So my question is if anyone could offer me some advice or some resources about this specific topic. How can I start eating again but maintain a daily amount of food intake that does not rise, like it was with the 'bread-situation' I had? If I can't work out how to do that I will probably continue with my strict no-food intake, that would be damaging and I do not want that.!<

Stomach issues 6 months into recovery making it impossible to eat enough,12,sba2l1,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sba2l1/stomach_issues_6_months_into_recovery_making_it/,12,"Hey all, 

I was in inpatient treatment from February-May 2021 for anorexia nervosa. I came out of treatment dedicated to recovery and spent the next 6 months doing what I needed to to ensure I'm feeding my body enough. 

Starting early November 2021, I began experiencing nausea that became chronic. It made it VERY difficult to eat. Many days I was back to eating the same amount of calories as before I went inpatient. I had to go to the hospital at the start of December and was weighed--I'd lost significant weight.

Mid-December 2021 the nausea went away (mostly), but I've been left with zero appetite since then. I am eating nowhere near enough to sustain my body. I recognize the lack of energy, depression, etc that I felt when I was in my ED. Not being able to eat has triggered some ED thoughts but I'm managing them well enough. 

I TRY to eat. As soon as I get hungry, I grab food. Even when I'm not hungry. I try because I learned a lot through ED treatment and don't want to regress. But I can only take a few bites before I physically can't eat anymore. I'm still eating close to the same amount of calories as pre-treatment, which is dangerously low. It's been nearly 3 months of this. I do not weigh myself, so I don't know how much weight I've lost, but I notice it on my body.

I'm scared to see a doctor. I worry they'll just tell me I'm ""being anorexic"" again because of my history. I've had stomach issues in the past that were never really resolved or taken seriously, and I worry my ED has contributed to whatever is going on. All the suggestions I see online are to exercise to stimulate appetite, but exercising is really ED triggering for me still. I've been downplaying this or  not talking about it at all to anyone because I don't want them to think I've relapsed into ED. I'm worried I HAVE relapsed into my ED and I'm just in denial and/or using stomach issues as an excuse. I do have a history of that.

But I've been having such a hard time, because my mom listens to these podcasts/talks (WITHOUT HEADPHONES - idk why she doesn't like them) about eating cleanly, losing weight, not eating ""xyz"" types of food and makes comments to me about people, like, ""oh, did so-and-so gain weight?"" or ""he looks heavier than he used to"" - the usual stuff.

She commented about how I should increase my rent because she's ""spending so much more than she used to on food"" - most likely not meant to be directed to my ED at all but my brain just FREAKED OUT when she said that.

I know it's wrong and I know I'm starting to take it to a dangerous extreme. But even so, I don't stop myself. Part of me wants to get sicker. Because I'm addicted to see that number go down.

At this point I don't even know if I have body dysphoria or if my weight loss just doesn't show at all. The number goes down, but I don't see any results. And that's what makes me keep going. Even though I'll never be satisfied.

When does it become dangerous for me? I feel like I'm still holding up quite well. I can't help but compare myself to others. I'm still restricting, but I eat the junkiest of foods imaginable. Maybe that's why I don't see any results. I'm just too much of a picky eater to even try to eat healthier.

Hiding food from partner,11,sae6jj,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sae6jj/hiding_food_from_partner/,3,"I hope this is the right place for this.
I’ve been struggling with disordered eating for years now and talked about it with my partner. They sometimes try motivating me to eat, but never force me to and are overall pretty supportive.
I’m currently stuck somewhere mid-recovery, I guess. Can’t get professional help due to personal reasons, but dk how to get better by myself.

I’m studying for my exams in february, so I pretty much only sit at my desk (bc university stuff is all online atm).

I will not go into detail about my eating behaviour in general, but it’s not enough.
I don’t think I’m actively restricting, but can’t eat because of nausea, sensory issues and the inability to cook for myself (it just needs too much energy, if anyone has advice for that, pls tell me).

Now let’s get to the actual topic of this post which I mentioned in the caption.
While studying I sometimes eat snacks. It’s a way for me to stay concentrated and get at least some food inside of me.

Rn there’s some food on my desk (pack of gummy bears and a half-eaten chocolate). I’m planning to sleep soon, but am being kept awake by overthinking. My partners is coming over tmrw and even though they might not even notice my desk, it’s scary. They want me to recover. But I feel ashamed bc of the food on my desk. I don’t even know why. It doesn’t make any sense to me. I just feel the need to hide it. I guess it’s partially because I want them to see I’m still struggling even though they know. That’s probably the attention-seeking part of this disorder.

I also feel extremely guilty for having eaten that stuff, because I keep comparing myself to other people with eating disorders and feel invalid.

I think I’m just hoping for a bit of reassurance and maybe some advice right now.

Recovering from a partner who encouraged your ed massive TW,6,sa3a2k,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/sa3a2k/recovering_from_a_partner_who_encouraged_your_ed/,4,"I've always had an eating disorder, I'll go through periods where it gets bad I lose 10-20 pounds and it gets better again and I eat normally. Basically I went through this yoyo cycle from about 9-15. I think I was happiest when I was 15, i ate normally was a normal weiglht and really truly was in love with my own body. I remember being able to really look at myself in the mirror and just be so utterly in love with every lump and curve and i felt ready to get myself out there and really give my all to someone.





Anyway that someone was a piece of shit. I fell head over heels for a cute Korean girl in my art class. I asked her out she said yes, and the first couple months of dating were probably the most confident I could have ever felt. I told her about my eating issues and trauma and it was like everything just went downhill from there. She said she also struggled with ana, and when she lived in korea was hospitalized and she gave numbers, and in graphic detail how her body looked. After this convo I relapsed. Which is my fault, she was just telling me about something in her life and i took it as triggering. She obviously figured out something was wrong because loosing 10-20 pounds at a normal weight quickly is noticeable and concerning. She was loving and supportive at first but then wanted to know what food I was eating, how many cals. Then I felt pressured to keep going lower and lower for her to make her proud of me. 




I passed out in the shower and that was my wakeup call. I started to recover, I started eating my fear foods, upping my cals etc. And she was supportive but not really. She also started eating her fear foods and would take 3 bites before saying ""oh it's not my fault my tiny tummy is full"" LITERALLY. She started sending me pictures of emaciated korean celebrities and trying to get me to eat korean food by saying ""oh it's such lower cal than all the american grease u eat haha"". She constantly talked about how she loved korean beauty standards, how dad bods on girls never did it for her but it did for me because she loved me. 






Eventually she introduced me to one of her friends who was visiting the US and this girl straight up looked like a model. She was so thin and beautiful and kind and I felt so guilty for being triggered by her existence. I met her boyfriend too and he was also just ridiculously beautiful and kind. I just felt so intimidated because they shared her culture and language, they're skinnier than me and prettier and what's holding her to me in the first place. I felt so eaten by my jealousy and the weight just kept coming off me. She started openly flirting with both of them in front of me, every time we would talk or go somewhere I felt so nauseous. Sometimes she would purposefully speak Korean to them in front of me to leave me out of the conversation until her friend put her foot down about it. ""We're in America and we will speak english especially in front of YOUR girlfriend because unlike you, we want to include her."" I still remember how pissed my ex looked after that.








All of us eventually broke up, I broke up with my gf because she eventually just started ignoring me for her celebrity crushes. Her friends broke things off with my ex because it was causing issues for them and couldn't stand her anymore. I haven't seen or heard from any of them in over a year and I just can't get over it. 



I still don't feel like I'm enough anymore and my eating disorder is the worst it's been in my life. I don't miss her or the abuse it's just the recovery that's kicking my ass and I feel stupid for it. Anytime i try to complain about it it's haha it's a stupid teenage girl hung up on her ex.

I sleep when everyone's awake and I'm awake when everyone's asleep. (Unless i got college or responsibilities ill just sleep all evening and stay up all night again) 
The main reason I try do this?
Of course to avoid any form of food or being forced to eat food (from my parents)
So far today I've only had a cup of coffee, it's almost 3pm. I can't fall asleep so i am just scrolling through social media or whatever 
Weighed myself when i woke up this morning. ____. Sure it's an improvement to how i used to be but no its not good enough. Too much. 
It's my motive to not eat. Because seeing the scale go down is satisfying. Since i stay awake all night I use that time to exercise until my body gives up. Then I usually play videogames or something then when i feel less tired I go again. More exercise. Parents cant see me. Its winwin. 
Yesterday i made it through all day with just sugar free gum and coffee but when i come home my mom forces me to eat food. I said i wasnt hungry and she gave me food anyway claiming its a small portion. It looked massive. Id say no more than (insert low amount) calories(not sure because idk what the dish exactly was ) it makes me feel so sad when i dont eat what my parents give me because im scared they will get mad at me or see me as ungrateful so i...eat it. As soon as i was done i ran off to my room to sleep . It felt like my stomach was attacking me, punishing me for eating for once i hated it. I managed to fall asleep and woke up but way too late to exercise since my parents were already awake. I have to wait for tonight now i weighed myself when i woke up. Still ___ i think to myself if this is how much i weight with no food i can only imagine how bad itll be if i actually did eat .

I would appreciate any comments that you may have on the following questions or any other insight you can provide.  I understand that some of these questions can be sensitive.  I am happy with whatever you are comfortable with answering.  Thank you very much!

Questions:

1. How long has your family member been struggling with anorexia nervosa, and at which age?
2. Are you aware of any resources/interventions your family member has used in the past or present to help them?  If so, what are they and how effective have they been from your perspective?
3. How involved are you in helping to support your family member with their illness?
4. How has this illness impacted your family member and your family in general?
5. How effective do you think digital solutions can be to help people struggling with anorexia nervosa?  Why?
6. Do you have any suggestions for what features would be most useful in a digital solution geared towards youths struggling with anorexia nervosa?  (Note that the term 'solution' here does not necessarily refer to treatment/recovery, but rather a general term for a product designed to help its users.)
7. Do you have anything else you would like to share?

I’m f(21) my partner is nb(20). We’ve been together for 2 years and living together during this time. When I met my partner I was in another relapse. I had confided in them about my anorexia and they took it upon themselves to make food for me constantly and sit with me through eating. I wasn’t ready to recover. They held me while I cried and hated the wonderful food they made me. Held me through lying about my intake. Still to this day they try to control what I eat after this. I can see why they’re reacting this way.
They left me to do ldr with them for an internship. I was so excited and proud of them!! I still am. But I was never ready to recover. My brain has been taking this time to “get hot”. They were scared to leave me because they were worried I’d relapse. I feel horrible but I can’t control it right now. My brain is convinced I need to “get hot” I compare my body to everyone around them and I convince myself that if I’m skinnier and they leave me they’ll regret leaving me. My partner and I have shared finances and a family together and logically I know they’re not leaving but I can’t shed it. I have to be better. Be skinnier.
When they left I got a scale. I fucked up pretty bad. I’ve dropped a lot of weights within the two weeks they’ve been gone. Talking to our couples therapist she said I need to understand this is their boundary for me. Sara cannot watch me do this again. I have ocd, bipolar, bpd, and anorexia. My mix of mental health problems had been really rough since my partner left. I slightly came clean to my partner about my ED thoughts to start the 12 steps and admit my problem knowing their boundary was I can’t keep doing this. Still I haven’t told my therapist or anyone I’ve been dropping weight. I see my partner this upcoming week and I feel guilty for my relapse. Last night I ate so much at a friends house resulting in some gain. I am struggling. I don’t know how to recover for me. I don’t want to. The competition in my head is so strong. My ed has made my ocd so much quieter. It’s been the most safe I’ve felt in my own head for a while.
Choosing my ED or my partner is giving me a significant amount of stress. I don’t know why I can’t stop. I’m so ashamed. I don’t know if I can recover right now. But the thought of losing my partner would kill me. I ate last night and the feeling is suffocating. The feelings are back. The sadness, fear, medical ocd, depression. I don’t understand why people can’t let me live. I deserve love even if I can’t recover right now. Does anyone else understand this turmoil? What helps? I can’t hurt my partner with this. I don’t want to. I’m an addict though.",1642603314.0

I obsessively check the mirror and squeeze my fat into the shape I desire it to be.

Feeling hungry makes me feel skinny and good about myself. I’m the happiest I will ever be when I’m starving.

I chew food and spit it out into the trash can to either hide it from my family or taste it without gaining weight.

This makes me a terrible person, but anyone skinny I walk past or see, the first thing I do is compare their body to mine in my head and feel bad that I’m not as beautiful as them. I envy them. I strive to be like them.

Work is the only place where I even pretend to eat.  it's hard to avoid eating entirely or make as many excuses to people who interact with you every single day - especially since they're all becoming very suspicious of my major weight loss. But at home, nobody can interfere or get suspicious or get worried. I live 20 minutes from the nearest town - I would be fully isolated, a perfect storm for me starving.

So I took a major leap and told one of my coworkers who I trust about what's going on and where I am at with my ED. I told her because I wanted someone to hold me accountable for how i acted at home and check in to make sure I am not just working out and not eating for weeks at a time. 

I just wish trying to recover didnt feel BAD. I feel embarrassed, and I'm mad at myself for outing myself to a coworker. I'm angry that I can't lie anymore without someone calling me out, and I'm scared she will tell the others, and everyone will interfere with my starving.  It's overwhelming and defeating.

I’ve been eating right (enough) and lifting weights, following an actual workout program. 

The problem is is that it isn’t working. At first it was going good, the muscles I wanted to grow were growing and the places that I wanted to shrink were shrinking.

I relapsed not long ago. But I'll always remember when I was in high school. Couldn't keep anything. A friend who was also struggling and went to in-patient a lot once convinced me to go and tell the nurse of our school like she had done the first time.
I agreed. I was nervous and nervously smiling and giggling (i tend to do that when in these kind of situations). The nurse asked me questions and weighed me. I was underweight, but barely, so it was it. I never got help.

Then at 16, after being recovered for a little while, I relapsed. I had came out as trans to my mother and was sent to see a sexologue/psy who really worsened my mental health. My mother heard me purge and confronted me. It did make me stop purging. I told the sexologue/psy about my relapse and... She shrugged it off.

Over the years, I got so many ""you're skinny, but I know someone skinnier than you!"" That I convinced myself I invented it. That I didn't really struggle with EDs. It was reinforced by never getting hospitalised or getting help.

Then I did what I had to do to transition in 2019-2020. I was seing a nurse and she was so sweet and kind and when I told her about it, she called me brave and congratulated me for overcoming it. It was the first time I felt heard. Then I started seing a social worker who also took seriously my mental health issues.

Now I don't see anyone and have relapsed (gained weight during the pandemic and was starting to feel really bad about it and then I forgot to eat a lot during a week because of stress nd work and lost much weight and... I felt great so yeah..)

i've gotten worse over the last couple months but my family doesn't know i don't eat right, i always lie to them. i don't know what to do. around a week ago on a friday i got really dizzy and almost passed out at school from a migraine and when i got home my mom said it was dehydration and made me drink lots of fluids over the weekend but i've felt guilty because it may have been malnutrition or something and she doesn't know that. i have to go to the doctors for my yearly checkup in a few weeks and i know the scale will confirm i haven't lost any weight since last year and i'm going to continue to get worse. i'm currently at a healthy weight but on the thin side. i'm scared im going to not eat and fast for a long time again and get sick from that and the headaches from my low whatever are so painful and annoying but i can't tell anyone i know that i don't eat right because i'm scared i'm only going to get yelled at. i dont know what to do",1642302142.0
Relapsing in ED while GI issues,10,s4sdnj,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/s4sdnj/relapsing_in_ed_while_gi_issues/,7,"Hi all. I need input please!
After having AN (6 years) and ARFID (1 year) I developed a condition called Gastroparesis (a paralyzed stomach).  Other GI disorders I have are GERD, Gastritis, and Enteritis. 
I was put on a NJ tube (goes into your intestines past your stomach) after those diagnoses that went straight into my intestines two years ago in order to keep my weight up. But before I had any GI diagnoses I was just on an NG tube (goes into your stomach). 
I bring the feeding tube topic up because I’m at my goal rate (X amount of calories an hour) and I’ve started gaining weight instead of staying pretty much the same weight. 
I didn’t like that and I noticed myself eating nothing by mouth anymore and just doing the tube feeds. I’ve lost 17.32% of my body weight (I am not sharing my SW or CW) in the last 3 weeks. 
When I want help, I’m denied it. But when I don’t want help I end up getting it. Like I wish my care team would make up their damn minds.",1642275743.0

I’ve also started weighing myself obsessively again and getting distressed when I feel as though I haven’t lost enough.

I’m scared. My ED took such a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend I don’t want to fuck up our relationship again. Should I tell him it’s getting bad again? Should I wait to see if it gets worse before I tell him? Or should I just hide it completely and hope he won’t notice?

honestly have I just relapsed or am I just really freaking close to it.

It convinces you that even fantasizing about food makes you greedy and pathetic. It says things like, ""You can't even go one second without thinking about food, you fatty.""

Even if you follow its rules perfectly, you will never be sick enough in its eyes. You lose the weight it wanted gone, but now it wants you to lose more. If it's happy about your weight for even a second, it finds new problems: you're too bloated, too much fat on your stomach, don't purge enough, don't eat the right foods, not enough cold showers, not enough laxatives.

My mum would absolutely NEVER do that in real life, but these dreams feel so real, and they're so horrible and vivid that they really stick with me.
It's driving me absolutely INSANE- I used to be able to sleep to escape my problems, but now I only wake up feeling worse than I did prior to sleeping- I've woken up in tears on multiple occasions because they feel so real, and it takes me back to a point in time that I was at my very lowest. Whilst things haven't necessarily improved on my end- I'm not fighting with my family like I was, they think I'm recovering (I'm currently relapsing horribly, but I can't go back to the arguing and the meltdowns; it's easier to fake my way around everything.)

idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best",1641953728.0

I fucking hate how much this disease has taken away from me. It’s gotten to the point where I can barely hold a pencil and write down my notes for class.

I’m terrified, but at the same time, this is a wake up call for me. I finally got a call back from the ed hotline and have the resources to attempt recovery. I’m scared that my dad will make harsh comments as I slowly gain weight, since he told me “I’m going to be so fucking pissed off at you if you become fat” which has scared me, but I need to push through his harsh comments. He’s called me a “fat pig” when I tried to have my halo top ice cream, which I haven’t had in 5 months since his harsh words repeat in my head.

Do you think (although its different for evryone ofc)
that ur ed could be simplified into one thing (mainly
restrictive im talking about with this example)? 

like i think i just tried too kinda sum up why i restrict
into a sentence and i wonder if that at its core that is what a restrictive ed is. (for me at least.) - I dont mean this sums it up for everyone. 
 
for instance i kinda knew the answer but i wanted too see what google results came up with when i typed in
""whats it called when you dont want too eat because
youll feel too much"" and ofc AN came up as a top result.

and ik that eds are complex mental illnesses but when we invalidate ourselves over little things i feel like this gives me perspective because sometimes i feel like having an ed can come down too a 'simple?' thing. like not wanting too eat because you wont be able too numb ur emotions. idk if this is making sense. using that example like what other reason could that result in besides from an ed. thats surely not a normal thinking pattern or that of a dieter. is this making sense?

Are normal diets possible post AN?,4,s10mho,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/s10mho/are_normal_diets_possible_post_an/,8,"Hi guys! Im in recovery, have been in/ out for over a year now. Im at a point where im a healthy weight but im unhappy with my body, in more of a typical human struggle way than frantic anorexic self hatred way. Losing weight so unhealthily destroyed all my muscle mass and i just feel bleh. I want to diet, lose a few pounds and bulk up my muscles, but i don’t know if its feasible.

My question is more of a discussion point i guess- are recovering/ recovered anorexics possible of going on a semi restrictive diet without triggering relapse? 

Ive tried to diet before but have been stuck in that toxic “black/white” mentality and relapsed. If anyone has any advice or experiences id love to hear!",1641864686.0

I’ve been in slightly better spirits in light of leaving my old job (which was a huge trigger/source of stress for me). Today was awesome, had orientation for work in another city which was nice.

So we’re talking about me starting a WFH position as opposed to my last job which was not. And then she goes “now you’re really going to that gain weight”. But she says it in a negative way, but casually/jokingly the way non-ED brain people do. 

I just don’t understand why she had to say that. Especially when all of our recent conversations have been about me getting healthy again and gaining some weight back.

When the number is lower than the day before I know I at least have that going for me. 

Maybe one day I could be at a point where I'm actually happy with my body. It's seems impossible, but restriction has made me feel like I'm at least not contributing to the problem by eating more. 

The more I restrict the faster I get there and the less likely there is for me to eat too much. In the past I've been more of a binger so being on the restriction side of things almost balances me out. 

Maybe if I could remove the hate out the the equation and just eat less to be thinner it would be better. I think the self loathing is built into it though. It's the motivation. 

When I'm thinner I'll love myself. I will have finally fixed what's held me back all my life.

My eating disorder comes and goes when it comes to what I actually consume. All in all I’ve been really strong and controlled it so that I don’t lose a lot more, but I am still losing weight.

I avoid the scale but one morning I couldn’t hold the temptation. I had not gained weight, it was all in my head.

I also struggle with appetite even when in my so called recovery. I can’t stand eating sometimes, I forget to eat for a concerningly long amount of time and it triggers me.

boyfriend in denial - how to help,4,s0641x,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/s0641x/boyfriend_in_denial_how_to_help/,1,"Trigger warnings - description of illness & eating habits

Hi, so I have plenty of my own issues around food and have been severely underweight and nearly died. So I do have experience with restrictive eating and massive weight loss. I can relate some, but not completely. 

My boyfriend had a significant trauma when he was 18. Ever since then he has had issues with restrictive eating. To me from the outside looking in it looks like anorexia, but I can't diagnose him. 

What I can say is that most times when I ask him when was the last time he ate it was at least a day ago and if he does eat it is normally only 1 very small meal. He has made several comments about how it can't be anorexia. One being that when he thinks of anorexic people he thinks of people like Eugenia Cooney and models - and basically that he doesn't believe he is sick enough. I told him that there are plenty of overweight anorexics but he found this very hard to believe. He says that he forgets to eat, that he gets busy, that he smokes too much, that he only eats if he is hungry - which is never. He also seems to have a hard time with admitting it may be an eating disorder because he is a man.

It doesn't seem to be about calories or even really about weight. He did say that he is disgusted by fat and if he ever got fat he would just stop eating. When he does eat a lot of times he will eat sweet food or he will have Burger King. Another reason he doesn't think he is anorexic - because anorexics wouldn't eat that. When he eats it is never anything decent and it mainly seems like he gets to the point of starvation where he needs to eat and just gives in. He regularly eats just some cheese for dinner and that is it. He is underweight, he is always freezing and for the past few years he has had a hard time thinking straight. He does seem to have a significant issue with control and will fully admit that. For Christmas I brought over a few cookies - because I know he is a sucker for sweets and really struggles to eat anything around the holidays. I watched him break a cookie in half, eat a quarter of it and then put the rest back. 

His issue with eating also seems to be a giant cry for help. I am the only one who has ever pointed it out all the years he has struggled with it. And he does better when I check in on him and ask him if he's eaten today- it seems to remind him to take care of himself. In times of stress he gets really down and doesn't eat and loses weight. It seems that anytime things are out of control he just stops eating. 

I don't know how to help him than to continue to check in on him. I don't know how to get him to admit to himself- let alone me- that he may have an eating disorder. He does seem to be okay talking about it all even if he is in denial and makes excuses for his restrictive eating. He can't really just go get help if he doesn't think there is a problem..

So basically my questions are...
How can I help him?
What did people say to you or did you do that helped you eat more frequently?
How can I be supportive yet also helpful?
Also does anyone know where to find any facts about overweight people who have anorexia? He seemed to think this was a myth.
How did you come out of denial?",1641774564.0

“In recovery” and simultaneously getting worse…,5,rzipcf,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rzipcf/in_recovery_and_simultaneously_getting_worse/,3,"
The last few weeks I’ve been working with a dietitian and coach to help me “reverse diet” . I have severe metabolic adaptation / damage. The only reason I am working with the dietitian and coach is because I want my metabolism to work again so I can lose weight. I’m not so much trying to recover because at this point I dont think recovery is fully possible. Lately I’ve been very triggered. They said they would do the reverse diet VERY slowly. They put my macros at a level that they thought was slow but in reality, my carbs and protein was upped SO much that my body basically blew up like a ballon, from the carbs mainly. I told them that I’ve been wanting to relapse and purge so they said they would lower the carbs etc. i have no problem eating protein, but carbs just don’t work well with me. I eat a low amount of carbs that would be labeled as keto or low carb. 

I got my food sensitivities results  back and it has triggered me even deeper into my eating disorder. When I go to the grocery store I leave with cucumbers, avocados, mustard , canned, pumpkin carrots and vegan protein powder and coconut milk . I am full blown orthorexic at this point . Even though I eat like an anorexic person, I am still a normal weight and “look healthy”. Part of me wishes my body could get down to an underweight number again like I did 10+ years ago. But since I now have hypothyroidism and hashimotos, it’s pretty much impossible to lose weight even when I eat less than 1,000 calories. This is the reason why I’m working with the dietitian. I just want my metabolism to work so I can reach my weight loss goals. ((Which I told her)). She said my metabolic damage is very bad and the only way out of this mess is reverse dieting. I’m trying, I really am. But I’m completely turned off. The food sensitivities test told me I can’t eat a long list of foods, 4 of which I was eating everyday and they were my only safe foods. I feel lost, hopeless, depressed, miserable. I feel like I can’t eat anything. Literally every vegan product has garlic in it. I can’t have garlic. Along with a lot of other foods. 

My life has become one big obsession with fixing my metabolism, losing weight, while simultaneously “recovering” , going to Ed meetings, therapy 2-3x a week. My life has become nothing but ocd. When does my life start? Why don’t I just accept the fact that I have an Ed and just say fuck it. I have an Ed for the rest of my life. Oh well. 

So yeah, I’m “in recovery” yet simultaneously getting worse. The way I’m eating is fucking stupid but I guess since I look normal, no one cares. I wish my body would let go of all the weight. Wish I could snap my fingers and lose 20 lbs.",1641700460.0

I can’t stop thinking about these comments. I was always the fat/chubby girl and now *I’m the skinny girl*. It makes me want to get even thinner or post more photos like that in hopes to be “skinny shamed” again. This is making me feel really guilty, and I’m afraid I’ll down slide again.

My younger sister needs help.,23,rz33y7,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rz33y7/my_younger_sister_needs_help/,15,"Hello everyone in this subreddit, I appreciate you taking time out of your day to read this. 
I'm 19 years old and I have a 15 year old younger sister who is currently dealing with anorexia nervosa. Long story short: my sister has a pretty good relationship with myself and our mom and often confides in our mom regarding her ED as she does not really talk to me about it at all. She's been going to a ballet school for the past 2 years and is now starting her third year there. She's an incredible dancer and really loves it. 

I'm posting this question: what can I do to help her or comfort her in any way? My mom usually helps her and supports her but not being able to do anything or help her is really destroying me. I go to meetings for drug abuse and I've asked some other addicts there for help and they've recommended ""EDA"" (eating disorders anonymous) and many of them have told me I should try get her to one of those meetings as some of them go to those as well and tell me it really helps. This was comforting to find but my sister doesn't want to attend them online and I can't, and don't want to force her to do anything she's not comfortable with.

Other than that I use words of comfort and encouragement and tell her I'm there for her no matter what, and that I really will love her until she learns to love herself but I really don't know what to do anymore... She's seeing a dietician and was going to therapy regularly last year. 

I just want to help her in any way I can. Thank you for reading this and if you have any advice I will read it and do the best I can.",1641657848.0

I hate this so much,10,rz7nyt,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rz7nyt/i_hate_this_so_much/,5,"I've only recently discovered that I might have Anorexia Nervosa. It's a self diagnosis, but I feel like recognizing what's wrong with me is the first step in the right direction. Or at least that's what I thought.

I've become so self destructive. My ED seems to get worse day by day. And I don't think I can stop it.
I have a friend I can share some things with. But if I vented to her every time my ED acts up, she'd have to listen to my whining all day long.

What sucks most is that I have no self control even though I'm completely aware of what I'm doing.
I know that eating will make me feel guilty and horrible, but I do it anyways. I do like eating tasty things. But I only like it while eating.

I wish I could stop myself, but I eat so fast that I don't even have a chance to stop.

Sometimes I'll think rational and tell myself ""it's okay, you already cut down on calories so much, this won't even do much"" but then I'll feel guilty anyways.

I wonder how different it would be if I lived alone. If I cooked for myself, would I cook healthily and eat 3 meals a day? Or would I eat as little as possible and then resort to binging the junkiest of junk foods?

It seems like my mom still hasn't noticed anything. Though everyone around me makes comments about how I've lost weight, it doesn't seem to concern them. And this is just another trigger for me.

They say I lost weight, but I haven't lost enough. They say I look slim, but I don't look slim enough in the mirror. 

I'm starting to scare myself. I thought I had control over myself, but I'm starting to lose it. My weight goal keeps getting smaller everytime I'm even remotely close to reaching it. I don't think I'll ever be satisfied.

When I talked to my friend about it for the first time, she asked me how thin I wanted to be. I don't know. I just want to be happy. But everytime I see myself, weigh myself, eat or hear anything about weight or eating, I feel horrible.",1641669847.0

Also tried to keep it as trigger-free as I could while still describing the situation but same goes, and sorry in advance if I had trouble staying on topic it's kind of a theme with me.

I (21F) have struggled on and off with eating disorders for a really long time and recently relapsed pretty badly. I'm seeing someone who doesn't know my history and we'll often go out to get food together, we've seen each other for about six months and this is something we were doing pre-relapse but it's obviously now feeling more complicated. In particular, I've been feeling super wasteful since the relapse started whenever we go out. We went to get breakfast today and I ended up eating the whole meal purely because I felt so bad at how much of the food he's been getting I've been wasting. Now I'm caught in a loop because a.) my ED now feels invalid because I finished a singular meal and b.) I'm so scared that whenever I work up the courage to tell him my history he won't believe me or something because he's one of the people I make an effort to appear more ""healthy"" about food around (which I know is irrational, he's amazing and wouldn't do me dirty like that but the thought's still there). I've always had a weird complex about my ED being ""valid"" and I'm now really upset and torn about how to feel. Has anyone else experienced this feeling? One meal doesn't suddenly erase years of issues and it feels like I'm operating on some kind of wack extreme by thinking this. Any shared experience or advice about this feeling (and also how to approach discussing it with the guy I'm seeing without opening what feels like a massive can of worms) is very, very (like I'm talking VERY) much appreciated.

But there was a random mention of their weight today, and I got so triggered because it was very near my goal weight back when I first struggled with anorexia. It was the weight I had achieved at my thinnest, too (actually even a couple lbs less).

Being weight restored and relapsing, hearing their weight (which I will not mention for obvious reasons) crushed me. It made me jealous, I want it back so badly.

I've always struggled with body image. Growing up my mom would negatively comment on our bodies and her own. Throughout high school and my early 20s I've had on and off bad relationships with food. Random diets,  restricting sometimes binging. I'm in my late 20s now. For the last year or 2 I'm realizing how much worse I've gotten.  It started again with a fad diet to only lose a little,  but then it spiraled. ""Only a little more"" I'd tell myself. These days I hardly eat at all. Some days I skip food all together, others I only have a snack or two. I don't feel good. Lately I've thrown up (not purposely) after eating only a small snack. I'm constipated constantly and experience blood. I haven't had my period in months,  which I assumed was a new birth control but I'm thinking it's my eating habits. I'm tired,  can't get good sleep.  I'm so cold that my feet hurt. My chest hurts, I feel like my heart ""stops"" sometimes or that I'll stop breathing. My skin is red and splotchy. I've started counting drinks like tea or coffee as calorie intake. I've told my husband I've eaten when I haven't sometimes or say I ate something extra I didn't. I've been more irritable and prone to emotional blow ups. I don't have the energy to do much of anything. I need to change. I am still in denial a bit about there being a problem even though the symptoms I'm experiencing line up and I know I'm not eating right. I know if I don't do something soon it'll get worse. I really want to talk to my husband about this,  but I don't know how to start. How can I bring this up to get some help? Thank you.  I've been reading posts on here for a while now but just got the courage to post.

Edited to add: Is this something I can fix on my own and how do I go about getting my food intake back up? Thank you again for taking the time to read.",1641527760.0

What triggered your ED?,15,rxfq9g,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rxfq9g/what_triggered_your_ed/,32,"For me(22f) it was a whole bunch of stuff, but the number one reason if I have to guess is simply being born a female and the constant pressure to look/ act a certain way that comes with it. As well as stuff like my family's absolute shitshow that is our genetics(and guess who got the worst of both sides both mentally and physically? this bitch!), and with my dad coming from a family where a vast majority are farmers, I was always told to clean my plate even though it was way too much food for a kid. I also learned just last year that my grandmother was anorexic before she gave birth to my mom*(kind of important bit of family history there considering that my parents now at least partially acknowledge that I am mentally ill)*

We were only allowed a small amount of sweets on saturdays, and that only lead me to sneaking them and binging in secret when I became a teenager.

Food was used as a reward, and withheld as a punishment(never the meals, but everything unhealthy like the sweets)

My mom unconsciously projected her own insecurities onto me from a very early age. I spiraled into depression and self hatred in my teens due to a whole bunch of shit that went down, and was never allowed the time to properly recover nor did I ever receive help for my mental health despite asking for it.

Got a little better a few years later and then my mental health spiraled again bc I never received proper help the first time. Still wasn't taken seriously and I got scarily close at making an attempt to commit a 17-year late self-abortion.

Eventually all of this stuff(and a whole bunch of shit I've not mentioned) just formed into this messed up image of myself. Fat, worthless, ugly, untalented, stupid etc...

And then, the year I graduated (grade 12 is when you graduate here and then move on to higher education like university), I decided that I wanted to lose weight because I was fat and miserable, and so that maybe, *just maybe*, I could fit into some nice clothes for graduation day.

What went wrong however, was the fact that my dumbass brain decided that instead of getting my shit together and making a change towards being healthier in general, I had the brilliant idea that I just *don't eat.* No food, no calories, no weight gain. Right? Y'all can guess what happened next or you probably wouldn't be on this sub 🤡

&#x200B;

^(Sorry for dumping my life story on here but it's been rough lately and I had a shower thought moment  and then couldn't stop thinking about all the crap that led me down this pit.)

^(I'm hoping this insight might at least be beneficial for when I'm ready to recover.)

Gastritis + spastic esophagus,6,rwtjxl,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rwtjxl/gastritis_spastic_esophagus/,4,"Hey all! So I’ve been struggling with a relapse in my restriction for just over a year now. I have quite a few chronic illnesses, many of which have been exacerbated by my relapse. 

I have had ulcerative colitis for many years now, so get colonoscopies around once a year. I just finished my 10th one, and we also did my first upper endoscopy because I am having some new unusual symptoms, including worsening nausea and vomiting (always been nauseous but recently got way worse), and trouble swallowing especially pills (I take like 40 a day so this is def not great). I have Ehlers danlos syndrome so I thought maybe I was developing gastroparesis, which is common for both EDS and eating disorders, or perhaps my esophagus had lost collagen / structure or was damaged nerve-wise, also common with EDS. 

Turns out I sort of had the opposite problem? Rather than my esophagus -not- being able to contract, it’s contracting way too much. 

The scope also found I have a minor hernia in my stomach, and gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach (so it looks really raw and almost blistered, much like my colon does during a UC flare). 

Most of these issues can be caused by reflux, or purging/vomiting, neither of which are things I deal with. I mean I deal with vomiting (involuntary), but certainly not enough to seem to be able to cause issues such as these. 

So i guess I am just wondering if anyone has any insight? Does anyone else with purely restrictive disorders deal with this? Does anyone know why this may have happened since the usual suspects don’t add up?",1641407397.0

Seeking advice: how to approach a friend with ED?,1,rx3a28,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rx3a28/seeking_advice_how_to_approach_a_friend_with_ed/,3,"Hi community, 

TL;DR - My best friend has been dating his gf for almost 3 years now. 2 years ago I started noticing her eating behaviors. 1 year ago, I started confirming (internally) that she may have anorexia. Today, its very apparent and I don't know how to approach my best friend re: his gf with possible anorexia. Would love some advice from the community. 

My best friend just started residency, he just finished medical school. I have never talked to him about his gf and her possible ED because its a sensitive subject and I don't want to make anyone upset, or worse, potentially lose a friend, or cause them to have relationship issues that could lead to a breakup. 

I have a feeling that my best friend is aware of his gf's ED but I cannot be absolutely sure. I also cannot confirm that he has confronted his gf re: her ED. I do not know if they talk about it or have plans to work on it together as a couple. I suspect that they haven't because it doesn't seem to have gotten better in the 3 years I've known his gf. 

If I air on the side of giving him the benefit of the doubt and he is not aware of his gf's ED, then the first that comes to mind would be, possibly making him aware of it and having an open discussion of the situation. But I don't know, sometimes I feel like its not my place to say anything but then again, its very apparent that something is going on with his gf and if they are both in my life long-term, and even more substantially, if they continue to be a couple for many more years to come, this situation should be discussed shouldn't it? Im just not sure, and I feel scared to bring it up. 

I dont think I would want to confront his gf directly re: her ED. If anything, I would be open to bringing it up with my best friend first just to see how he feels about it. But I really don't know how to go about it. 

How do I know if she has an ED, you may ask? I've noticed these patterns so far: 

&#x200B;

* Limited food in-take daily: it is noticeable that she counts what she eats. Often times, she chooses to eat very minimal portions of her meal and then will choose to eat sugary snacks in replacement. For example, toffee bits for breakfast rather than a boiled egg. A full bottle of diet coke after every work out session, and 1/4 of a normal dinner meal. Or, ordering edamame for dinner as the only food after a 3 hour hike.  
 
* Obsessive behaviour over working out: she has never skipped a day of working out in 2021, even when she was sick with COVID. For her work outs she does: hot yoga. When there are days where she might not have time to do hot yoga, she does show signs of anxiety and disappointment. Even when we are on a group vacation, no matter where she is, she must do hot yoga. She used to turn hotel bathrooms into a hot yoga room just to work out in. Some days, when we do a 4 mile, moderately challenging hike, she will still do hot yoga afterwards. I understand that working out hard isnt necessarily a problem, but when it comes to replenishing and refueling with good food, this is not something she chooses to do.   
 

It might also help to get more context: she used to be a ballerina and now shes a professional yogi. 

I've communicated my concerns with my partner and he too agreed that hes noticed all these things. Additionally, my other really good friends started noticing it recently. 

Im seeking any professional or personal opinion/advice on this situation. I really do care about my friends and their relationship and of course, I care that shes taking care of herself. I suspect something bigger is happening underneath the surface: anxiety, lack of control, self hatred, pressure, etc and I wouldnt want this to prolong for anyone, especially if theyre going through it alone.

Criterias/reasons for your hospitalization,9,rwee9g,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rwee9g/criteriasreasons_for_your_hospitalization/,10,"Hi everyone. So the title is pretty much self-explanatory. I was wondering what was the criterias or reasons you were hospitalized (in a normal hospital on the psych floor or in ed treatment).

There are no specialized services for ED where I live. But I also have mental health problems. Right now, my anxiety is over the roof, my skin picking is very frequent, I use more drugs (weed), and I restrict HARD. I really have a hard time eating anything at all. I drink coffee during the day, have a few protein snacks before bed. I think about food, weight and calories all the time. 

I think I might want to be inpatient on the psych floor, but I was wondering if it was ENOUGH. Do you think my reasons are enough? I’m not yet underweight by the way, but I will probably be in around 10 days. 
If not, what do you think it would take?

I’m going to see my psych nurse on Monday, psychiatrist on Tuesday. What should I tell them? I’m afraid to ask for help as I’m afraid I will be turned down. 

Any advice?",1641357939.0

I'm 5'7 and am in the severe section of BMI. I didn't really like my belly, it looled bloated and I wanted it to change. I used to eat a lot. My grandma would say ""that's a lot"" or ""I thought that was for your mom, tou must have a big appetite."" My family would even ask if I was going to share since I got so much. I didn't think It was alot of a food, I didn't even finish it most times, I just got what I was craving which was normally a bit of everything. It made me feel embarrassed and over the years, more people would comment about my weight. Keep in mind people would regularly tell me how skinny I was because my arms are, and have always been freakishly thin. My legs too. 

My step father called me I needed to loose weight in front of my mom and she didn't even blink. I was 12 or 13 and around thr weight I am now, which is average for that age group. Even my mom at one point said I had a belly...and my great grandma, though she says everyone's fat it still made me feel bad. I started not liking my stomach, my thighs, my breasts... My body feels so weak that it's hard to get up in the morning, hard to exercise, it's hard to even open a door with my arms.

I started restricting my diet. I didn't eat much and when I did it made me feel physically nauseous. It was a large quantity for me I guess. I resist the urge to vomit. I normally eat kraft macaroni and cheese and that gets me full before I'm even finished. I just don't eat as much as I used to. In fact, I think I've gone a day with only eating 1 meal multiple times. There have been moments where my stomach or body are hungry, but the urge to eat isn't there...so I ignore it. Then my stomach starts to get upset, but the pain almoat feels...good. Like I'm helping my body by not eating.

Now, when I look in the mirror, I'm starting to like what I see. My stomach has less buldge. The sides of my hips look more shranken, and my breasts have grown slower then average. I prefer sports bras to squish them down. I actually considered binders in the future. It hit me when my mom seemed to freak out about me eating, and I, over the few years of this mood, never thought I had an issue. The doctor even said I was very underweight just by looking at me.

"I’m trying to recover, but my health condition seems to want the opposite :(",12,rus4dg,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rus4dg/im_trying_to_recover_but_my_health_condition/,2,"For context, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 13. It is an autoimmune disease where the immune system kills pancreatic cells, and management of the condition requires a great deal of carb counting and paying attention to nutrition info. I think it may have contributed to my ED, both due to the misunderstanding around it (some people would think I have type 2 and would suggest I go on a diet, which I’ve never actually needed) and the heavy emphasis on measuring and thinking about food. I’m having to manually perform an automatic bodily function by myself, after all.

So now I’m in that stage where I’ve gotten a better mindset about food and actually want to eat it. I still have some weight to gain before I reach my set goal, but it’s a slow process— it gets difficult to eat enough when I have to really worry about how it affects my blood sugar. I technically don’t have to restrict carbs, but it does get quite hard to eat more of them since insulin dosing isn’t near as perfect as it is when the body does it. If I eat a lot of carbs, I risk taking too little insulin and suffering high blood sugars, or I risk taking too much and passing out or something really bad. It’s just a tricky thing to have to think about. 

I do have a nutritionist who knows about t1d and who tries to create reasonable meal plans for me. Some of the ideas are very good, but others— especially the breakfasts— are more carbs than I think I could handle in one meal. I also have researched sample meal plans online out of curiosity and I was disappointed to notice that they all consist of heavy amounts of carbs. 100g of pasta, bread, rice, etc. when I’m still only able to have about a half cup of rice. Most recovery pages also stress that carb consumption is extremely important, and that you need carbohydrates to heal. How can I recover without something so important? I feel ashamed for still having to restrict.

Then there’s the topic of “food freedom”. If I’m truly recovered, I should allow myself to eat a donut spontaneously or to add honey to bread or to drink a milkshake or eat cookies at 11:00 PM. I see fellow people in recovery enjoying this new freedom, and of course I’m happy to see people gaining their happiness and energy back. But I can’t do the same myself, and it makes me feel like relapsing and going back to my ED is the better option for managing my health. I know I can’t do that. But recovery and t1d just don’t go together and I’m struggling because of it. Do I still deserve to recover? Is it even worth it if I still have to restrict a food group? 

Tl;dr: I have type 1 diabetes, and eating more carbs is hard because of it. I want to recover but know I’ll still have to restrict certain foods and read nutrition labels. What can I do to keep going?",1641181649.0

So I’ve gotta tell my parents because they’re the only ones who can get me treatment atm. I’ve approached them about anxiety before but never something like an ED.

I'm in the middle of holiday break from school and over the first week I have been looking at recovery content on youtube and during that first week I was disgusted at the idea of it but i still looked at it out of curiosity／mild triggers. i was miserable during that first week so I started body checking more frequently to make sure I was still thin. I noticed my face and stomach looked puffy and more bloated but I weighed less last time I weighed myself and I ate what I usually ate. my body dysmorphia got worse and people suddenly started commenting on my weight loss. It validated my eating disorder and it made me continue to restrict because I felt in control again but it also pissed me off because I felt ignored for so long but now you suddenly want to comment on how sick I am and how I should eat more. After a few days I started looking more into recovery content and I thought I would give it a chance because I wanted to try to become happier again. I decided to up my calories a little higher from what I was eating and I thought I was doing pretty well. during the meal I would plan if (I did omad) I would crave something I would eat it but I had to make sure it fit into my maintenance calories for my current weight so I could maintain, I didn't want to recover too quickly because I wouldn't be ready for it. If I did eat my craving it had to be after my meal because I needed to make sure the calories fit into my meal. The cravings didn't happen often and I hesitated to eat them because I knew it would prevent weight loss. Tuesday came and I finished my meal and afterward I had a craving for candy, I usually plan to eat at maintenance with candy on saturdays but I would then I would go back to heavy restriction the next day and so on, I made sure they were within my calorie limit and I ate them. Afterward I had a craving for another and I started to get anxious because it went over my maintenance but I ate it and then it spiraled into a heavy binge. I was out of control but strangely I was in euphoria because I was ""finally eating all the foods I wanted and I was free."" At least that's what I was thinking at the time. Halfway through the binge I felt like death but i kept eating, my stomach felt like tearing and I wanted to die. Fast forward a few hours and I was sobbing on my bed while looking through things that made me happy and listening to music that I used to enjoy but grew out of because of the eating disorder. My brain told me that it wasn't worth it to be sick and I wanted to recover. It was weird thinking that because there was no hesitance and it felt genuine. I didn't sleep that night and when morning arrived i continued to stuff my face and eat all my cravings. a few days after that i'm here now and i'm confused if i'm developing binge eating disorder because I feel like i'm ""more conscious"" of my binges but i'm just eating a lot of unhealthy cravings and junk. The shame is coming back and I feel like relapsing so I can be in control and be thin again. I'm scared of gaining too much weight too quickly. I'm very confused and I feeling like im not ""recovering the right way"" or i'm not eating healthy enough in recovery. I don't know if I should keep this up or not. I noticed I started to gain a bunch of weight around my face and stomach and I feel like an ugly fat blob, I heard about this being a thing in recovery but I feel worthless and I want to know when the weight starts to distribute so I don't have to be so insecure. I have to go back to school and I'm scared what people are going to think if they start seeing me eat again and gain weight.

continue this i was accepting how i currently behaved

christmas was crap lol got abit worse & urge too restrict was massive. ive not been alone at all for about a week now & staying at my friends and i feel so overwhelmed. staying at my friends has allowed me too restrict alot for the first time in 3 weeks or a month maybe and i feel like its just chucked me back into the deep end. i ate some toast this morning and havent felt that uncomfortable about eating food in ages. like 2 weeks ago that probs would have been ok but now its too stressful and since im not home and cant weigh food etc im using more behaviours too compensate. 

halve way thru eating i realised there was some mould on the bread, and my first thought was at least this could get me sick and i could loose weight. mate what. its crazy how easy these thoughts can slip back in after even accidentally restricting or when you don't even realise you've been slipping back. not sure where i stand with my ed at all anymore or if i have one rn. i guess it never rly goes away, i just want help so i can feel validated but dont actually want too get better :(

Maybe it’s a mental block, but I’m having a really tough time with getting up there. I recently discovered Ensure shakes, which can give me a good amount of calories and nutrition without having to physically eat, but it’s still not enough.

What are some of your favorite high calorie foods that still feel pretty safe? Preferably something that’s easy on the stomach because I deal with severe emetophobia.",1640906190.0

"I know recovery isn’t linear, but I’m pretty sure this is my all time low",12,rs6azj,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rs6azj/i_know_recovery_isnt_linear_but_im_pretty_sure/,1,"I’ve been talking about how badly I wanted to recover for 2 years now, and that’s clearly not true because here I am. I went to stay with my friends after one >!had to rip my gun out of my hand!< to stop me from unaliving myself. Everything happened really quickly after, like everything in my life changed over night. They have all sorts of things I’ve wanted and wouldn’t let myself buy, as well as tons of deserts from the holiday. At first I was really cautious about it, then it felt like I’d been given a golden ticket to eat whatever I want. That feeling crashed when I inevitably started to gain weight. Now I get hungry again from eating so much more normally than before and struggle much harder not to eat certain things…. So I’ve fallen into a cycle of B/P, sort of. My brain considers eating anything that I wish I didn’t to be a binge, so we are talking about normal portions of these things. I hope that makes sense? 

This leads me to last night. My friend saw me take a small slice of banana bread and was asking if I'd ever had it fried, and I said I'd never even had banana bread before now. My friends are very keen on pressuring me to eat, so he went to fry us both a piece. I'm a passive people pleaser, but I did say like ""that's *so much* butter."" He said to trust him. Butter is one of the things my brain gets the most mad about, if not the top of the list. I'd have never eaten that in a million years. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely delicious. It was really hard to eat even with all of the peer pressure, and my brain tried really hard to keep me from swallowing it so I had to try several times and basically yo-yo it. 

My friends don't let me go to the bathroom right after I eat, which is fair but I hate it anyway. I had needed to go buy more monster so I went to do that, and I slipped a gallon ziplock bag into my pocket. A ziplock bag is not a very wide opening, so despite being careful I still got it all over my lap. I then had to decide what would be more embarrassing... walking into my friends house in just a T-shirt and dance shorts (because that's what was under my hoodie and jeans, and it was cold) and having to come up with a reason I'd remove layers when it's like 1°c outside, or walking into the petrol station covered in yeet and washing my things off in the bathroom sink there. I chose the latter.

I don't think I've ever been as ashamed as I felt while I was driving home at 9pm in wet clothes and shivering violently. That was my fault entirely and a new low for me.",1640883290.0

I've lived so much with my life with ""number go down = good"" as basically my motivating factor that I don't know how to live without that.

I don't have a scale at my place otherwise I have the urge to weight myself all the time and I obsess over it. When I go to my boyfriend's place, he knows he has to hide his scale otherwise I'll be driven to it like some kind of light-obsessed moth. But because of the holidays, I spent some time at my grandmother' place and I was able to weight myself.

This is so weird, because I feel like my body is gross and enormous. I don't find fat people gross, it makes me so angry whenever my best friend's mom call her ugly because of her fat. I only have that kind of hatred towards myself.

I was sure I had gained, I have urges of depreciating myself and sometimes I say it out loud. My boyfriend told me that he actually found me thinner and that I had to watch out. The thing is... he's so thin himself. His body is what I wish I had. He doesn't have any eating disorders, he's just naturally so thin, so it's easy for him to say.

The scale says he's right, but it's doesn't make any sense to me. This is not how I feel nor what I see. It's like I was looking at a reflection of myself from a parallel dimension that no one can see except from me, yet I'm the one who has to live with this reflection since I cannot see anything else.

So I've been trying to rationalize it. ""It's only the eating disorder lense"". And now, this adds show up on Reddit... Fuck. I don't even look up for anything related to diets on internet, I never did any diet but ""stop eating point blank""... I don't know why I'm so sensitive about it. It's like, I'm slowly accepting that what I see is a distortion, and here this Reddit add is catching up and saying ""No, that's actually true"".

I don't know where I'm going with that post. I think I just needed to vent.

Mental Distress About My Life,2,rrs3rw,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rrs3rw/mental_distress_about_my_life/,1,"Even before ana, I was a long distance runner. When I started to lean into anorexic tendencies obviously I used running to burn calories and turned exercise into something not healthy but I still loved running. Now that I've been in forced quasi recovery for about a year, I haven't been officially allowed to run. This summer I was running a lot on my own with my parents knowledge but not the doctors, and I had really high hopes of returning to school and returning to my sport on a team. That did not happen and instead I got admitted to the hospital again. It's been about two months since the last time I ran as of today. I'm allowed very little exercise, barely even allowed to walk around my neighborhood despite my vitals looking healthy and everything being somewhat okay. I am still underweight but I have been for the majority of my life, pre and ""post"" anorexia. I'm not in school right now and I'm really struggling with the workload because I am online while my school is in person and they aren't being very accomodating. I lost my job because I can't go into work and while it's not that serious because I don't need a job, I was very happy when I got it and looking forward to making my own money. I have a lot of anxiety and stress and a whole bunch of other feelings about my situation and I just don't see it getting better. It's so pathetic, I don't want my life to be like this anymore but I also don't want to recover traditionally. I am already eating pretty regular and decent portions while maintaining weight I don't understand why that can't be enough. Exercise is the main thing frustrating me in this moment. I miss running so so much. 

TL;DR: I'm in a bad place and could use some words of encouragement or just anything from personal experience that could help me maybe get through this. Not to sound too desperate or crazy but it feels like there's no point anymore and I just cant live like this anymore.

Fast forward two years into our relationship and he had at that time seen me get to my official goal weight, I was able to now fit into his clothing and share it with him; I felt untouchable and felt like the skinny emo guy I always wanted to be. Now that I have put all my weight back on I cant take pictures of myself, I can't look at myself in the mirror and I have trouble taking care of myself sometimes. I have started slipping back into my disordered eating because I want to be attractive for him again.

I can't lose myself to this disorder again but at the same time I just want to be skinny again and have the comfort of self control that comes from it again. It hurts so bad",1640708139.0

i really need some advice since i am completely lost atm.   
For some information, i was kind of in a healthy body and mindset the last few years.   
I worked out and ate healty, feeling kind of good.   
But two years ago i got into a depressive episode, the COVID situation, lockdowns, stress at work, etc. made it really worse. Maybe these were even the trigger points. So i gained a lot of weight because i couldn't work out anymore, nor did i have the energy to cook properly.   
After i gained a lot of weight, i had to deal with really harsh comments from all sides. At work people pointed out that i looked worse then ever before, that i should really watch out being that unhealthy.  
My whole family started going at me, commenting on my body changes, that i need to stop eating.  
Worst of all my boyfriend kind of jokes about my weightgain all the time. He even compliments me when i'm skipping lunch or dinner. Says how attractive he finds other peoples bodies while he looked me in the eyes and told me how much weight i gained. This all made me go down a more depressive spiral. 

The last few weeks have been hard. I lost a lot of weight because i can barely eat. Everytime someone offers me food i just hear all the bad comments, my belly aches and i just feel overwhelmingly bad for even having a thought of eating it. I feel like i would disapoint my family and boyfriend. I talked with my therapist about it, but he didn't really take it seriously and said that i have enough problems at the moment who need to be fixed. And that an eating disorder commonly occurs only among women. I can't change my therapist right now, since others are fully occupied. 

I just feel exhausted, i have no energy most of the time. I was such an open, selfconfident, active person. Nothing of this is left. I changed and i don't know what to do.

We don’t have sex anymore.  He’s almost 50 and his last two partners before me were 21 and 25. He watches a lot of porn and had really unrealistic expectations.  I’m 40 and now I feel fat and revolting. I’m a big, fat disappointment to him, when he’s the one who pushed for this change.

I made the mistake of telling him I still masturbate, even though we’re not having sex, and he is MAD!!  Sex drive has very little to do with masturbating for me. I’m not horny, not in the mood, not really enjoying it, just getting off as fast as possible for the pick-me-up. 
Now, when he sees me eating ‘too much’ he comments because her knows how I feel about my body and he can’t just sit there and watch me make things worse’— worse for him, because he’s not getting laid.

 my family & i have gone away for xmas & are staying in an apartment. for the weeks leading up too xmas i started too come out of a deep place in my ed & sort of made my peace with not wanting too restrict/ engage in ed behaviours as much and things got a little better.

took sf w me, although when i was home i didn't rly eat them and felt comfortable being more adventurous with my food & eating. but now im away its like i panicked and started engaging in ed behaviours and thoughts of restriction r much stronger. maybe because it feels unfamiliar or i feel too out of control. 

i cant rly eat vegan when im here just vegetarian because its way too complicated for my family too cater too- which i get and am ok w doing. my family made random comments about my eating habits or my previous ones ( like oh remember when u used too weigh ur food etc) which i trued too shift topic v quickly cause they have no clue ab my struggles.
 my brother hardly eats (not ed related but idk) & my mum expressed her concern. it all just makes me sad and mad and want too restrict even more & now im sat here when everyone's eating breakfast on boxing day and cant even eat/ join in.

i just found christmas much much harder than i thought it would. which makes me kinda sad. part of me is happy that i want too restrict more again but idk. this whole thing is just messed up. i dont like christmas anymore. 
i just dont know what too feel anymore and i feel guilty over eating when others diddnt and eating more than others. they all hardly ate which makes things so much harder.

What exactly is a relapse?,6,rold26,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rold26/what_exactly_is_a_relapse/,3,"I'll go straight to it.

I'm a 26M, I first got sick with anorexia when I was 20, it lasted about a year. I've had a few minor slips here and there these past years.

About two months ago, I started counting calories again and restricting the food I eat. The thing is, it's not nearly as bad as it was when I was 20. Back then, I had a calorie limit and if I passed, it would nearly destroy me. I would never eat outside, I'd do a lot of exercise, etc.

Now, even though not eating is very much always in my mind and I still avoid going out to eat. It's not as scary. If I pass the limit I do feel bad, but it doesn't destroy me.

But every day I wake up hoping I don't go over my limit and yet, I hope I do. I was miserable back then. I don't want to go back, but I do. ¿?

It's confusing.

Anyway, I've been thinking of this as a relapse, but now I'm not even sure.

This is a long shot, I'm not asking of medical advice, just maybe an opinion?

Back before i worked out i could just fast without issue but i cant anymore. I wanna eat breakfast but i can’t - i’ll just feel unbelievably guilty because I told myself i WOULDN’T and what would doing it say about my willpower? I shouldn’t eat it if I’m not allowed to. 

I feel like such a fake because i eat regularly, despite my intake being pretty low, despite all my physical symptoms and the fact that obsessive thoughts about food/exercise/my weight control literally my whole life - not being able to prove myself through fasting anymore makes me feel like I’m not sick at all. I cant even say that i have an ED without feeling like such a liar. 

I just wish i could be normal :)) but Im stuck in the cycle of “I’m not even sick i don’t need help and even if i was and did need / get help id gain weight and I’m not at a weight low enough for that to be okay” its so frustrating.

How do you “feel” skinny?

How do you get rid of the imperfect image you see in the mirror and step away long enough just to eat a meal.

For picking the foods you told me not to. Even if it was irrational.

I love you, Ana. You dull my emotions, you take my focus, you destroy my health, and I love you anyways.

A toxic relationship with a disorder is a toxic relationship with your mind.

So a while ago i had this friend, she went vegan due to guilt and sympathy towards the animals, may i add i am completely respectful and tolerant towards other people's diets, i dont care if people go vegan aslong as they share a mutual respect for my diet as i do for theirs. I was once eating a Hotdog, as meat was a food i was advised to eat by my doctors and i felt comfortable eating meat. I was shamed and labelled an animal ab*ser and r*pist for eating my safe foods, and as i have OCD these words stuck with me and became a mild theme of mine, i now avoid animal products at all costs due to fear of being an animal r*pist, since i dont usually eat often due to my Eating disorder, and my Doctor advised against me attempting diets like Veganism, Vegetarianism, Etc, and i essentially live off 2 Cans of Fanta a day. 

I have Developed an Iron Deficiency due to me not eating meat as it was my only source of iron and protein, I am completely aware of the issues within the Meat industry and believe it is cruel, and i am completely sympathetic towards the tortue and suffering animals endure in these industrial farms, even then whenever i would purchase meat, i would buy it from a farmers market as i believe they may be alot more humane than the Industrial farms.

I do not believe it is correct for me to be shamed for not complying to a diet which i have been medically advised against, but i also understand from their point of view they dont see the world and food the same way i do, they do not feel the need to count every single calorie they consume within the day, whereas i do, and i presume they also dont have sensory issues with food. I cannot eat Mushrooms and alot of vegan meat substitute bases due to my sensory issues, even if i were able to be vegan my diet would still be limited due to these sensory issues, i see their point of view and im aware they are likely blind to my point of view and how i see things. But im unsure if im in the wrong for even telling her about my meat eating because she does have emotional/mental health issues related to meat and animals which have caused her feeling the need to go vegan. I just felt as if i could confine in her? But i would like someone's perspective on the situation.

Husband has just triggered me MASSIVELY,21,rmd6sk,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rmd6sk/husband_has_just_triggered_me_massively/,2,"So I've relapsed really hard over the last couple weeks. I've been so anxious about eating over christmas, it's all I can think about.


My husband convinced me that I should let myself eat more over christmas starting today, to not let my ED ruin the Christmas mood and I should let myself enjoy the holiday and eat. I was really nervous because I cannot just eat little bits of this and that, if I eat then I'm going to EAT. A lot.

So earlier we went to the corner shop and bought food for christmas. I've really been craving a trifle, and they didn't have any little pots so I bought a bowl of it.


3 hours later, I'd eaten the whole thing. I did an intense workout after to try make myself feel a little better about it, since I can't purge for a few days (just had a tooth removed, thanks bulimia!).
Anyway, I showed my husband the empty bowl of trifle and he jokingly said, ""aren't you meant to be on a diet?"". He then proceeded to pick me up, pretending he was struggling, and started to jump up and down saying ""let's shake it out of you"".


I immediately burst into tears and said how can you joke about something like that when you know how much I'm struggling? He thought he didn't do anything wrong and refused to apologise, but after a long talk (a snotty talk as I was sobbing my heart out) he understood that he can't joke about things like that.

He's lit candles around the bathroom and drawn me a bath, which I'm currently sitting in, as a way to apologise.


But... the damage is done. I've eaten a whole bloody trifle and now I feel like absolute shit because of my husband. Now I feel like I mustn't eat anything els, which ABSOLUTELY SUCKS because if I knew today was a restricting day I would have saved my calories until this evening when I'm actually hungry :'(

Talking to Parents About Their Mistakes Is Hard,11,rlrk3h,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rlrk3h/talking_to_parents_about_their_mistakes_is_hard/,1,"I'm back home with my parents for the holidays. I'm happy to be home, but the holidays are always a hard time. My mom struggles with a myriad of undiagnosed mental illnesses and GAD, and my dad doesn't really understand the concept of ""mental illness"". Anyways, I'm happy to be with them but sometimes it's painful.

Throughout my childhood and teenage years my dad (and sometimes mom) would tell me that I wasn't wearing enough fabric, which was a contributor to my ano and BDD. The comments started in 4th-5th grade, when I began puberty, and it made me become super insecure. I wore sweaters to try and hide my body because I hated wearing tight fitting clothes. Naturally in middle and high school you want to wear trendy clothes, most of which is tighter fitting. During middle and high school I would hear that I was not wearing ""enough fabric"" several times each day. It only instilled a desire to hide and hate my body more than I already did.

Now, at 22 years of age, I have a significant complex regarding the clothes I wear. I struggle during the summer, because I hate to show my body and any form of skin. It's difficult going out to bars and clubs, because I hate my body in anything that isn't loose. I wear mainly baggy clothes and struggle to leave my house for mundane tasks and errands if I'm not wearing clothes that conceal my body. It's borderline incapacitating.

During the two days I've been home for the holidays, I've heard that I'm not wearing enough fabric twice now. By the way, the outfit that warranted those two comments was a turtle neck and a knee length skirt with knee high rain boots. Today at dinner, the topic of fabric and clothes came up into conversation. Finally, I told my parents that the comments were a major contributor to how I dress now and that I have a complex about how much clothing I wear.

IMMEDIATELY after saying this I become the villain. I get told that I'm sensitive and passive aggressive, and that my younger sisters get the comments too (they don't). My mom shuts down and locks herself in her room, and my dad sticks around. My dad snarkily- and kinda seriously- asks if he starts to compliment me will it undo the insecurities. I answer honestly and say it won't, and that I spent the formative years of my life learning to hate my body, and that I see my body as a cage and that I wish have a different one or to change it to be more conventional. He effectively says ""whatever, I'll still try"", and that's how the convo ended.

I understand it's hard for parents to hear about their shortcomings, but I think that it's still necessary to talk about them. My parents were a major contributor to my ano, and I hate that they act like they didn't assist in creating the toxic conditions for me to develop or prolong one. They don't want to hear that their new-founded Western (and paradoxically untraditional) beauty standards they raised me with destroyed my self esteem and opinions of who I am. It hurts to tell them that they didn't succeed in everything, because I want them to think that they did. I love them, and I know that they ""tried"" to help in their own way after I got my diagnoses in middle school. I know that deep down they know they failed me too. It hurts being honest.",1640130510.0

Just had a baby and struggling,4,rltqt9,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rltqt9/just_had_a_baby_and_struggling/,2,"I was last hospitalized between the ages of 15 and 16, but I've had anorexia since I was 13 or 14. I considered myself ""recovered"" after inpatient and outpatient treatment because I never lost as much weight as that time or even hit rock bottom with my ED. Little did I know that the entire decade-long span of time since then (I'm 26 now) has been fraught with relapses. When I was 23-24 my weight dropped again to an unhealthy degree due to a behavior I didn't really associate with anorexia, and when I regained the weight after spontaneously attempting intuitive eating (in an attempt to lose weight ????) I suddenly realized what had been happening and tried my best to do better. My husband helped me a lot during this time, supporting my eating and exercising in the best possible ways. 

Then I became pregnant in January 2021. Things were fine at first until the third trimester when some of my favorite clothing stopped fitting over my belly. I restricted my intake until the midwives became worried for the baby (she is fine, I was at a healthy weight before I got pregnant and stayed within a healthy range despite the restriction. She was thankfully born larger than most) and then began eating normally again when they informed me that I was risking causing harm. Once again, I almost didn't notice my behaviors creeping back. I knew I was restricting, but I didn't think my restriction was actually making any difference if that makes sense. I thought actually that I was gaining a lot of weight the whole time (I refuse to buy a scale so I didn't know). 

Anyways, I gave birth to my daughter in November and have struggled ever since with the postpartum changes in my body. I have stretch marks on my stomach now. Not a lot, but that was my one big body fear with pregnancy. And, of course, immediately after birth and for about a month my uterus was still shrinking back to its regular size so it looked like I had extra ""fat"" on my stomach for some time, whereas I was previously always willing to like my stomach more than other parts of my body. There were many other little things I may as well not get into, but the point is that pregnancy and birth have all been very triggering. I comforted myself throughout my pregnancy by telling myself that I could control my body and my food after birth, and now I actually am. I'm eating less and less each day, while breastfeeding (which is not a good idea and I know this). And on top of that I've just been ""cleared"" for exercise. 

It feels like things are getting out of control again and honestly I don't know if I can put in the effort towards ""recovery"" right now. And my baby is still so new, still so unaware of her surroundings, and such an easy baby to take care of, that it feels like my eating disorder won't affect her and that I can continue like this without undesired consequences. I just want to feel in control again, you know?

I still haven't told my husband what's been going on in my head.",1640137111.0

During this time eating as little as possible and celebrating the weight loss was my only solace. Long story short, I eventually started to worry a bit when I started experiencing weakness and dental problems after never even having a cavity before then. This led to my decision to take control of my life and try eating what I wanted without guilt. Well, I ended up being more successful then I had hoped and put on quite a bit of weight over the past few years. This would not be such a big deal except for the fact that I have now become the target of small comments from my family and friends. Comments such as comparing me to thinner people, assuming I wear certain clothing sizes, commenting on my belly and saying I “have filled out.” I don’t think people realize how much these comments hurt, and honestly I don’t even want to tell them because if that’s really how they feel I’d rather they say it than lie to me. I would like to lose a bit of weight for health reasons, but their comments are causing me to want to slip back into unhealthy patterns and drop the weight as fast as possible. I wish I didn’t but I feel like I have something to prove to these people now. And I also miss the praise I used to get when I was thinner. It’s funny because no one was aware of my unhealthy eating habits but they were quick to praise my thin body.

I'm so tired.,21,rk3iz9,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rk3iz9/im_so_tired/,2,"I've not been this sick in ten years. 
I'm mad at myself for getting excited when the number on the scale drops. 
I'm mad at myself for believing I can function on lesd than a child. 
I'm mad at myself for not being able to fight harder, and for letting things go this far. 
I feel really lost and really trapped and I'm just hoping I can make it out again. 

Today I've pushed to cook an actual meal which I'm eating right now (slow cooker lasagne) and it's draining me of energy to keep fighting down every bite. 

I hate my ED. I hate anorexia. 

But part of me still loves it, and that's making everything so hard.",1639941389.0
Can't seem to figure out how to eat healthily,9,rk74bu,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rk74bu/cant_seem_to_figure_out_how_to_eat_healthily/,5,"Hello, I used to struggle with anorexia as a teenager and have since recovered, but I now really struggle with knowing how to eat healthily and I suppose, overeating as a way to compensate for times when I used to not eat. I either overeat and eat whatever I want (like cakes, etc.) or I eat really healthily, and then feel stupid that I am 'missing out' on good food and return to overeating. Sometimes I just think I am fine being very overweight, the same way I used to think I would be fine if I were very thin during my anorexia days. I just can't seem to strike a balance and I wonder if anyone knows of any YouTube videos or resources to help me understand what 'healthy' looks like, a healthy that includes a balance of 'fun' foods and food that is actually nutritious and good for your body. Thank you and please let me know if this post would be better placed in another community.",1639951812.0
F*ck being thin!,104,rjskx3,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rjskx3/fck_being_thin/,15,"Took photos on the beach yesterday, and at first I freaked out because I'm quite uncomfortable with my (very large) breasts and you know not being skin and bones any more, but at a second glance I realized I am hot as hell. 
First time feeling comfortable at this weight, and it's very liberating!!!",1639902923.0
Royal Melbourne hospital inpatient,3,rkbpia,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rkbpia/royal_melbourne_hospital_inpatient/,1,"I’m being admitted sometime this week and I was wondering if anyone had been and can give me some info on what it was like/ if it helped them. I truly want to recover but I can’t from home as no one can force me to eat and not purge. I also think not having control of the food/having to make it will help me recover as it’s a big part of my eating disorder. 
Any info will be appreciated thanks!!",1639965204.0
Acne in recovery,5,rk9yuw,AnorexiaNervosa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rk9yuw/acne_in_recovery/,2,"Okay so I always had bad acne when I was younger (for reference I’m F18) but while I was deep in my ED my skin actually cleared up. Sure it was a bit dry, but it was manageable. Now I’m in residential treatment going on 3 weeks and my skin has never been more oily. My cystic acne is back and my hair gets greasy in less than a day. Has anyone else experienced this? If so when does it go away? I’m having a hard enough time finding motivation to recover and this isn’t exactly helping.",1639959976.0
