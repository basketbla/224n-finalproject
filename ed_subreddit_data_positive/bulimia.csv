I don't know what is wrong with me. I'm a 19 F and this past week has been super rough for me. My closest friend at school started to turn wrong after two hour make-out session and it really confused me. I started binging and purring and self harming (which I've never self-harmed before). I told him I needed space to think and this weekend went to visit my grandmother, sister, and mom. I was excited to go see them, but they all have strong personalities and I often feel like I just shut down around them. I feel so invisible and they all fight the whole time and I never get a word in. We went shopping yesterday because my sister has a conference and needed to by dress pants and something triggered me. I was in the dressing room with her and recognized the look of disgust and self-hate on her face and it really bothered me. My sister has never had body image issues and I guess it just made me feel really sorry for her and not want her to experience this. But it bothered her the rest of the day. And at dinner I started to get really stressed and I was eating a lot more and they started to talk about body image more. It gave me a lot of anxiety and I had to leave to ""shower"" and just purged. And when I came back they had no idea (still don't) and kept arguing. I sat at the table and tears just started to stream down my face for about 10 minutes, before my sister noticed and asked what is wrong. And then I just said how overwhelmed I feel and how I came this weekend more for them than for me. And how I wanted to come see them, but being around them just gives me too much anxiety. My sister and mom and I talked for a while. My mom has never been ever to really provide my sister or I emotional support, she loves us but shows it by trying to fix out problems and do things for us. And I tried to explain that, but I should have just kept my mouth shut. But everything in my life seems to do that, it's like I just can't have friends or anything I get attached to because I worry. My mom seemed really shut down and so did my sister. Before I went to bed my sister was like why did you even come here if you didn't want to? And she said you really hurt mom. I started to get images of cutting myself really strong, but I just feel like complete shit. I am a monster. I am destroying my family.",1645362203.0

My teeth are destroyed, my digestive system is ruined and I’m stuck at my heaviest weight while I heal and get healthy safely. I can’t diet yet incase I relapse because another relapse could do some serious damage.

Has anyone here ever tried this stuff? I've been reading reviews and such, but I'm still just wondering if any frequent purgers have tried it

I haven't been to the dentist since 2018 because of those horror stories of bulimic people going in for basic checkups, but ending up having to get tooth removals later on as a result from their visit.  Around 2019 - 2021, I was purging every day, between 3 - 9 times a day; I took a break from purging Around the end of 2021, but I started again recently. I do my best to take care of my teeth, I do baking soda rinses in between each time I purge, I floss once a day, and I try brushing 2 or more times a day, but I'm still worried about my teeth. I think I have some tartar buildup on my back teeth, and I never struggled with teeth sensitivity until now

Bad Therapist in NYC/CT Area!,35,swgmio,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/swgmio/bad_therapist_in_nycct_area/,7,"TW: ED, Sexual Assault, and Self-Harm

Just wanted to share some of my experiences with Dr. Sarah Selden - truly the worst clinician I have encountered over my time in New York City. She is a private practice therapist in NYC and works with the Greenwich Mental Health Group in Connecticut.

What started out as a maybe not ideal, therapy relationship went completely downhill after 2 years. Though she was not very good at her job, she didn't begin to display an abusive pattern until after I returned from studying abroad with my university.

Dr. Selden repeatedly failed to do her job - instead of teaching me communication skills, she labeled all the people around me as narcissists (ironic in the least) and created a completely false world around me, sat by as my eating disorder got worse and worse, laughed in my face when I told her I was sexually assaulted and when I showed her that I had self=harmed worse than I ever had.

The so-called ""Dr."" Selden failed to repeatedly reach out when her job was too difficult for her and eventually broke confidentiality by calling my parents and had me hospitalized when I was not displaying any suicidal urges. The timing of this hospitalization was solely to keep me from attending school, which had started that week.

Dr. Selden then called the only psychiatrist in my hometown and informed her that I was 'too difficult of a patient to deal with', leading that psychiatrist break with me and to suggest care 100 miles away. This was after a suicide attempt brought on by the abuse perpetrated by Dr. Selden.

Dr. Selden failed on numerous occasions to display basic empathy for her patient. She also wasted my insurance, spending sessions rambling about my visit abroad, even years later.

I spent 4 years under Dr. Selden's care and regret every moment of it. I wish I had left earlier.

Please do not subject yourself to what I went through.

(I would like to add that her colleague, Jill Ahluwahlia P-NP is a wonderfully nice psychiatrist. I am only talking about the care I received under Dr. Selden.)",1645295640.0

Questions about recovery,6,swgg36,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/swgg36/questions_about_recovery/,0,"Hi there, been bulimic for about four years after losing 80+ pounds and being scared to gain it back. Have started talking to treatment places after admitting to my friend i vomit my food and realizing I have a problem. Don’t binge in secret, tend to overeat at restaurants and then throw up at home as i restrict heavily when I eat at home.
Last night, after two weeks of heavy restricting and not purging, I went out with some friends and broke while snacking and proceeded to get more food from a drive-thru and binge it at home and then purge. I was very adamant up until that point about quitting purging cold turkey (even have a days counter app) and have told a lot of my friends to keep an eye on me, but i did not feel bad at all when i purged last night. It made me feel great, and I don’t feel disappointed in myself at all today. 
I was wondering if anyone else felt this way? Not feeling bad when you relapse? Tips to remind yourself not to purge when you want to? Stories about recovery? I start out patient Monday but it will be a slow process.
Also was wondering if anyone had jaw problems from their bulimia. Had lockjaw once a couple years ago and realizing it was most likely from this.

Not constantly, mind you, I've had some better and some worse years but in the last 6 months I have relapsed again due to heightened stress levels in my life. I've been finding myself binging and purging more than usual and last week I said enough. I've now been 7 days binge and purge free. 
Today I was home alone which is always a trigger for me and unfortunately apart from having breakfast and lunch I started having cravings, resulting in me eating a Nutella sandwich, some chocolate and 2 small muffins. I felt the need to go and purge all of it but I knew once I do this I'll continue eating and purging and eating....so I managed to pull myself away and go clean the house. It's now been 2 hours and the urge is gone! I am so happy, still feeling guilty about the food but it's such a huge step. Hope that's a start to improvement",1645205690.0

I can’t drink or get high without my heart feeling dead. Anyway, the only reason I started puking was because my mum got sick of me being ugly so she put me on a really strict diet. She always made me get operations and go to beauty salons to change my appearance. On her diet, I wasn’t allowed anything like carbs, sugar, spices, garlic, most fruit, etc. I got sick of restricting so of course I started binging. I sometimes went out to Chinese restaurants with friends, but I would get told off if she could smell it on my breath. Now I’ve been stuck suffering with this for 4-5 years, and I never have any energy to do anything. If I try not to to restrict without purging, I get chronic diarrhoea and nausea. I feel like I’m going to pass out all the time. I never have energy. I’m even at risk of losing my job because of my issues. What can I do?

They just cut it open and there was fucking pus coming out of my tooth! So basically it's dead and theyll soon have to fill it up completely. 
I'm 18. I shouldnt be loosing teeth. I only got these ones for the rest of my life!
I'm still bawling my eyes out. I told them that I have bulimia and that it started four years ago. And the nurse and dentist were the first medical staff that was kind to me in response. Every other doctor made fun of me or talked to my parents as if I wasn't in the room. Being treated so degradingly I became too scared to ask for the help I need(ed). 
If my GP would have just gotten me into recovery when I was 14 instead of making jokes about how orange my skin is turning, I might not be fucking losing theeth now.
And it makes me so sad and angry that it's mostly my fault as well. I just hope this was enough of a wake-up call for me to take recovery seriously.",1645190290.0

I limited carbs to nothing knowing that I would just to lose water weight and look leaner and I basically ate only protein ! What? you thought I would be on keto? No no no... 


So basically after losing all the weight cause I was basically starving, being dyhydrated, was tired with low blood pressure and hunger was through the roof at some point I got a stomachache cause I couldn't digest some kiwis and I used my fingers and then I wanted to make it a hobby ! 
Cause binging feels sooo great when you are lighter than you can handle and restrict trust me , I was out of control at some point though and I wanted all of this to stop 


After fighting at recovering then months later I relapsed and then I fucked up everything so fucking bad and gained weight like a lot of it and I looked the way I was before ever dieting 🥺🥺🥺


So I felt like shit cause I thought I had everything figured out, I feel like I wasted my time badly and I got to a position worse than square 1 and I hate this , even though I deserve 100 % of this. The thing that hit me real hard from all of this, was the fact that when I gained weight and continued these habits, even the binging part was sad, I hated forcing food down for the sake of purging it after. And I felt this way cause I don't need anymore food, because I was fat enough to not crave it at that point . For that I feel angry frustrated and sad

Then of course got home and somehow launched right back into B/P habits which sucked, but this past Sunday I had a particularly bad binge/purge session and it left me with a lot of unpleasant physical effects and something in me just sort of clicked like “oh i really DON’T want to keep feeling like this” 

So on Sunday night I journaled a lot and wrote a few things down to put on my mirror when I’m having urges and honestly it’s helped a lot. I haven’t B/P since Sunday, which means this is coming on day 4 of staying clean.

I started a new job, my living situation is a lot healthier, and now with the added plus of not b/p-ing all the time, I just feel a lot better.

My husband (very recent status change, married a month ago haha) has been bulimic almost our entire relationship. He is getting better whereby he at least now acknowledges he has a problem, something that now means he can recover in my eyes. He does NOT want to keep binging and purging, but he can't seem to stop. He won't get help, not even consider it. He has spent all of his money (and mine) doing this, and I know it tears him up. He is scarily skinny, like full on skeleton, ribs/spine/hips protruding. I'm terrified. 

I have been the most supportive person imaginable going through this with him, I am the only one who knows, I can't tell my family, the lies almost broke us but he has since turned a new leaf, the only saving grace of our relationship. 

I guess why I'm posting is to ask you, as sufferers of this ED, what can I do to help him? What can I do for myself? I can feel the resentment building in me, between the continuing lies (albeit it smaller ones) to the dwindling bank accounts, my own mental health is crushing me, I've been to three different counsellors and the only thing they tell me is to leave him — absolutely not an option.

I would do anything for him, and I will, but I can honestly say 3 years into this, where every day is a struggle and every day stunts our ability to function as a couple (no intimacy whatsoever, no future planning or growth, no fun activities, just eating) it's killing me.

Like most of us I've strugged with an ED for years.
It really took off after I had weight loss surgery last March.

I was b/p every day, to the point that I was really hurting myself.
Well I haven't really stopped doing that.
Currently I'm going through detox and withdrawal from prescription xanax and zoloft.
And my ""craving"" for the drug has come out in food form, and I've had no energy to purge any of the massive amounts I've taken in, I've not even had energy to think about the possible weight until just a while ago. When my partner said he was glad to see me eating because I looked so sickly back when I was b/p (keep in mind that was less than a month ago)

And suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks. All the food I've been eating to supplement my cravings, and I hated my body all over again. Even more so now because I know I've put on weight. I just know it.
So even though I'm in pain from withdrawal, I forced myself to through up for 45 minutes and now I just want to bawl my eyes out.

To him I look better huge and bloated from eating than I did when I was purging (aka, when I felt as good as I can about my body)

i’ve been bulimic for many years now but for almost a month i’ve been purge free. it will be a month next friday and the reason why i stopped was because i came to this realisation that this has gone on for way too long, i had such a “bulimic” face, my teeth aren’t in the best condition with me getting told over and over the enamel is wearing away which scares me and overall i don’t want this to be my life forever 

fast forward to now almost a month purge free, im eating normally, not binging anymore but it’s i’m still getting thoughts about going back to purging. i still haven’t grasped that feeling full after eating a normal sized portion of food is normal. i haven’t exactly “escaped” my ed you know but at the same time, fully escaping scares me as i’ve relied on it for so long it’s “helped” me in a way, so what would i do without it. 

it just feels like i’m constantly doing the wrong thing when in reality me not purging is the “right thing”, does that make sense? it’s as if me engaging in my ed is me doing the right thing as that’s all i’ve known for years, yes it’s draining, the day after b/ping is always brutal but now i’m not doing it at all, it doesn’t feel right?

it’s like this constant battle with myself. what do i really want? i don’t really want this to be my life forever, i don’t want to have fillings, i don’t want to puke and then have my heart racing feeling like this is it, so i try my hardest to make a change but my eating disorder still keeps me trapped….",1645039113.0

Something that helped me recover,1,su4535,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/su4535/something_that_helped_me_recover/,1,"One thing that I realized was that ED is a slippery slope. When you do BP few times your electrolytes go out of whack and electrolytes are very very important to maintaining mood and mental health.

This is what happened to me. My mental health deteriorated as my BP increased and at one point it was my anxiety and my mental health that was driving my regular BP habits and not the other way around.

The biggest impact of electrolyte imbalance I saw was on my mental health. The next day after BP I would wake up groggy and depressed and just a constant sinking feeling in my stomach probably from irritation in my easophagus. These were very very direct signs of how BP was making me depressed, anxious and in turn pushing me to BP more.

I was able to recover by temporarily stopping BP and focussing really hard on the mental health aspect because after you stop it can take several days to weeks to balance your electrolytes etc and also reduce anxiety that was particularly induced by BP episodes.

Other than that electrolyte imbalance is very bad for brain and heart health. It can give you arrhythmias. I have also read research where it can lead to a stroke and even a heart attack. 

You just need to break that cycle of ED and anxiety driving each other and making each other stronger. If you are able to do that even for a week that's a win, next time till will be 2 weeks and hopefully slowly you will recover fully.",1645039766.0

TW talk about relapse in recovery,3,stodec,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/stodec/tw_talk_about_relapse_in_recovery/,0,"I am struggling. I was recently in treatment for an ED. I was in PHP and then IOP from April-July of 2022. I have been in “recovery” for 10 months, and out of intensive treatment for 7. Since I stepped down to outpatient, I have been working with a dietitian and a therapist. However, I actually discontinued services with a therapist last fall due to unprofessionalism on her part. I have been looking for one since then, but it is difficult because there is not an ED therapist near me that takes my insurance. The closest is 2 hours away. Although they do teletherapy, it is difficult to schedule an appointment because of my work/school/internship schedule.
Anyway, during last fall, around the end of November, I really started to question if I wanted to be in recovery. I decided that I didn’t care to be in recovery, made up a new eating and exercise plan, and even started to follow it. However, because my dietitian is a good one, I admitted what was going on, we talked about recovery and my goals, I thought about it, and a couple weeks later, I ultimately decided that recovery was a journey I wanted to take. 
Now, I am questioning it again. For the past couple of weeks, I have been trying to follow a strict regime.  I have been drinking a Fair Life protein shake for breakfast, having a FitCrunch protein bar for lunch, and drinking a Celsius as a snack or at lunch. I still have normal dinners so that my family doesn’t realize what is going on. There hasn’t been weight loss yet, but I am hopeful. I think it’s because I have been slipping some with strictness and I have been unable to purge.
I really feel like I am nothing without an ED. Even though most people don’t know I have an ED, I guess it ties into my identity some privately. Without it, I feel out of control. But I also feel out of control with it, particularly when binging.
I feel like all these relapses in recovery prove that I can’t do it. If I could, I wouldn’t have relapsed so much and so hard. It’s especially disheartening to see the statistics of people who get better and actually make a full recovery from ED.I feel like I’m at the end of my rope, and if this is gonna kill me, at least let me die skinny.",1644990597.0

Drunken Journaling,16,stayck,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/stayck/drunken_journaling/,3,"I’m not a hateful person. I subscribe to the belief that violence solves nothing. It is a means to no end. It is fighting fire with a can of hairspray. Hell, I’m vegan. I don’t just preach nonviolence, I live it. However, for you, I make the exception with no guilty conscience. I would not flinch at the opportunity to go full Office Space on you. Cue the Geto Boys. You are the bane of my existence. This goes past animosity. This goes past loathing. This goes past resentment or disdain. There is no language in the English dictionary strong enough to accurately and concisely convey how much I detest you to a violent degree. I’ve never thrown a punch and I've never been a fan of particularly gory action films, but I’ve got a vivid imagination.

You are a sinister swindler that worms itself into the brain to shrewdly and relentlessly destroy every aspect of life, all the while convincing the host you are a mild threat, fully under control. “You won this time, but next time… next time …”

I see your tricks. I know your tricks. I am fully aware of who is talking to me at this point, yet I continue**d** to listen. I continue**d** to delude myself. Anoint me with cap n’ bells for I am the ultimate fool. Why are you so fucking loud? I’ve never found a decibel level deafening enough to drown you out. Even if I could, like I said, you’re cunning. You learned to mask your voice in mine. You weaseled your way in my subconscious, replicated my thought process, and discerned every weakness in order to craft the perfect, winning argument every time. And then you no longer needed arguments. You’d just say puke and I’d say “aye-aye, captain!” because you are steering the ship.

You need a repeat customer to keep this grift going, so you learned to soothe me in a babbling stream of lies and false hopes and promises of redemption. “Today! Today’s the day! No, *today’s* the day. *Today*.” How many “today’s” until tomorrow comes? I’ve been waiting for tomorrow for years.

This is not an amateur thief with a small loot in mind. It wants everything. It will repo your life. More tenacity than a debt collector. Relationships. Friendships. Passions. Work. Mental sanity. Emotional stability. Physical health. Self worth. Personality. Hope. Happiness. The capability to get through the day without crying unless faded and inebriated.

Unfortunately, I’m your ideal target. Like many, I exited the womb with a laundry list of defects: dopamine deficient, emotionally unstable, impulsive, compulsive, lonely, anxious, depressed, and weak willed. While all manageable, when they network they recruit you.

When I first successfully purged, I didn’t think I was embarking on a voyage, I was just vacationing for the weekend. I had gotten the golden ticket. I finally hacked it. I could finally purge! This was great! This was bad, sure, but I could stop. I *would* stop. I was in control. I was the little kid in my parents lap with my hands on the steering wheel. “Look Dad! I’m driving!”

The sad reality is that I can’t do anything to you. I can’t live out my newly found Rambo-esque fantasies. You aren’t a real, physical threat. You are just a choice. You are devious, you are insidious, you are a disease, but ultimately you are a choice that I made. I own the ship. I’m responsible when it goes down. You hooked me and now I’ve sunk. 

You are the con man on the “Least Wanted” list. The reward is not finding you. I wish I had shot on foresight.",1644952945.0

I stopped restricting and ate what I crave but then one day I thought I ate too much that I wanted to give in. I was kinda angry at the moment. I told myself I wasn’t binging but it was, i was eating rapidly and purged right after. 8 months recovery does seem a lot and I did expect this would happen. I’m still the same weight when I started recovering. I didn’t feel disappointed on my weight rather than I’m comfortable with it, but all I did was relying on exercising. I don’t want to say this but I would feel fat if I didn’t sweat. 

Finding romantic interest never worked out for me, I wanted something that I could distract myself from, maybe it could help me feel better. I gained 35 lbs last year, I did felt like a loser, that my weight is what I am. I see others just being so carefree about themselves and I look at myself and see why do I just keep thinking about food, exercise, and body image. I get compliments saying that I’m pretty but I’m still self doubting, I don’t know when it’ll get better.",1644954824.0

Binges didn’t seem to be as satisfying since I would always end up eating until I would fear my stomach would actually rupture and I would feel severely nauseous so in a way it felt like punishment.

No god damn excuse this time/rant,4,ss70ci,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/ss70ci/no_god_damn_excuse_this_timerant/,2,"This will mention calories, detailed stories about exercising and weight so TW.

Ever since becoming underweight at the end of 2020 after becoming addicted to weight loss and starving myself i couldn't do it anymore and started binging, which then led to compensating by barely eating on other days and also exercising for hours. Just to show how bad it was at one point i looked at my history on the apple watch and one of the days i burned 3123 calories through exercise alone which was a 5km run, 6.47km walk, 2:56 hours at the gym with no rest, alternating doing high intensity cardio and weight lifting constantly(avg heart rate that gym session was 127 and for reference my resting heart rate is around 49), another 4km walk and then ended it with a 15 minute session on my jump rope. Total time exercising that day was a little over 6 hours altough that included the walking too but still. 

I did all that on a day off work just so i could binge later that day. I didn't realise how insane that was, sometimes i would randomly slip into good cycles where would i eat fairly normally(especially last summer where i got a bad stomach pain issues and was forced to it), no binging and no insane exercise sessions but then eventually i would slip back into the same pattern again probably because i still underate and was a little too restrictive. 

Anyway ever since around the start of january i've been doing pretty well again, i still have days where i struggle to stop exercising but it’s rare, i eat pretty well even though i still sometimes get randomly scared of eating normally and consistently and start to miss starving myself and i've only binged twice. But then it happened after that latest binge, my stomach issues started again. For almost two weeks it felt like my stomach was burning, i had pain on both sides on my upper and lower stomach and it didn't really matter what i ate i would get so much pain after altough it helped to stay away from acidic food. One night i was in so much pain i thought i would have to go to the hospital. I got so many panic attacks during those two weeks and thought my binging had ruined my stomach.

Finally now my stomach feels back to normal and this time there’s no excuse, i have to recover from this dumb ED, i know the key for me to stop binging is not to restrict calories but sometimes it’s hard and i get scared of eating consistently and want to restrict again.

Modeling and eating disorders,1,ssbe7e,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/ssbe7e/modeling_and_eating_disorders/,4,"Hi everyone! I’m 16 years old and my dream has always been to become a model someday. I’ve done some photo shoots (never professionally) and a lot of the time people ask me if I model, and when I say no, they tell me I should give it a try. 

Since the pandemic, and some other things that happened in my life, I ended up suffering from an eating disorder. I’m on recovery now, and I can tell I’m getting better.

These last days I’ve been thinking if I should try to reach out to agencies or not. I think it’s not the right time since I don’t want to get triggered, and I’m afraid of what some people can say to me. 

I’ve read that a lot of agencies don’t want people that are suffering/had suffered from an eating disorder. Is this real? I really want to be a model, but maybe I just can’t.

I’ve been in a relatively stable recovery for about a year now after 11 years of ED (anorexia followed by bulimia). During my “quasi-recovery” episodes I used to run a lot to compensate and also struggled with comparing my diet and energy to expenditure to that of my mother who is a long distance runner, in the early days of this recovery I was put on an exercise ban and really struggled with still watching my mum run a lot and eat very little. 
I now feel I am in a pretty stable place, I’ve got so much love and pride in myself for how far I’ve come, my relationship with food and my exercise feel pretty balanced and I can genuinely say I’m happy. I’ve been with my boyfriend for just under a year, and he has never known me in my ED nor does he have any experience from previous friendships/relationships. Recently he has expressed interest in wanting to run a marathon and it has triggered me a little more than im comfortable with. My initial response is that I don’t want to have that in my life again, and I don’t want to risk myself or my recovery by putting myself back in a close situation with someone who is training to a schedule. With my background I know I’ll constantly be comparing calories in vs calories out and as much as I think I will be ok, I know it will be exhausting. 
I just wondered whether I’m being a selfish ass and obviously I should be happy for him wanting to do something like this, but I can’t help feeling a little betrayed that he’s putting me in this situation? Any opinions or advice would be welcome",1644789646.0

Lately, im in a complete fog, kinda confused, kinda slurry, dizzy, shaky, movin all sloppy, and also, like?? physically cannot keep my eyelids from drooping. like i am exerting conscious effort to not look like I'm nodding, paranoid i might arouse suspicion of activities of which I'm no longer partaking; still, I really cannot explain why I look so mf weird . like, 'hey, i'm not on drugs rn, I've just puked fourteen times today but also only eaten an outrageous amount of cabbage. like. so much cabbage, you would not BELIEVE the amount of cabbage.' you cannot say this. it's absurd.

I've also started having insane mood swings following an intense period of purging. i don't recognize the ways i've started getting angry. it's so fast, so mean, and the only qualifier for a target is... being around. I don't feel anything when I snap and hurt people. It's just TV static up there. I think I like the blankness, but the indiscriminate outbursts are exhausting. Like, I'll hide in receiving at work, have a full panic attack because someone's tone seemed a little off, stealth-cry on and off for two hours, then have the 8:30am nature valley bar-which is a no-purge event!!!!! and feel like a different human being. it is very embarrassing.    

This post is extremely long, but I did wanna touch on heart stuff too? idk why, because I genuinely, truly know for a fact that I will live a long time. this is a dumb statement, I believe it 100%, and i will not elaborate. Anyway, after purging I get quite intense heart-flutters for a couple hours, chest pain (i'm p sure it's just muscle pain), heart rate will be 120-160 for probably 15 min (i'm a fit person; it stays low generally), and bad shakes. I know none of this is good, but am I hallucinating? I just don't think any of this behavior is honestly that bad, which sounds ignorant, but the human body is so resilient. I don't think I'm capable of taking this thing out single-handedly. It is kind of jarring to suddenly experience new consequences to abehavior you've been engaged in more than half your life. Is that even possible? I will say that I'm more militant in purging  than before. Like, it's gotta be bile before I quit, but I've noticed that, if i smoke a little before a session, i  can zone out and just forget I'm doing it, and it doesn't hurt so much, so I can go for like ten min without comin up for air, then repeat, repeat. in the past, I would just purge until I felt the bulk of whatever i sought to eliminate was gone, but now i can just kind of do it all day. like, now I seek the purge itself and the blankness, as opposed to the binge, then using the purge as a corrective measure. are the mood swings/mental vacancy related though? it was never like that before. i just wanna go to work, get good grades, have fun w my friends, decorate my beautiful green apartment with my tax return, and not ruin my boyfriend's life by becoming a sunken face no-tooth Embarrassing Girlfriend. Recent developments are not conducive to these goals!!!!!!!

Hi, I am a young mom (22 yr) and I have two beautiful boys (3 yr) and (10 mo). I’ve struggled with postpartum depression since having my first child, but have taken control over it through therapy and guidance from my pcp. After having my second child, I was at my heaviest I have ever been. I decided to take back my life and change everything. Through healthy eating and exercise (not fad dieting), I have managed to lose a very large number of pounds, but I still feel like the same bigger version of myself. Watching the numbers go down was a huge sigh of relief, that’s when the purging started. I was about a month into my health and weight loss journey when I finally decided to have a date night with my husband and indulge a little more than I usually did. When I got home, I felt super guilty and out of fear for gaining the weight back, I purged everything. I’ve just spiraled since then. I was using purging as a safety net, I could go out and indulge and eat however much I wanted, and it would be okay because I could just purge it later.  i’ve been very open and honest about this with my husband, and my close friends and family and we all agreed in the beginning that it wasn’t really an eating disorder, I was just being too hard on myself. I know that I am allowed to have days where I can eat, and just enjoy life, but for some reason I still found myself over the toilet. I started a new job, I work night shifts at a hospital and we are so shortstaffed that I have found myself working overtime. With starting my new job, I haven’t had time for myself, or time to go to the gym. I haven’t been able to cook as many home cooked meals, and I’ve been eating out more often. This has caused my purging to start happening multiple times a day. When I set myself up for success, plan meals out for the week, make sure I’m getting to the gym three days, I do not have any urges to purge. It is just gotten so bad lately, and I don’t know where to start. I know that this is not healthy, I work in the medical field and I know what this does to your body, but for some reason I just don’t feel strong enough.",1644743096.0

From age 13 to 21
I made myself vomit up every meal I ate, or I just wouldn’t eat. 
To feel “full” or “satisfied “ I’d binge eat to taste food.. & then force myself to throw up everything I consumed an hour later. 
I abused diet tea as well as laxatives. By the time I was 16 I would compulsively work out when I did hold food down (which was literally a salad and plan toast) to burn it all off. 
In between working out I’d try to puke up anything I could. 
I got most improved in personal fitness that year and not one single person had a clue what I was really up to. 
3 days before prom I didn’t eat so I could fit into my 24in waist 60s ball gown that didn’t really fit me to begin with…

By senior year I was Down to 119 lbs and I still saw a monster when I looked into mirrors. All I saw was flaws, my “gut”, my fat arms… i truly hated the person I was. 
I would google ways for “how to starve yourself” or xanga blogs written by teens like me with tips for bulimia/Anorexia

I wanted a thigh gap like alll the other girls, I wanted jabbing hip bones like Paris Hilton, I wanted just to be rail thin. But instead I was  emaciated and continue to hurt myself for years in weird ways. 

That’s one thing people seem to forget about the 2000s, how popular being thin was..and how damaging it was for us as people.
I’m happy the body positive movement exists today. It’s helped me so much. 

If you’re struggling like this my inbox is open. I somehow managed to break that cycle in my early 20s and haven’t looked back. It’s not easy but it is possible.

Covid And Bulimia,5,sqkl4n,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sqkl4n/covid_and_bulimia/,1,"Hi Everyone. I just wanted to share my experience with covid and how it has effected my bulimia. For context I am a 19 y/o F and have been bulimic since age 12 without any real treatment or support. I also have a ton of pre existing stomach issues. I figured it would be worth a shot posting, maybe someone will see me. 

I have been in an on and off (mostly on) battle with mia for many many years.. and sometimes it just gets a lot worse than others. With covid specifically, this is by far the worst it’s been that I can remember fully. I also have autism and it’s already incredibly hard for me to make eating decisions with safe foods constantly switching.. and money always being tight. But anyways let me get to the point. 

The week before I got Covid I was in the deepest stage of autistic burnout you can get and of course that made my bulimia creep in. Then getting Covid, of course it was very hard to eat for about a week or so.. funny enough though I was eating more while sick than I am able to eat today. Now that i’m not sick it’s made eating very very very hard. I try everything I can. I cannot even keep smoothies down.  My stomach is constantly in so much pain that it fucks with my head.. my brain LOVES the fact that I am having a hard time eating. I haven’t stepped on my scale this much in a long time. My muscles and my body are so weak, and i’m not sleeping. My hair is falling out and I feel like I have no control. I cant keep anything down and my brain is obsessed. 

It feels like im dying and nobody around me can see it. I need this to stop, I don’t want to get worse again. I’ve been trying to cope all on my own for so many years and i am so tired. I don’t know what to do. My brain gives no shits if this kills me. I need advise, please.",1644645963.0

Anyways, I went into treatment a couple years back. Did really well minimal weight gain, found my set point weight and an amazing relationship with my food and eating mindfully.

Had a bad relapse and went full swing again. I’m back on track again - I use to love running. So I started running a few times a week and started doing some gym sessions. Honestly I started gaining weight so quickly and I was so confused (I wasn’t over eating either).

I injured my hip and the exercise stopped for a couple months and now all that excess weight is falling off. Has anyone experienced something similar?

B/P free since September 2020,10,sp80nh,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sp80nh/bp_free_since_september_2020/,5,"hello.

I was bulimic for well over a decade. and now I've been b/p free since September 2020, so 17 months.

I still have days where I overeat and feel disgusting, heavy, self conscious, lack confidence, etc. but over time, I started to stop having the total lack of control and complete dissociation, and eventually stopped having the urges to binge or purge. still, very rarely, I remember the fact that I used to occupy so many of my evenings b/ping, and on particularly bad days I worry I might go back to my old ways. but those panicky moments have become weaker and significantly less frequent.

I achieved this through intuitive and mindful eating. I worked with a coach who specialises in it. I really don't want this to sound like an advertisement because it really isn't, and it was expensive and I know not everyone can afford to invest in therapy/coaching. I also know everyone is different and I just wanted to share what worked for *me*.

it took me a while to get the hang of what intuitive eating meant. initially I gained a lot of weight - probably about 5kg (10-12lbs?) which, on my 5'2 frame, is quite noticeable. I focused on eating whatever I felt like, whenever, and nothing was off limits as long as I didn't purge.

I stopped weighing myself after a few weeks into recovery. I think that's the thing that's been the weirdest yet most helpful change other than the actual eating habit. I couldn't obsess over my weight and when I was gaining a lot of weight I couldn't verify that, so I couldn't give myself a reason to give up.

the weird part is that for months, I still thought I'd been at my heavier weight. I thought ""yep I gained a lot of weight since my recovery and I'm ok with that!"" even tho I wasn't actually ok with it.. because despite my bulimia recovery, my body image issues remained. anyway, one day, I decided to try on some leggings I wasn't able to wear 8-10 months prior. and to my surprise, they fit!

aw man, you have no idea how absolutely ECSTATIC I was. I tried on every. single. piece of clothing that I couldn't fit but had kept. and I filmed videos of myself trying on different outfits and walking around in my house, just so I could SEE how I looked as I'd been avoiding ever having to really SEE myself for a long time.

my second biggest achievement since recovery was quitting smoking. I'd quit before my recovery journey, but had picked it back up a few months into recovery. I used to worry that the weight loss was actually due to smoking although that's not true at all as I was b/ping and gaining weight while I was a full time smoker previously. but still, I was so nervous to quit as I thought it'd make me snack more and gain weight, which may trigger a relapse. but I had enough confidence that with the things I learnt about mindful eating and the Allen Carr audiobook (again, not advertising), I'd be ok.

well, it's been a month since I quit and I haven't gained any weight as far as I can tell, not that that'd be a bad thing. I'm relieved, proud, happy and so grateful that I'm here, a non smoker, and free of bulimia.

I was bulimic since I was 13. and I've been smoking full time since I was about 16-17. I'm 29 about to be 30.

my bulimia wasn't always ""terrible"" if we can even say that, as in I wouldn't b/P every night. but 2-4 times a week over 15 years! and it was only getting worse and worse towards the end.
I really thought I'd never kick it and I'd be a slave to my purging and my ciggies forever.

I'm sorry about the wall of text and if any of this sounded condescending. I'm not trying to gloat, I only want to share my success and honestly I could scream at the top of my lungs ""I'm free!!!!!!"" I was suffering for 15 years and still kicked it!

I know it's not all fully over and I'm still going to have hard moments but I'm so happy to be here, alive, making this post and I really really hope to read so many more posts like this in the future from more of you.",1644503767.0

Throw me a lifeline

Live or die – horns of a dilemma

Solar plexus collapsing

Death surrounds the Posse

Find me, for I’m still missing

I’m beholden to Pain

Will to love – these ardent flames

In moments, I stared blankly at sombre skies

Starless nights, lamenting how time flies

A jarring cry inaudible to the rest

Never mind, deposit me at the blackbird’s grassy cup nest

No papering over it – ED causes distress

Exorbitant ransom, for a captive still bound

Dilute my hideous reality and I’ll still frown

so, i dunno if this is the case for everyone, but for me always after a binge, especially the most aggressive ones, i get to this state of just staring blankly into the distance and thinking ""what exactly am i doing with my life?""

something that always bothered me about being bulimic is 
a question that continously comes to me during those clarity moments. why do i keep doing this if it doesn't make me feel any good at all? 

what is it about bulimia that keeps me tied to it? everytime i binge, i do not feel good. and everytime i purge, i feel even worse. thoughts of being out of control and a failure is the only thing i'm left with (besides the extreme exhaustion)

so then, do i like to make myself feel bad? do i enjoy going to bed every night feeling like a failure, all sore and hurting? 
of course the answer is no, so why do i continue? 

i know eating disorders are not something we can simply switch off, it's not truly in our control. and this is something i've kind of surrendered to, like i can never be fixed. maybe this is why i continue.

yesterday i was home alone and b/p'ed all night. my throat is still sore today, and my salivary glands are as swollen as ever. 
i wouldn't exactly say that was rock bottom, cause i've been worse, but i just decided that it was enough. i'm turning the auto pilot off. i don't want to continue to feel like this anymore. i want to be in control of me again, i don't want bulimia to be in control of me. 

so here i am. almost a day clean. i know it's nothing, but for the first time in all my attempts to leave bulimia behind, i feel like i can actually do it. i'm writing this so i can hold myself accountable and read it again when i feel like giving up. maybe it inspires someone else.

to anyone reading this far (thank you), i want to tell you that no matter who you are, you're worth it and you do not deserve to suffer like you do. you absolutely can recover when you are ready to. please be safe and i wish you all the best♡",1644379510.0

Combination of two behavioral techniques reduces craving by over one third in problematic alcohol consumption... and why this is relevant for food craving,2,so7d90,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/so7d90/combination_of_two_behavioral_techniques_reduces/,0,"

Hello,

Excessive craving for alcohol, tobacco, or high-calorie foods is a central symptom of addiction and is involved in serious secondary disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and liver damage. Reducing craving is therefore an important goal in addiction treatment. Building upon the approach bias modification paradigm by Mike Rinck and Eni Becker, our research group developed and tested a modified technique, imaginal retraining, in participants who report problematic alcohol use, tobacco use, and obesity. Positive effects were statistically detectable but rather weak, as were the effects of the original technique (the approach bias modification paradigm; results can be found here: [https://clinical-neuropsychology.de/retraining-a-method-to-reduce-alcohol-consumption/](https://clinical-neuropsychology.de/retraining-a-method-to-reduce-alcohol-consumption/)

We have now combined our modified technique, imaginal retraining, with another behavioral technique, decoupling, which in numerous studies has shown efficacy in body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) such as trichotillomania and nail biting. Addiction and BFRBs have some symptomatic overlap but do not necessarily occur together. Because of this, we were uncertain whether the combination would have additive effects. In a recently completed study of 227 people with problematic alcohol use, we succeeded in reducing participants’ craving for alcohol by more than one third. We know that this sounds too good to be true. We therefore invite you to try the modified protocol at [www.uke.de/craving](https://www.uke.de/craving) that combines the two techniques. Before performing the new technique (called P3, which stands for pull, pause, push) please study the original manual, imaginal retraining, which you can also find at [www.uke.de/craving](https://www.uke.de/craving). This illustrates the theoretical background of the technique. **The technique is generic and can be easily adopted to food cravings.**

Your experiences with the combined technique are important to us. Please write to [moritz@uke.de](mailto:moritz@uke.de) or post a comment below. However, we suggest you test the method for yourself before jumping into the discussion",1644390439.0

I'm thinking about looking for professional help,2,smk7ll,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/smk7ll/im_thinking_about_looking_for_professional_help/,0,"Hi guys,

I don't know if I have DAE, it's just a suspect.

On Saturday morning I started to think about start a diet. Since then, I become extremely restrictive about food. For example, yesterday I didn't eat for more than 15 hours and when I ate, I just drink some water, eat a Banana and 2 sausage. Ok, at that moment I already felt nauseous and wanted to throw up, but I controlled myself not to throw up (as usual, because I hate throwing up).  The last time I remembered throwing up from overeating was when I was a kid (I'm 26 now, I was about 10 at the time).

About three hours later I had a dinner with some colleagues and there I ate a piece of meat and drank too much wine, I got very drunk and I abused alcohol without intending to abuse it (the strange thing is that I only drank three glasses).  Now I woke up at dawn with the vomit practically in my throat and with a very strong headache, but I'm holding back not to throw up.  I ate little and I'm feeling stuffed, disgusted by everything I ate yesterday.

Until 2021 I was a person whose weight changed extremely fast, I was always oscillating between 50kg and 60kg, but my average weight always was 55kg. I remember that before I started to take lithium, I was always oscillating between to binge and starving, but I always said to myself ""oh, no, get this shit out of your head! You don't have bulimia, after all I never vomit after a binge episode"". The problem is that I always wanna to throw up and feel sick after that!

In 2021 I went to a psychiatrist to seek help for non-food related issues (I didn't even consider this possible). I live in Brazil and the psychiatrist I gone was a very poor quality public sector professional (very negligent with his patients z or at least with me);  he gave me lithium to take and in the blood tests my thyroid was always normal.  For reasons I don't know I started eating compulsively without the restriction phases I had before because if I didn't eat I would feel sick due to lithium.  And then in this story I gained over 30kg in about 6 months (special thanks to the son of a bitch of the psychiatrist who neglected this radical change in my body and didn't realize I had eating problems, he just tried to label me bipolar and borderline because it's easier).

Anyways, after taking this shit called ""lithium"" for a few months, at least it helped me to stop starving or to binge... Until the last Saturday when I feel like I'm coming back to this fucking cycle :(

Guys, I can't take it anymore. I just can't. I was very obsessed about thinness... when I was 50kg I felt and treated myself like I was an obese, I felt fat! I had to gain 30kg to realize how thin I was and I'm very, very depressed because now I FUCKING HATE MY BODY LIKE I NEVER DID BEFORE. I think about to kill myself because I can't live in this body and I'm feeling desperate to recovery my thinness.

Now I wake up feeling sick I started to reflect about seeking for professional help. I really suspect that I have some eating disorder.

I've never had a good relationship with food and my body, and in 2021 I reached my lowest and heaviest weight I've ever had in my life.  It wasn't until months later that I reflected that this must not be normal and thought for the first time that I need to look for specialists in eating disorders (nutritionist and psychologist, maybe psychiatrist, but I'm too traumatized with psychiatrists to seek one).

Oh, and when I was a child, I was obese and suffered bullying because of it. I remember that I ate until I throw up and my grandma always forcing me ate (because for her excessive weight was a synonym of health).",1644218462.0

I've been sort of bulimic for seven years now (it was not as bad as now tho, just casually vomiting after a binge here and there, but at the time I didn't even think it was that serious, i knew nothing about beds). Since COVID hit I decided to lose some weight (went from 60 to 53 kgs)and I've been stuck in a binge-purge/restric-binge cycle. A couple of months ago I used to binge every single day and purge, it's gotten better after a while and I managed to not binge for quite some time but still restricted a lot (i have real bad body image issues, completely and utterly hate the way I look so I'm scared of gaining weight since I already feel naturally fat if this even makes sense). My mother has been supporting me and my recovery all this time and she always tells me that it's okay to relapse and give in sometimes, it won't ruin anything (she's not encouraging me to eat, she says those things after I've had a binge episode to make me feel less shitty). Today i probably did the worst thing ever. My father gave me some money to spend on clothes since I was quite sad about not having anything nice to wear for a birthday party (i don't like how clothes look on me) and i... Literally used some of it to go and buy binge food. I already felt guilty but then I fucking lost my wallet with all the money in it while coming back home ffs
When I called my mother I didn't tell her about the binge (it was fucking huge I would have scared her) i only told her i lost the wallet and started crying. I feel so goddamn guilty, if I used the money the right way and actually saved it instead of spending it I wouldn't be in this fucking situation and on top of that I couldn't resist due to guilt and stress and binged again.

While this was happening he was really stand offish, and seemed upset with me because of how I almost passed out. After noticing this I confronted him about it recently and he told me that he was upset with me because he knew I didn't eat that day, and he thought it was ""stupid"" of me to even do that since we were going to be walking around in hot weather. I then told him that I had an eating disorder, and that it runs deeper than me just ""not wanting to eat"".

I wasn't expecting him to know what to say or do to this confession, but I also don't want him to be upset at me for not eating. I get tired of hearing that from people.

My very warped brain thinks this is okay,8,slp8pa,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/slp8pa/my_very_warped_brain_thinks_this_is_okay/,1,"So I’ve been bulimic for 21 years (from the age of 14)

My weight has fluctuated up and down from lows of 47kgs right up to 112kgs over the years. I’m down to 88kgs and although I think my bulimia stems from a combination of weight loss, control issues, anxiety and the fact that I’m a foodie and love cooking, I don’t seem to know any other way of life. 

I have convinced myself that if I have a protein shake for breakfast with my vitamins and a small salad for lunch then that’s enough nutrition and those two meals I don’t purge. But then the rest of the evening I binge hectically and purge up to 8 times in a short space of time. I will hinge and purge continually for around 2-3 hours. My warped brain justifies that at least have had nutrition earlier on in the day.

I have a 2 year old daughter and I do not want to ever project this on her. My mother was a bulimic and I know that my issues with food stemmed from her constant dieting and telling me what I could and couldn’t eat. 

My husband has been very kind. I thought I had been very good at hiding it for years but he recently told me that he’s always known but not wanted to confront me for fear it would cause a trust issue between us.

To bulimics who try to recover,9,slhasr,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/slhasr/to_bulimics_who_try_to_recover/,0,"I want to give you some advice and tell you stuff that didn't work from my personal experience and tell you how I'm working on it right now

(1). Don't try to make the longest streaks you can , especially with cheap tricks like having no money with you when you go out, so you won't buy stuff or brushing your teeth, so you won't eat again later and basically just preventing the action of binging and purging, if the thought is in your head and you just don't do it you just use your mental strength and the days without the disorder feel restrictive as shit and 1 you might get the idea that you need the disorder to be happy or 2 you'll beat yourself up after ending a streak and end up binge eating and purging even more frequently than before thinking that you already messed up but in reality you just missed how it feels and the worst 3 you'll lose the motivation to recover cause every time you fail you will feel like it's impossible to recover a little bit more each time and end up just giving up and accepting it at the worst case ! 

(2). Don't try to recover while doing a crash diet at the same time, like seriously what are you thinking? It's counter productive to the core, is it really worth it to lose fat that quickly? Does it matter more than recovery ? Be honest with yourself and realistic 

What to actually do and what I'm I doing now !
I just try to do the cycle less frequently every time. That's really my goal so I don't feel like I fail all the time and it's more realistic for me as well, you really can't go from purging every day 2 times to not at all if you fail that kind of stuff blame yourself for having unrealistic expectations not for lack of will power and dedication. I eat lots of protein for satiety and fruit and vegetables mostly so I eat as much as I want and rarely have cravings for junk that way. Also I'm not afraid to put some more food after I finish my plate if I'm underestimating my appetite ! So doing it again sometime is expected really but I am slowly improving it !

I first started purging back in July, like- July 23d or 24th, somewhere in that time frame. I remember it destroying me because I knew that going down that path was gonna be worse then restricting to me. So I was in a constant binge / purge for months, August and September was at my worst but then getting sick broke that cycle because I fucked it up again, fun.

Again, my family knows i’m bulimic, my doctor told my mom I had bulimia and what did my mom do? absolutely fucking nothing, because she knows absolutely nothing about ads. and with her knowing that, she knows I purge, as does the sister I share a room with. Long story short been threatened with the cops if I didn’t stop purging, which what the fuck are they gonna do. My mom also thinks i’m purging because I want to get healthier, so she suggested I cut out sugar and exercise more. I’m- you don’t tell that to someone, especially your child who you know has an ed, god.

Tips for helping a friend with Bulemia,3,slkza6,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/slkza6/tips_for_helping_a_friend_with_bulemia/,0,"Recently, a friend of mine (F30) shared that she has post partum depression and bulemia. 
She's been binging and throwing up for the past few months after being influenced to do it by another friend of hers (they are no longer in contact, but the damage is done).

The past few months, I've noticed her become obsessed with her weight and what she eats, she would go days without eating after eating ""too much"" for one meal. I chose to not say much because I didn't want her to feel judged by me or become defensive, she eventuallu felt comfertable to open up and revealed that she binges and throws up, many times a day, for the past few months. she was not aware it was bulemia and what complications it could bring, she thought it was harmless and a good solution to her problem.

 I'm glad she felt comfortable sharing this with me, and I would like her to keep doing so. She's now started therapy as well. But, I sometimes don't know how to respond to her without making her feel worse or sounding judgmental. For example she shares when she's eaten and not thrown up after a meal and I'm super proud, but she does still have hard days when she does binge and throw up, and I tell her its ok to have falls. I also feel like maybe I should try and avoid conversations about food and try and take her mind off it because she tends to talk about it a lot (meaning talking about what she would eat or what she ate that day, or about her body and how it looks)

I just would never want to say something that would make it worse/hurt her/make her feel misunderstood or that sha can't be free to share whatever because I know how that feels with having depression, adhd and ptsd and binge eating myself.

So 20 days ago I decided I was going to stop drinking for at least a month. It’s been going pretty okay but I’ve noticed I’m just craving sugar/chocolate/sweets a lot and I find myself snacking more often. And it doesn’t even have to be sweet stuff. I just made my dog a batch of rice and I’m just eating the plain rice because it’s there. I’m not even hungry. 

I’d say I’m at a pretty decent place in recovery. I probably b/p 3x/year tops. Very once in a blue moon. Im good with intuitive eating most times and letting myself enjoy and allow the things I want. 

But yeah, all this snacking and stuff…it just makes me feel like “all or nothing”. Sometimes I feel like it can almost be a compulsion and so I tell myself “if I really wanted to, I could just eat what I want and not have to worry about it”.  

Idk it’s hard to explain. I have to be careful I’m not replacing one thing with the other.

My diagnosis is anorexia *binge eating/purging type* hence my posting in r/bulimia. It started in my mid-late teenage years as restricting type but always consisted of at least tiny binges, or comfort eating surrounded by restriction.

I think the comfort eating (now binges/purges) are the hardest for me to give up. I'm realizing I need to replace my rituals with something that gives me a similar feeling of relief. Otherwise recovery always feels impossible because my depression and anxiety is enough that I will be not suicidal, but also not life-affirming if that makes sense?

I have been dieting and failing since I was 10. I starve myself and diet for some time and then crash and eat anything and everything I find whether I’m hungry or not then I feel shame and start a different diet again. 

Around 14 I sorta got the idea that i could vomit to get rid of the food I binge so I started doing it and years later I’ve developed severe Gerd. Stomach acid literally comes back up to my mouth randomly through the day. 

When I told my doctor about what I do to get rid of food I binge, none of them mentioned EDs or therapy. Just that I should stop and properly diet. I think they don’t think it’s a big issue because I am obese.
I guess my question is if obese people can have Bulimia? Or EDs in general? Because all my life I still sorta believe I can’t have an ED cuz I’m fat (except maybe binge eating but even then I don’t feel like I’m allowed to say I have an ED as a fat person)",1643747575.0

I had always hated my body, ever since I was a little girl I was aware I was chubby and bigger than other girls and was always insecure about it. 
In 2021, around early July, I tried out bulimia after hearing more about it from tumblr, which, for reference- never go on there if you struggle with an eating disorder, it's filled with pro ana and pro mia people and you do not need that in your life, trust me. Anyways, I threw up every single day, and if I wasn't purging, I was restricting, and didn't allow myself to have more than 100 cals per day, and I kept that up for maybe 3 weeks, but in all, i kept up my general eating disorder for 6 months in full. 
Around early October, on a late Saturday morning I got a sudden terrible chest pain and I was struggling to breathe, and of course was rushed to the emergency room. They didn't really make many conclusions there but that I had gastritis. A month later, the same thing happened, but over the month before, I would be getting the same pain, but just not as intense. But that day, it was terrible, I was at school and I just couldn't breathe and I felt like I was going to just stop breathing and suffocate to death, I was honestly so scared. I ended up having to stay at the hospital and that same day, I got an ultrasound to check me out. Next day, when I was still at the hospital, they determined I had stones in my gallbladder and needed a cholesectomy (or however you spell it) to get rid of it. I had to get it done that day as well, so I went through the surgery and god after it was hell. I was in so much pain I felt so nauseous and weak and not to mention, hopeless. I dealt with surgery pain for days on end and it was terrible. Worst part was, my gallbladder wasn't the problem. 
Yes, I did have stones and I needed to get it removed, but that wasn't why I was getting those chest pain attacks, I still get them to this day after all. I was diagnosed with several diseases/conditions after my hospital stay. This includes Superior Mesenteric Artery syndrome (which I might have to get surgery for soon), Gastritis, Esophagitis, Cholecystitis, Hematemesis, Cholelithiasis, etc. 
And like I said, to this day, I still get these attacks. Because of my surgery and.. lack of a gallbladder, I can't have food that's greasy, fatty, sugary, or has a lot of caffeine, etc. And if I do, I get a terrible stomachache, like brutal, that lasts forever and makes you weak and nauseous, and the next day I get terrible chest pains + the lack of control over my breathing, which I cannot emphasize enough, is the worst thing ever and makes me feel like I'm going to drop dead. Not to mention, constant stomach aches. All the time, 24/7. It's a terrible way to live life and I wish I never even started, especially now because I really love my body, and not because its skinny, because I'm not skinny, I'm a little chubby and I love myself for how I look. But I still don't know what's wrong with my body and I still have to live day to day in this body that is constantly hurting. 
This doesn't happen to everyone, but it can happen to you. Don't let it. Overcome it, try your hardest. I really believe in you. Don't let this ruin your life like it did mine. And don't think it won't happen to you, you're not just losing weight, you're wasting away your life and damaging your body.

i always read posts on here about the amount of money spent on food delivery and/or groceries that are like MEANT for a binge (so things that you ahead of time or right before bingeing would get, common ""binge foods"" like ice cream, candy, etc) but i rarely EVER do that. i just end up bingeing on foods i buy for a regular day. it makes me feel like a shitty bulimic cause im not even enjoying the bingeing part. its just like, compulsive eating. isn't it part of the criteria for a diagnosis that you binge on calorie dense foods? sorry if this is stupid i just can't even begin to process WHY my brain is like mm yes lets binge on bran cookies

"I think I might be starting to become bulimic, but I’m not sure how bad my situation is",4,sgy0jt,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sgy0jt/i_think_i_might_be_starting_to_become_bulimic_but/,5,"Hi everyone, first time here.

I’m a university student (20, gay male) in the UK. I’m from Europe originally, but I’ve been here for a while now.

So, my relationship with food was almost never healthy. As a kid, I used to be overweight. People used to shame me and nag me for it, and as a teen I got lucky with my genes. My mother was very very thin when she was young, and as I grew up I became really thin too. I was underweight for most of my teens years. This isn’t because I particularly cared about the food I was eating or how often, it just naturally happened.

Not everyone is a teen forever though. At around age 18, I noticed myself putting on some weight slowly. This was good to some degree, as at that point people no longer shamed me for being overweight, but instead for being underweight. 

But now, people started to make comments again about me looking like I’ve put on some weight. This has been leaving me very upset and somewhat self conscious. In the gay community, people are extremely superficial when it comes to the way you look. I never particularly care about how others look, but I can’t help but feel like most people around me judge me.

I also have an issue with binge eating. When I am very tired or upset, I tend to order large amounts of fast food and just eat them all. I also usually feel guilty about this.

I decided about a week ago to put myself on a “healthy diet”. I am a person that cooks a lot, but a lot of my food includes animal fats and other things that aren’t particularly healthy. I decided to replace all of that with more healthy foods, such as avocado for example, and wholewheat carbs. I also started eating a bit less, and tried to only eat until I was full. I didn’t even notice I was doing it so often, but I started counting calories too. I also decided to pair this with exercise, and I’ve been doing a 20 minute routine every day since then.

I’m afraid I screwed up though. I think I might be eating too little, as I felt weak during almost the entire week. Besides this, what worries me the most is what happened yesterday.

I was home after a long day, so I decided to smoke some weed and relax. But at some point, I felt an urge to order food. I don’t quite know how to explain it, I was just really tired and craving fast food, it’s happened before. I ordered a large amount as usual, but I couldn’t bring myself to finish it. I felt so guilty, like I had just thrown away all of the progress I had made that week. And then the thought of throwing up crossed my mind. I could just do it this once and not have to worry about my diet. The only reason why I didn’t do it was because there was someone else in the house, and I didn’t want the to see me doing it.

I haven’t made myself throw up before aside from when I was too drunk and didn’t wanna be hungover in the morning. And this morning I woke up thinking maybe this is getting a bit out of control. Is there any advice you can give me? Is this something I should be worried about?",1643624218.0

Recovered Bulimic looking to lose weight without disordered behaviors,5,sf63ew,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sf63ew/recovered_bulimic_looking_to_lose_weight_without/,1,"  Hey y'all. I struggled with bulimia, binging and self induced vomiting for about 7 years, and in 2021 started to work on recovering. I have not had any binging or purging episodes in a while now. My first step was take purging off limits, even if I had over eaten. 

  For a few months, I continued overeating, though the binges were on a smaller scale, I would not purge at all and have put on more weight than I am comfortable with. I don't fit in a lot of my clothes, and I am unhappy with how I look and feel. I also love running, and my speed and endurance suffered from this weight gain. 

  Currently, I am at the higher end of the healthy BMI range, and would just like to get down to the lower end of the healthy range.

  I had gotten desperate many times during the height of my eating disorder, and I would try to water fast/ not eat for days, up to 12 days no food in attempts to get weight off. This would always lead to rebound binges, and subsequent purges (throwing up the binges). More recently, having worked on myself and gotten over my bulimia, I still felt desperate enough in the passed 3 months to lose weight and tried water fasting multiple times. These lead to small binges and days of overeating,  and consequently packing on more weight. I am not used to, or comfortable with myself at this weight and it is affecting my self esteem. 

  I would like to lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way so that my running can improve, and so I can fit in my clothes again. I just don't feel like myself when I look like this. 

 *Disclaimer*: By losing weight and fitting in old clothes, I don't mean fitting in my underweight/ sick clothes again, I just mean fitting in my intermediate clothes where I was slimmer, but still in the healthy bmi range. I also talked to my doctor and mental health team about doing this/ trying to lose some weight in a healthy way, and they said it shouldn't be a problem as long as disordered behaviors are not part of the plan, and I'm receiving follow ups with them during the process. 

  I can't trust my own judgment any more, because my mind immediately goes to the extreme option: do long water fasts to lose weight quickly. I'm now realizing water fasting is not sustainable, and I can't be consistently fasting from A to Z (from this higher weight to my goal). This is why I wanted some outside perspectives. 


  I'm looking for advice for how much of a calorie deficit I should aim for, that I can stick to *consistently* to lose some weight, without falling into binging, or any other disordered eating behaviors. And any other tips as far as fitness and diet goes. 

*I was about to try to embark on yet another water fast but stopped myself and came here for advice, realizing that I was about to launch myself into another cycle of binge eating and more weight gain.*

too much (TW),15,sepyh1,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sepyh1/too_much_tw/,2,"my stomach hurts. so much. at this point I can't tell if it's from being hungry or from the purging or from being too full even though it's technically empty. I'm worried I've actually damaged it at this point. my throat is the same way. its constantly dry and sore and I have a hard time swallowing. 

I've been dealing with this for 14 years and feel like it just doesn't end. the worst part is that I am so very painfully aware of it and keep telling myself I'll fix it but I never do. I feel like I can't. I eat and even when it's a small amount of food I can't handle it because at this point it's not even just my mind having the thought, my body immediately rejects it and I have to rush to the bathroom. It's even happening at work now. 

I never know what days I can hold down food or not. my teeth have yellowing and cavities, im iron deficient from never having any kind of nutrition. I'm relying on solely vitamins, juice and smoking most days. I can barely remember a day that food has sat completely well with me. It's like as soon as it's in my body wants it out. 
yesterday I went to dinner with my boyfriend and I got really drunk and was happy because I wasn't thinking about it but halfway home I felt so sick and the thoughts started. By the time I got home I ran to the bathroom and realized most of the food had already digested and the only thing that came up was stomach bile. It tasted disgusting but I couldn't stop because I needed it out. It hurt so much and I was crying from the pain and being upset because I didn't want to keep going but I couldn't stop. this has unfortunately happened much more than a few times. I feel terrible because a year and a half ago I told my boyfriend (26) that I had this condition and that I recovered and was only in fear of relapsing. I had been clean for a year at that point and was finally at a healthy weight and doing overall very well. he was supportive and held me while I cried and I was okay for a month. I told him I thought I was good but a week later there was something really bad that happened with family and I relapsed hard. I didn't tell him. I still haven't told him. he notices when I get sick but he just thinks it's a health issue and doesn't realize it's...this. I haven't had the heart to tell him and now he's worried there's something medically wrong with me and I'm writing this now after a night of being wide awake from guilt and sadness. 

I dont want to put this on him. but im wasting away and in so much pain. what if something in me is inherently broken? I'm in a heavy rotation of feeling empty and relying on sex to make me feel whole.
I barely have any ounce of true happiness. I feel as though anytime I recognize that I'm feeling positive that I'm not allowed to have it and revert back to this feeling even though I don't want to
and of course I'm too scared to tell anyone at all, not just him because I'm supposed to be in one of the happiest times of my life. I don't want to be ungrateful and I know that that's not what I'm being but you know. I want to just walk outside and keep walking until I dissappear you know? I don't know.

I just feel at this point it's too much. I was doing so well and going to the gym to counter it and it was working amazing but the pandemic closed everything and now I'm at the point where I've gained weight and its hard to work out and start all over again and am back to purging and feel too weak to even work out. I'm so tired from this. 

I just want it over. I'm sorry for the vent. I just needed to let this out. If you read this all, thank you. After 14 years I'm just so drained from this and from hiding it so I'm greatful for everyone's story thats been shared. It makes me feel at least slightly better that I'm not alone and that's the only thing I'm holding onto right now.

Since the beginning of the new year, I have only been consuming a warm beverage of powered multi-grains and water. So far, I feel great and don't have any need to chew something or desire to eat healthier. I don't worry about binge-eating or triggers.

In fact, I probably don't need a fridge--nothing is in there to help me avoid triggers.

Recovery is possible!! (My story),5,sehw5m,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sehw5m/recovery_is_possible_my_story/,2,"TW: calorie amounts, mentions of b/p and restricted disordered eating

It started when I was in 8th grade(13 years old.) I suddenly put on a TON of weight (the result of my mother drugging me…that’s a long story for another sub lol.) it was awful. I was very obese and was made fun of constantly by both friends and family. So I started starving myself..I ate 300-500 calories a day for 5-6 months. I ended up dropping a ton of weight and by the time I was a freshman, I was “pretty” again. I was fairly active with a kids metabolism so I could eat what I wanted and didn’t worry about weight too much. 


When I was a sophomore, my metabolism slowed down and I started gaining again. That’s when I started purging. I have zero gag reflex so I turned to laxatives and forcefully massaging my stomach/colon to expel food after a meal. I was 15 years old. 


Fast forward to my right before senior year of high school. I managed to maintain a “healthy” weight but no one knew that I was literally purging after every meal. I don’t even want to know how much money I spent on Dulcolax. Then I went to work at a juice bar….huge mistake. Free food was constantly available and I put on a TON of weight in less than 3 months. I started purging harder than ever and even managed to start throwing up. Despite that I still gained weight. 


Finally I realized I had to stop. I was miserable, and my joints were killing me at only 18 years old. I was super overweight, had no cardio strength and I had completely destroyed my GI tract. I reached my breaking point when I nearly collapsed on the short (<1 mile) walk home from work after a big binge on smoothies. I managed to make it home and was violently ill out of both ends for 2 hours. I honestly wondered if I was going to die. My last purge was sometime October 2021. My last binge was in December 2021. 


I moved up north to live with my dad and stepmom. I didn’t even look at the scale for awhile, then gradually got into the habit of weighing myself no more than once a week. I got a new (pretty physical) job and started working out. I ended up gradually losing all the weight I’d gained, went down to a healthy weight  and built muscle tone. I also have THE BEST weights trainer who doesn’t put as much importance on how much you weigh but rather on if you’re healthy and can lift with good form. (Thanks Coach H!!!) 


lm now turning 19 and still live with the side effects of my previous bad choices, I have pretty gnarly IBS and have to be very careful with spicy food (which sucks lol because spicy food is the best 😩) but I’m very lucky I didn’t do more damage to my gut and I didn’t hurt my teeth. 


I’m at a very healthy weight which I monitor but don’t obsess over. If I’m up one week, I make sure and exercise a bit more and cut back on the sweets the next week. If I’m down one week, I make sure to drink a couple extra protein shakes. Basically, I eat when I’m hungry and if I’m not hungry I wait til I am. I don’t remember the last time I body checked. 

Recovery IS possible!! I fought disordered eating and bulimia for six nasty years and was pretty fortunate to make it out alive.Please don’t hurt your body for the sake of looking “pretty”. I can promise you it’s not worth it.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety my whole life and with anxiety comes a certain amount of paranoia around the “what ifs”.

Long story short, every time I purge a little hard or whatever, I feel dizzy. Dizziness begins feeling like brain fog and a bit of mental and physical fatigue, and I immediately fall into the “what if I puke too hard and cause an aneurism…what if I have a brain tumour…what if the years of B/P causes throat cancer…” etc etc and I basically spiral. I realize I’m also generally anemic and not in the greatest shape but in these moments, all reasoning goes out the window and still, no amount of paranoia around my health has stopped my B/P completely.

I don’t think there’s recovery for me,10,sc13ao,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/sc13ao/i_dont_think_theres_recovery_for_me/,0,"Allow me to explain. I have been battling disordered eating patterns since 2019 after a traumatic experience in 2018. 

I restricted for a whole year, lost xxlbs, the pandemic came, binged for a whole year and I gained that back and then some, so as you see, I have a cycle. The only issues is I am obese, have been obese my entire life and even when I lost xx lbs, I was still obese. I spent 2021 trying to give my body a break, binged more than anything seldom restricted because I REALLY was trying to let my mental have a break from caloric obsession and hating my body. 

I love my body. My body dysmorphia is getting better, and I see myself for what I am. But, last Sunday, I purged for the first time, and it felt so euphoric that it scared me. After that I absolutely knew that my restriction switch got flipped and here I am … restricting. But mostly eating how I want than excessively exercising to be in a deficit. 

I say all this just to vent, because now that I’m started again w my restrictive part of the cycle until I lose xx lbs again, I won’t be happy. I feel like I will never get out of this cycle though. There’s no room for recovery for me because honestly I don’t know how to lose weight without restricting. I would say that I hope I find a healthy relationship w food, but at this point it just seems like wishful thinking. I have no control.

I gained a little weight this past month because I was trying to recover (I relapsed since last week though 😶). And the way I see it, getting my period back means that I'm supposed to be healthy now. So the fact that I ate like crazy and didn't purge after, and the fact that I gained all this weight, means I'm supposed to be normal again. I feel like this is my body telling me that this is actually my healthy weight. And it disgusts me. I can't accept that. No way. I hate being at this weight. I hate how I look, I hate how I feel, I hate the number. I feel like everything I've done has been for nothing.

I've been struggling with this to various degrees for 12 years and while it's really validating to get a diagnosis, I'm nervous about the treatment program I am about to enter into. For context, I have a long history of trauma and I am very very nervous around mental health professionals given that I have experienced psychiatric abuse. I have a trauma therapist that I have been working with for three years and she's my lifeline. She's the first therapist to take my trauma seriously and has compassion for my unhealthy behaviours. She's flexible in her approach and treats me like a human being, but she has no experience treating EDs. The psychiatrist I recently met, who runs the eating disorders program, seems to be the opposite of that. She was very cold towards me and was very strict and serious. She explained all of the things that I will be doing and all the people I will see, including her, a therapist, a dietician, and an RN, and that I will need to ""put in the work"" (which I'll obviously do... that's why I'm here). While I am very grateful to be getting help and am excited to change my relationship with food/my body, I'm worried that the program might not be compassionate enough for me and that I might be re-traumatized. I know it takes hard work, but these people just don't seem to be interested in getting to know me and they don't seem trauma-informed.

I can do it but slower than I thought ! That's a long story short though, now for the details

For some days I did not binge neither purge but today I ate a small amount of sweets the home had and the idea to buy binge food and bought it with a poor excuse, finding 5 € down the road if you are curious, and had thoughts that I wasn't really really hungry but went after it anyway and runned to the supermarket happy as fuck like bad old days and got something like nuttela but cheaper granola milk a huge croissant bigger than my head and biscuits like a box with 0,5 kgs of it (1,1 pounds) 

As I was eating I felt satiety but I continued eating until I finished one box of cereal but trust me I didn't eat until I was stuffed but I felt that I want way more food now than before cause I fucked everything for months and yeah I did purge and very successfuly as well I almost spill water flushing the water for the first time ever and remember I wasn't even stuffed so yeah I subconsciously eat more to feel satiety ! I'm like I'm doing eating challenge exercise if you think about it 

But feeling satiety eating like that felt weird someday I'll probably stop but purging so successfully makes it very hard and there is leftover in my house ! One day I had the question what is the worst Ed someone could have ? Well it always depends on the person and how it reacts to the disorder ! I felt like complete and utter shit being close to underweight ! It was not addicting at all , pure binging made me want to vomit cause I couldn't sleep and bulimia ... Only long term side effects and health issues are problematic, but I care about that as much as smokers care for long term side effects Wich is ""not enough to want to change"" so yeah addictions mess everything up suddenly are the worst in my opinion

I (25f) am 6 years into recovery from bulimia. I proudly consider myself 99% recovered. Here's what worked for me...,39,s8n56n,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s8n56n/i_25f_am_6_years_into_recovery_from_bulimia_i/,2,"I'm sharing a piece of my story to offer support, guidance, or just an ear to vent to for people who are feeling hopeless, helpless, alone, or just generally struggling in any way.

I was diagnosed bulimic, although my behaviors leaned toward anorexia binge/purge type as I would restrict for days, leading to a ravenous binge, and then purge and go back to restricting again.

In my opinion, I don't think that eating disorders can be 100% cured. I still have thoughts and urges here and there but I'm able to easily wave them off. I haven't engaged in eating disordered behaviors in nearly 4 years. I no longer associate food with feelings of guilt or shame. My relationship with food is normal again. 

When I went into recovery at age 19 it was a combination of DBT therapy, eating disorder specific treatment (Renfrew partial) and my own blood, sweat, tears, determination, and commitment to not wanting to be sick anymore that led me to success in recovery. 

A crucial part of my recovery was learning to separate my ED self from my normal self. It helped me to refer to my ED voice as a separate entity, like an actual bully in my head. Once I was able to do that I could pick apart my healthy thoughts from my sick thoughts. I reminded myself it wasn't ME who thought I was worthless, disgusting, unloved etc. It was my eating disorder and it wanted to kill me. 

I was taught in therapy that we are not born negative by default. We essentially train our brains based off life experiences, trauma, general thoughts, etc. Our brain wires itself accordingly based off our perception of what's going on around us, how we see ourselves. If we are constantly putting ourselves down, thinking negative thoughts on repeat, always beating ourselves up, your brain will train itself to resort to negative thinking by default. And the more we tell ourselves we aren't good enough, the more toxic our thoughts become, the more negative our brain processes information, until we convince ourselves that we really aren't good enough. That being said, if you can train your brain to be primarily negative, you can certainly retrain it to have a much more positive mindset, simply by using the same method originally used that trained our brains to resort to a negative, cynical, self-destructive mindset by default. If you put in a conscious effort to revamp your mindset, discredit negative thoughts, be kind to yourself, over time your brain will retrain itself to process information in a positive way. The more you often you are kind to yourself, the more you will begin to believe it and be able to tune out negative thoughts.

With that being said, this is not an overnight fix. It takes time, conscious effort and practice. I regularly  corrected or dismissed any negative, critical or just plain cruel thoughts I had about myself, or reworded them to be more positive. It helped me to say, out loud, ""No, that's not true. I'm not worthless."" Hearing myself say it was more effective than just thinking it. 

I learned intuitive eating. Full disclosure, my experience with learning how to eat intuitively is based off a bulimic perspective. I realize anorexia may have other, more effective approaches specific to anorexics that are better suited to help them relearn how to eat and how to eat intuitively, given that bulimics and anorexics exhibit different disordered eating patterns and have different needs. In the case of my own bulimia, had become so accustomed to rapid binging and then purging that my body's hunger signals were out of whack. I practiced pacing myself while eating, listening to my body's cues, and stopping when I was content, not full. Again, this takes time and conscious effort to learn. Eventually your body and brain adjust and it comes naturally. 

If you have access to DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy), seize the opportunity. It saved my life. It's different from CBT therapy, there's less talking out your issues and more learning to identify and reform  negative, toxic, or destructive behaviors and replace them with healthier coping skills, and regularly practicing those skills until they become second nature; mindfulness and ""living in the moment""; and learning emotional regulation skills to be put in place when faced with particularly intense emotions. For me, DBT was a godsend. I binged and purged largely because I was upset or angry and it was a way for me to release my emotional stress. DBT helped me learn to sit with my feelings, ""ride out the wave"", and find healthier ways of coping with overwhelming emotions. Seriously, I think DBT should be taught as a class in high schools.

If you have insurance get yourself into an eating disorder program. They will hold you accountable, monitor your physical health, and give you the tools to overcome your eating disorder. It's helpful to have other people around you that understand what you're going through. Remind yourself not to become competitive with anyone and know that it's possible they may be competitive with you but to just ignore it if they are. Avoid comparing yourself to other patients. Everyone's story is different, everyone has suffered in their own way, and no two bodies are alike. That mindset is, unfortunately, an all-too-common part of irrational thinking that manifests as a result of getting stuck in a sick, eating disordered state of mind. It doesn't matter how sick or not sick you perceive yourself to be. Your ED will always come up with excuses to convince you you're not ""sick enough"" or ""not thin enough"" to need help. Your ED will never allow you to a reach a point where you are finally ""sick enough"" to deserve help. No matter what you do, nothing will ever be enough to satisfy your eating disorder. Remember that it's a relentless, ruthless, destructive disease that will not stop until it kills you, or you choose recovery. 

If you don't have insurance, there are eating disorder meetings that function similarly to AA/NA meetings that are free and open to anyone. They can be specific to bulimia, anorexia, binge eating, or include all types of eating disorders. There are also all-womens and all-mens groups available, as well as coed groups. ED specific self-help books are widely available at most bookstores and/or can be ordered online. You can also purchase DBT skills and activities books that you can work through at your own pace if you lack the resources or are otherwise unable to attend an in-person DBT group. 

Stop weighing yourself. Completely. Seriously. Throw out your scale. Unless you have a medical reason you need to monitor your weight, just don't do it. I stopped weighing myself years ago. Nothing good will come out of keeping track of your weight just because. If you take your recovery seriously and give your body time to heal and return to normal, it will eventually settle at its natural weight and shouldn't fluctuate drastically. 

Don't cut out whole food groups. Don't create a list of ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" foods. Resist the urge to look at nutritional labels and you'll eventually forget the amount of calories in them. Everything is okay in moderation. It's as simple as calories in, calories out. That's it. In our eating disorders we convince ourselves it's far more complicated and detrimental than it actually is. 

A few tips for physical health, take multivitamins daily to compensate for the nutrients you've been lacking, whether you're in recovery or not. Folic acid is good for your heart health and important if you eventually want to get pregnant. B vitamins are essential for numerous bodily functions. Lack of B1 can lead to brain damage down the line, while lack of B12 can potentially inhibit your motor functions, including your ability to walk, if your body is deficient in it over an extended period of time. Take supplements for your bones, especially if you're primarily anorexic, to avoid developing weak, brittle bones. Chia seeds help get your digestive system back on track if its been damaged or stalled due to your eating disorder. They were a lifeline for me in recovery. You can put them in shakes, smoothies, salads, really any food you want. 

Remember that recovery is always an option. We do recover. I'm living proof you can take your life back. No matter how far down the rabbit hole you are, recovery is always always always possible.

I weight train 5/6 days a week and it slowly started becoming and obsession back in 2020.  I lost weight and now I am absolutely terrified of ever gaining weight back on, TERRIFIED.  

My bulimia started in August this year but with only one purge episode after I ate 4 doughnuts in one go, after which I felt so guilty about.  I can eat my healthy protein meals throughout the day as I have to with being a weight trainer, but it’s like my brain won’t physically allow myself to enjoy any other foods i.e chocolate, sweets, etc.. and if I do slip up and eat them or binge on them I NEED to purge, and with that other meals end up coming up too. 

I thought to myself back in August when I first purged that I would never do that to myself again.  Now here we are months down the line and it’s becoming more and more frequent.  This last week has been the worst ever.  I am really starting to feel the physical effects on my body and I am sooooo tired all of the time now.  I constantly feel unwell and even lost my voice a few times due to having a sore throat from purging, and I don’t even have the energy to go to the gym - and I was always a creature of habit.

I'm very aware of how bad this is, but I'm having such a hard time with my self control (or lack thereof).

I've also noticed that my B/P is much worse when I order takeout, which is way more readily available today than it once was. I know all of the above to be true, and to be an issue for me, and yet I'm still struggling to stop this process.

I decided to have a bit of a cheat day, and eat a whole bunch of goldfish because HOLY CRAP GOLDFISH ARE DELICIOUS. Anyways, i told my dad that I wasn’t hungry because of the goldfish I had eaten, and he began to scold me on how unhealthy I was being, and rambling on and on about how eating bad foods like goldfish would make me fat. 

Him, the man that eats cookies, twinkies, and a dozen other diabetes-inducing foods, making fun of me, the health addict. He claimed that he was healthier than I was because he eats a banana before he devours chocolate cakes and whatever else, as if that made all the difference in the world. 

Basically, he made it fucking clear that I’m not allowed to occasionally eat relatively unhealthy foods, even after months of eating like a rabbit, because it would make me fat. How hypocritical. 

Thanks, dad, for nearly causing me to relapse. 

Over fucking *goldfish*.

Now, hidden in my room, I’m so immersed in the guilt that came as a result of the goldfish I ate that I can’t bring myself to eat anything else (goldfish was all I ate today).

Eventually my gf opened up to me and told me what it was, how it affects her, how long she has been struggling with this, etc. I want to help her recover.

She has been suffering from binge eating/purging for a year or two, but she is getting better. She used to B/P roughly 3-4 times a week, but now it is becoming once every other week, or so. I have found that she cares a lot about her own body image, which I assumed because of sticky notes describing her ""ideal body weight"" on a wall in her room, as well as a drawing of her ideal body, etc. I have done quite a bit of research on this, and have tried my best to help, but since I can't be with her 24 hours a day, how else can I help?

She has told me how she sets 'calorie limits' in her head, and if she goes over them during the day, she decides to purge. When I am with her (which is a few times a week) I ensure that she is not going over her calorie limit, so that she does not have to purge. Is this the right solution? Should I be promoting the limits, or should I try to get her to eat whatever she wants and make her not purge? She is not open to therapy/medication, since some of her close friends have had major side effects towards the medication, and she does not want to discuss with a therapist. She weighed herself for the first time in a few months, and based on how she reacted to the results, I am worried that this will make her situation worse.

Sorry if this sounds stupid, I do not personally struggle with this so I have not encountered these experiences before. Please let me know, thank you.",1642477849.0

My bulimia was worsened by a heartbreak,3,s60txd,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s60txd/my_bulimia_was_worsened_by_a_heartbreak/,0,"Ever since I was little, I’ve been treated very poorly. I was never good enough for my family. At school, I was bullied for my introverted personality, and people always left me for more popular classmates. I don’t have very many friends, and I want to have a social life, but I hate the idea of sacrificing my free time for other people. 

Senior year of high school, my best friend spread rumors about me and turned most of my classmates against me. I began to think about suicide, and how things would be so much easier for me if I were dead. I also wanted the world to know that it was my best friend’s fault for my death, and my blood was on her hands. 

Summer before sophomore year of college, I went on vacation and I met a guy. He seemed really cool, and I liked him a lot. We met a bunch of people on the trip, and another guy was hitting on me. He got upset with the other guy and told him that he liked me. When I found out, I asked him straight up (totally out of character for me). Turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. He cut off all contact with me. I was devastated. 

On one hand, I still wanted to marry and have kids with him. On the other, I wanted to commit suicide. Not to scare him back. No, that wouldn’t work. But actually die, and make sure that he was the last straw. I wanted to be a folk hero. The martyr that people told stories about to their children and grandchildren. I wanted the world to hate him. I also think that if I ever have children, I’ll keep secret tabs on him so if he had a child, my child and his would fall in love, and the truth about his emotional affair will come out. I even developed bulimia. Not because I feel overweight, but because I want him to know how badly he screwed me up",1642414831.0
So…,5,s5v5m3,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s5v5m3/so/,1,"I’m bulimic. A huge duh to you reading right now (bc like aren’t we all on this channel?) but a giant step for my kind because I’ve never admitted that out loud. It started in high school, grade 11 to be precise. I was never extremely overweight in life, but, I did get a bit too much on the curvy side in grade 10. But I didn’t care, my relationship with food was perfectly fine. My mom was very concerned with my looks since I can remember. But to be honest I don’t blame her for my eating disorder, not completely either. I know she has the best of intentions, but they don’t always translate well into her actions and words. Plus, what I’ve come to find out is that, no matter what my mom tells me, until I decide on it, or believe it myself, it won’t matter to me. Like people could call me this or that whenever wherever, but until I actually see myself as what they’re calling me, I won’t care. In grade 9 and 10 I didn’t care. Even though since grade 8 my mom was hauling me basically during every meal time about how much food I was munching on or how my dress size was going up. I just didn’t care. But then boys entered the chat, literarily and figuratively in grade 10. I started to care about my body image, I started to look to social media and magazines for what the ideal body type was. *Insert horror movie scream. And I started comparing myself to my skinny friends and before I even realized it, my waist was all of a sudden not small enough. My thighs were touching, I didn’t have the gap. My arms were too wide, and all that fun jazz. Now on top of all of this. Towards the end of grade 10, suddenly came talk of what courses we should take in grade 11, because suddenly grades matter. Suddenly we needed to know exactly what universities we wanted to apply to. Suddenly we needed to know exactly what we wanted to be in the future. Jesus even typing that I’m getting anxious. Worst thing about it was that my best friend at the time (notice how I said at the time, LOL lots of drama there for another time if you wanna open that can of worms) her sister was in university. She would belittle the frig out of our stress. We would be having an existential crisis about what courses to take in grade 11, and she’d say, you think this is stressful, wait till you get to university, this is nothing. Nothing. N O T H I N G. Ain’t that a big bowl of air. I find that to be the rudest thing a person can do. Belittle your struggles because there is always worse. Now, it doesn’t matter that she was right (*major eye roll I know). Friggin, as a first year master’s student juggling 3 jobs, the stress I felt in high school was a little wave washing on the shore compared to the tsunami of a life I surf on now. But here is the thing. Whatever that was bothering me, may not have been even near the absolute worse thing in her life, but it was in mine. We all experience and feel the world through our own eyes. It’s very hard, near impossible, to have the full human experience from someone else’s story or recap. So when you tell me there is something worse than what Im dealing with now, first off, excuse me how is that helpful? That’s equivalent to the paramedic saying, quit crying about your finger being cut off, the French used the guillotine to cut off people’s heads. Yours is still very much attached. Like… bruh. I digress. The point I meant to make here is that, grade 10, was a turning point. It was the fire that ignited everything that came crashing and burning in grade 11. The culmination of me suddenly not being okay with my body, and the stress of school cracking down set the stage for a perfect escape in the form of bulimia in grade 11. Now this is getting too long, but my God I have so much more to share. If you’ve read this far, on whatever device you’ve read this on, god bless your eyeballs. This is my first time on Reddit, and I joined it strictly to share on this channel. I don’t know anyone in my life who struggles with food, just me, myself, and I. And apparently miss bulimia thrives in solitude. So I thought to myself, since nothing else I’m doing is working, I think I should find my people and just talk it through. Hence the giddy and overly zealous typing on my phone that turned into this giant jumble of thoughts. I think what I wanna do is, share more to anyone out there who is struggling. I’ve been binging on my own thoughts for way too long, I think it’s time I purge it out. Too soon? 0_0 Yeesh tough audience. I kid a lot, don’t take me seriously because I rarely do.  But um, to anyone who is a fellow struggler, who has recovered, relapsed, or here for someone else, and willing to listen. I look forward to sharing. I want a change, it’s a new year… although arguably its 2020 too the way Covid is making comebacks left and right. But I wanna be better. I wanna do better, and I wanna help others and if sharing my experience and journey to hopefully recovery helps someone else do that then hey, hallelujah. For now I’m gonna leave it here :)",1642394474.0

"ED 2.0, 11 years and counting.",12,s5esqb,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s5esqb/ed_20_11_years_and_counting/,4,"Hello, 
I’m in my late twenties and during the last two years I’ve gained a little over fifty pounds. My story starts when I got pregnant in high school with my daughter. I had terrible nausea/morning sickness and threw up for the entirety of my pregnancy. After my pregnancy I decided to keep throwing up…I threw up almost everyday for about 11 years. My boyfriend (now husband) and I have been together for about 8 years, five of which we were long distance. During the pandemic, he moved in with me. Because he was there all the time, I stopped throwing up. Living in a small apartment it would of been impossible to hide so I stopped. And I was really proud. Unfortunately, we leaned a little too hard into the fast food arena and we drank way too much wine. As a result, I’m 50 pounds heavier, going from a 00 to a 6/8. It was the first time in my life that I felt at peace with my weight and free of my eating disorder. You might think wow, this is great! What a great success story. Maybe if we stopped there. But unfortunately it’s not, my husband is very vocal about my weight gain. And now I find myself slipping into old habits. I recently shared with him my story and my struggle with food. This was really hard because I’ve never told anyone and it was so habitual that I normalized it for more than a decade. Anyway, his aggressive approach is destroying me. I find myself hating myself, hating more than just my body but my entire being. I feel like I’m in this losing battle, even if I lose the weight I feel like I’m already so angry with him for making me feel like the numbers on the scale define me. I felt like I was finally overcoming my ED and now I’m in a worse place than before. It’s like ED 2.0 for me, even been toying with multi day fasting! Just wanted to ask for advice. I feel like I’m spiraling out of control and I’m really sad about my regression. I know a lot of you might say I should leave my husband, I’m not doing that. But I would love advice on how to breakthrough to a partner that doesn’t seem to get it, on how to communicate with someone like me about my weight.",1642348858.0

He left three younger siblings behind.

His death is getting to me more than I’d like to admit and I want to recover, but I don’t think my current therapy sessions are enough. 

My therapist recommends that I go through with inpatient ed treatment, but it’s an hour away from home and incredibly expensive. $1500 dollars a day for inpatient, and the place I’d be treated at doesn’t even take my insurance.

YOU DONT have it"" etc. So it's probably just severe thrush and it affected my boyfriend and Gabe him a rash. But damn it's uncomfortable. I think it was his laundry powder that set my body off.~~

Recovery day 13 🕺🏻,3,s53fia,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s53fia/recovery_day_13/,1,"A BIG BREAK-THROUGH DAY! 

OKAY! So! A huge burden throughout my recovery so far has been my blood sugar (genetic hypoglycaemia - carbs make me crash/shake and are a huge trigger for my b/p sessions) 

I’ve been trying to manage by balancing my carbs with lots of protein and fat. My carbs have been low enough to be low but not low enough for say, keto (so I’ve still been experiencing crashes). However, they’ve been low enough for me to lose a lot of water and feel really weak and thirsty. I’d been trying to increase electrolytes, but it’s hard to find electrolyte supplements with enough potassium (as veteran bulimics will know).

Anyhow, I was reading more into keto as a way to manage my blood sugars and read about the importance of electrolytes on the keto diet. I then read a DIY recipe for ‘keto-aid’ which includes CREAM OF TARTAR (extremely high in POTASSIUM!). Today I went out and got cream of tartar and magnesium to add to my electrolytes & OH MY GOD. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

I would’ve already been low in potassium having been a bulimic for over 10 years. A low carb diet would’ve only been exasperating that. 

I intend to go keto and continue supplementing with cream of tartar :-))

Key takeaways/ important notes:
- I have hypoglycaemia so a no carb diet is only beneficial to me in this circumstance - I don’t recommend it for anyone else. I have nothing against carbs (fucking love them - they just make me feel horrendous and sadly encourage my bulimia through messing with my blood sugars)
- CREAM OF TARTAR may be helpful for some in recovery/ as a harm reduction focused way to replace potassium (it’s impossible to find adequate potassium supplements out there that aren’t $$$$$). Please make sure you’re careful with dosages and balancing all electrolytes.

Feeling good and recovery is so worth it. Find the reasons that you’re being held back and don’t give up trying to solve them.

Recovery Day 12 🌼🌈🌸,25,s4g5wx,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s4g5wx/recovery_day_12/,0,"Thank god I didn’t give in yesterday. What a difference a day can make. 0 urges today! My blood sugar was still tricky to manage but I survived the day 😌 

I went for a long walk in the sun and could actually appreciate the wild flowers growing along the path because I wasn’t thinking about food or weight 😭🌷 

I’m eating more than normal but that’s okay. 

Only one important takeaway from today:

- Being stable and consistent is really hard…because it’s really fucking simple, and at its core, easy. Making things complicated and hard for myself has been a massive distraction from my own growth. While not the full picture, weight, bulimia, my looks, have been major distractions from feeling, and looking deeper into what it means to be me, to be human.

4th year of Bulimia,2,s49u9y,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s49u9y/4th_year_of_bulimia/,2,"Everything started when I was at my highest weight of 72 kg. I become anorexic, didn't eat anything, just drink coffee and water, and sometimes had one orange in the morning. 

I lost weight fast in 2 months I had 51 kg. I started going to the gym to not gain weight, which I just lost. But I also started eating and no matter my gym, I was doing workouts as crazy for full of 2 hours, I still gain weight. Just like 1-2 kg if I had 2 “big meals” (for me it's in the morning 2 eggs and lunch was a sandwich) and then my bulimia started, purging. 

I still went to the gym, but I had a normal breakfast without purging, and usually, I will not eat lunch at the work, I will go to the gym after my work and when I come home I will eat and purge. And I was purging daily. And it was normal for me. Sometimes I would eat at work, but I was making sure to drink laxative tea called Sena. When I couldn't drink it anymore, since it was disgusting I could sometimes purge at work in the bathroom, which was bad. My coworkers could hear me and I would say I was sick, etc. And at the time I was happy.

I went to the gym for full 1.5 years. And I had more projects for different jobs, started my own business, and so on. But still purging, but not going to the gym. Since I started working for almost 24 hours which I still do work like that and sleep just for 3-4 hours a day. 

I didn't have a period for 7 months, but when I started eating and purging, drinking natural tea my period came back. Good thing.

And when my period came back, every time before my period I would eat like crazy, off will try my best to purge all of it. But at the time it started being hard to purge.

I started taking 3,5,7 Dulcolax every day after purging.

Then one day I said okay my period will start probably tomorrow or the day after it, I will eat whatever I want, I will not purge. But next day I will purge whatever I eat, and I will lose that gained weight.

The problem started, I will try my best to purge all of it, but not everything will cane out, which freaks me out. Take daily Dulcolax.

Trying to drink coca-cola, sparkling water, salty water to purge sometimes works and will urge all of it sometimes not. But usually not all of it.

Now for one month, I am having 52-53 kg depending on the day.

I am having serve depression and anxiety. My lowest weight was in the summer 49 kg since I had really bad depression and didn't eat because of how bad I was.

I am sad because I am having scars on my hand of purging, stressed when I can't purge all of it, I can't go back to mine 51 keg.

I don't know what to do anymore, wants to die. I am feeling healthy, not having any problems, I think with my body and functions. But I can't take it anymore. If I will not purge what I eat in a day I will gain weight, and I don't want it. I want to be skinny forever.

She'd talk about being a certain small size walking out of the hospital after giving birth to me (her 3rd kid).  If we were in public she always pointed at some woman and asked if she was bigger than her.  She was obsessed with her size.  I grew up thinking something was wrong with me because I wasn't as small as she had been.  I was disgusted with myself for how ""big"" I was even though when I found out I was pregnant with my eldest I was only 100 lbs and 3 months along.  
Now as an adult, my mom tells me I focus too much on my weight, that I look sickly skinny. I need to gain weight and be happy with myself.

I wish I could say today was easy. It wasn’t. It was fucking hard. I had problems balancing my blood sugars all day and felt horrific. I’m struggling to get my meal timings right and overeating. BUT physically I’m looking so much healthier and overall I’m feeling better so I refuse to succumb to this disease. 

I’m currently in my PJs watching New Amsterdam waiting for my blood sugar to rise 🩸The old me would’ve binged - so while I feel awful, the feeling of pride outweighs it. 

Takeaways from today:
- Work is so much easier when I am stable and not engaging in b/p behaviours. B/ping caused me so much subconscious stress. 
- It’s so empowering to trust yourself. 
- The intense emotions I felt during my first week are subsiding. Letting myself feel has been vital.
- I need to better space my meals out. I don’t eat enough during the afternoon and then too much at night. 
- Im still loving having money!!! Spoiling myself with good healthy food, and enough of it feels great. Long term visions.
- I think I’ve been scared of my own success and holding myself back with bulimia. It was like a safety mechanism I could hide in to escape the discomfort of growth. 

If anyone has any hobby suggestions that feel really good, please let me know - trying to fill up the time I would usually b/p positively🥰

Today I’m 85 days free from bulimia. I’ve been bulimic for 11 years of my life. I don’t feel happy, or “free”, or anything or the sort. I feel miserable and lost. These 85 days have been absolutely terrible for me. 

I’m a new mom of a 5 month old baby, which is the reason why I wanted to stop purging. But for some reason, not a day goes by where I don’t want to relapse. My baby doesn’t know what’s going on, so why don’t I just continue doing it? 

When I’m binging and purging, I genuinely feel so happy. I feel euphoric and like this is the *one* thing I can control in my life. The weight loss is just a positive side effect. I want to relapse so bad. I want to do it today. I don’t care anymore. When I was actively b/p, I was still a great mom - a better one even. I felt way happier. Now, since being sober, I cry daily, I feel suicidal, I feel alone. My eating disorder was my only friend and now I don’t even have that.

I’ve been trying to deal with my depression, anxiety and bulimia, by addressing things that hurt me and changed me. My mother is one of the person that has hurt me the most in my life. She was physically, verbally and emotionally abusive with my family. 
She came with a fake “lets figure it out” that was basically her just gaslighting me into believing it wasn’t that bad or that I was accusing her of being a horrible mother. 

She hurt me deeply and I keep trying to have a relationship with her, but she keeps showing her true self. I cant keep walking on egg shells around her so I decided to cut her off.

Basically I celebrated Christmas early at my mom's house because we were both working on actual Christmas. I was binging without the intent of purging, but I never got to the point where I was uncomfortably/painfully full (not because I had self control or anything - my stomach was just a bottomless pit that day). All the food around was legitimately good, so I wasn't just stuffing my face with mediocre food. When the day was over I didn't even feel that guilty, even though I had eaten a ridiculous amount of calories, when in the past I'd thrown myself into a breakdown/panic attack over far less calories.

I was almost morbidly obese in 2019 and lost about 100 lbs in 2020. My diet was good, considering nutrients, eating reasonable amounts, and making sure to allow myself to indulge every once in a while. I was trying to establish a new way of eating for my life. But old habits die hard.

Around the end of the year, I was struggling with my mood because the loss of weight was effecting the efficacy of one of my medications. So I went back to old faithful and ate...gained about 20 lbs in a few months. So my weight loss caused my mood issues and I treated my mood issues with food, thereby gaining weight. The irony is not lost on me. 

I wanted to lose the weight once I adjusted my meds and started feeling better...but I got too caught up in the challenge and restricted myself too much. I ""messed up"" by eating two pieces of my favorite pizza that I was trying hard to resist. But hey, I know what I can do...

And that's where it started. It was just too easy and my weight was dropping fast. Even though I knew it was a problem and it was hurting my body, my lizard brain was overjoyed at this genius hack. Food was old reliable for feeling better and purging was now the new reliable to not have to pay for it (at least not in the currency of fat cells).

I've dealt with a mood disorder since I was 10 and after 25 years, I feel like I kind of have a grip on it and can make healthy decisions but omfg this is a different beast. I absolutely don't understand it. 

I sought out help pretty quickly. My therapist was a doctor and an ED specialist. I found it interesting that her talking about how I could go about eating in a reasonable way made me feel the same way as when my mom would give me advice on dieting (that's a smoking gun). My brain just goes numb. 

She was pretty concerned and suggested inpatient but I got my vitals tested and everything was normal, so she suggested a month long out patient intensive treatment...basically ""here's how to stop this crap"" school. I want to do it ...but a month is a long time and I'm the breadwinner of my household. I am looking into it and trying to plan for it because this shit just keeps getting worse and I don't foresee myself just stopping. 

But anyway, that's my story. I wanted to know if there was anyone here that started weight loss related eating disorder habits later in life as in 30 or older (with wiggle room if you'd like to contribute). It seems to be a young person issue, or an issue that starts at a young age.

Today was hard at points. Mainly because even though it’s a lot better now, my hypoglycaemia can be so tough to manage and my lows make me irrational. 👏🏼just👏🏼gotta👏🏼have👏🏼protein👏🏼with👏🏼everything. I won’t lie, the thought of b/ping since I’m ‘broken’ (hypoglycaemic) anyway crossed my mind a lot. But I accepted that it’s just a toxic thought … and successfully let it go. Because it could also be worse. I could be hypoglycaemic … with no teeth and more chronic pain.

In spite of toxic thoughts crossing my mind I successfully saved a huge portion of my pay cheque ✔️ (something for future me)and booked a trip with friends because I can now afford it because I’m not spending hundreds (yes, that’s how bad it got) on food. 

Takeaways from today:
- I have so much more time now :,) omg I’m in bed with lunch prepped, washing done, gym gear packed and ready for work.
- My mood is so much more stable. I’m not snapping at people like I used to.
- As I’ve said every update…. WATER AND PROTEIN are saving my life.
- my face has changed even more 😶.
- being stable is hard. It’s hard, but deep down I know it’s the right kind of hard. 
- definitely in a calorie surplus but eating when hungry, giving my body time (45ish mins) to respond before eating more (usually results in eating more hehe but at least I’m in tune with how I feel).
- I am not weighing myself anymore - but my body looks like it’s dropped a lot of the bulimia water weight :-)) (still a big ol balloon belly but she okay, she cute and I trust my body to do it’s thing.

When I would touch them they would just fall out and land in my sink. I remember bursting into tears in my dream and then I woke up literally sweating. 

I’ve been thinking about this all morning. I’m honestly kinda glad I had that dream because it’s just another reminder of why I never want to B/P again. I have such a huge fear of messing up my teeth forever. B/P is not worth ruining a beautiful smile.",1641907377.0

Recovery day 8 ❤️‍🩹,22,s158q5,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s158q5/recovery_day_8/,5,"Over the 1 week bridge 🌈 Skipped the gym this morning because I was tired and instead just incorporated more physical movement into my day. 

I’ve been especially hungry today but not in the “binge binge binge” way. I think this is because I’m finally eating enough protein and fat, preventing my blood sugar from dipping binge inducingly low. I’m also keeping myself well hydrated which I think is helping! 

Being honest with myself and treating myself with respect is changing how I’m carrying myself. I’ve noticed at work I’m taking more pride in what I do because bulimia is my way to live in the ‘short term’ - however, meaningful growth and success requires long term goals and showing up for my future self. In the depths of my bulimia I was only living for the day: get food. Purge. Get more food. Purge. Get even more food. Purge. Repeat.

Takeaways from today:
- While not binge-inducing, my hypoglycaemia was quite bad today. This is a health condition I’m going to have to learn to manage and not conceal with bulimia/tricking my body.
- Lower belly bloat is real! Oh my … it’s something 🤣🤣 but!! I’ve been bulimic since I was a child so of course I’m going to have digestive issues. I WILL manage these and it WILL get better.
- My skin is 1000x better. I’ve been told by so many different people that I’m glowing which has been really lovely.
- My face shape has changed even more! It’s unreal! I’m enjoying seeing the natural frame of my face show. 
- I’m still getting used to hunger and fullness cues but I’m just going to keep trusting my body. 
- I’ve been so much more regular.. if you know what I mean. I attribute this to being adequately hydrated!

Sorry if these are getting repetitive. I’m just finding it helpful to note daily observations. Hopefully it will be good data for the future and maybe helping someone out there who has to go through the recovery process also.

As always, sending love and healing ❤️",1641878825.0
Anyone here also an alcoholic?,13,s17gb1,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s17gb1/anyone_here_also_an_alcoholic/,7,"This is just a rant to get things off my head: 

I’m 54 days sober from alcohol & feeling really proud of myself, I have not had any urges or thoughts about binge drinking at all in the last few weeks and it feels super liberating. At the same time though, I’m currently 6 hrs from my last purge & I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s like my bulimia just makes me feel like I’m failing at the end of the day. Like man why have I just finally have been able to get a grip on not drinking anymore but this stupid disorder, that I know ALL MY TRIGGERS for, still fucking gets me LOL. I go to therapy & so far so good my relapses have a bit more time in between them but ugh I can’t help but feel so stupid for knowing my triggers & knowing my coping methods & all that & yet I just like, in the moment forget all that? I just go & throw up my meal & it’s so hard to get into that mindset of “okay do what you talked to your therapist about, distract yourself.” It gets to the point where sometimes it makes me annoyed that my alcoholism was so easy to start going with in regards to finally staying sober despite it being really bad (I was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe, drinking a Liquor bottle a day), so why isn’t bulimia that easy. I’m just frustrated & wanted to vent",1641886742.0
Reached rock bottom - Any support/guidance appreciated,13,s145xt,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s145xt/reached_rock_bottom_any_supportguidance/,2,"It's hard to even begin writing this, I never thought I'd get to this point.  I've been bulimic on/off since I was around 13, most severely in the past 5 years (I'm now 26).  Somehow, and probably like many people like to tell themselves - I've convinced that I had it ""under control"".  That I could stop anytime I wanted to.  

Over these years I've gotten very good at it.  At hiding it.  At purging.  Quickly and quietly.  I could eat vast amounts of the unhealthy foods I crave and then have them disappear and maintain my weight.  It felt like cheating the system (I know this is far from the truth and I'm completely deluding myself, but that's what an ED is I suppose). I apparently don't have the impulse control to resist my cravings (I also have problems with alcohol, which I guess makes sense..).  So purging became something I just accepted as a necessity, since allowing all the calories consumed to transform into weight on my body was psychologically not an option.  

Until now.. in the past few weeks, something switched.  I wish I could say it came from me, that I decided to stop this.  But it's my body.  After years of being able to throw up quickly and immediately - my body fully refuses to purge.  About two hours ago I went out to the store in a daze preparing for a binge.  I can't even think now of the food I bought because it terrifies me.  I consumed probably around 4,000 calories.  I felt nauseous just from the amount of food I consumed, but after trying for around 40 minutes, I could barely get anything up.  Any bulimic who has tried to purge.. knows how demeaning this is.  Seeing yourself in the mirror after this.  Seeing your knuckles red.  I couldn't feel more ashamed and low as a person.  But I was getting increasingly desperate, thinking of the junk food inside of me and how I had to get it out.  I started googling tips, watching videos I was hoping would induce vomiting.  Watching how-to videos.  Wishing I could get my hands on ipecac.  It's like I wasn't even consciously thinking, was just in an absolute panic to purge this food.  But I had zero gag reflex, I couldn't vomit at all.  It was like my body saying ""no, I'm not doing this anymore, you can't make me"". After almost an hour of trying, I had to give up.  I don't think I've ever felt so low, and defeated.  Not from not being able to purge, but realizing how far into this I actually am, how crazy it is what I'm doing and somehow telling myself is okay?  Just the moral prospect of wasting food like this makes me hate myself. How much time I've wasted.  And then the fact that I'm willingly destroying my health and body.. it's an addiction. It's scary. 

I really hope this is the end of the road for me, where bulimia and I part ways.  Because my body refuses to participate any longer in the workings of my faulty mind.  I can't even bear to go into detail but the last hour was one of the most shameful hours of my life.  And the worst thing is that if it had been ""successful"" - I would feel like I won again, like I'm cheating the system.  But this time there is no winning, no satisfaction, just absolute regret and realizing I really need to stop this.  I've been looking up ED support groups in my area.  That's why I'm writing here.. I can't believe how long this has gotten and can't imagine anyone reading this but I guess this is good to have for myself as a record.  Going to sleep now knowing all the food is still inside me and will digest is terrifying to me, but continuing being bulimic is even scarier at this point.  If anybody has ever been here, or just has any advice or anything - I'd appreciate it.  Love to everyone.",1641875308.0
Gained 15 pounds since New Years and I kinda wanna die,11,s14677,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s14677/gained_15_pounds_since_new_years_and_i_kinda/,4,"I've been eating constantly since New Years, and I've been sick with either the flu or Covid (all the testing centers where I live are by appointment only and fully booked) so I haven't been able to exercise, and somehow managed to pack on 15 pounds.

I felt like I wanted to die. This sounds so terrible to say, but this 15 pound weight gain feels more devastating to me than when I was binging and purging, because at least then I was losing/maintaining weight instead of gaining.

Five Pounds,33,s0vnjs,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s0vnjs/five_pounds/,6,"The five pounds\*–or however many because I cannot bear to confirm the gain on my scale–I’ve put on just this past depressed-binge-bender week makes me want to kill myself. (I’m not going to *kill myself* over this–other mental health issues in my life, sure, maybe, we’ll see how things go–but it gives me the urge to just unplug.) 

I know that that is stupid, but it’s not stupid. It doesn’t make me stupid. I’ll give you vanity, sure, but it doesn’t make me stupid.

It makes me feel worthless and disgusting and unloveable. It makes me want to retreat, hide, and shut off every other aspect of my life. It puts my life on pause until I can correct the failure. This was only depressing and miserable when I had nothing in my life but self-hatred and daydreams of being happy. However, I’ve recently begun construction building a life around myself and filling it with people, but those relationships aren’t put on pause. Instead I ruin them, which I suppose is only fitting for my theme of self-sabotage and destruction.

The gain makes me lose who I am. I become sad, bitter, and just … not myself. My whole personality deflates and everything in life becomes bleak. I feel like my body has been stolen and I am residing in this grotesque, abhorrent, and vile substitute that does not belong to me nor reflect who I am. Yeah, that’s right. My weight reflects who I am. I know that is stupid, but it’s not stupid. And not being able to be myself makes me want to kill myself (not really, I promise).

&#x200B;

You don't care anymore,

You had eaten too much.

It doesn't matter how hard you try,

You want to throw up.

The feeling of your stomach bloating

Is hell.

You just want the ease the guilt,

and get a rest.

So you storm into the bathroom

And close the door,

You are trembling all over

On the floor. 

You force down your fingers,

You **can't** care anymore

The guilt finally eases,

And your food is in the bowl.

Recovery day 7!! 1 week down!! 🥲🥳,37,s0dl2i,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/s0dl2i/recovery_day_7_1_week_down/,12,"One week of not letting this insidious disease win. Definitely an uphill battle but it’s getting so much easier.

I had my first day back at work today. I have an extremely stressful job so I was nervous about how I would cope. However, I had so much more energy to problem solve. I also have some pretty bad family stuff going on. Instead of b/ping at the end of the day to take the edge off everything going on, I went on a walk with my partner and came back home refreshed and calm.

I also nourished myself all day with lots of food AND WATER! No restrictions. Lots of protein and fat. 

Todays takeaways:

- WATER + electrolytes = baaaaazinga!
- meaningful connections are so important. Nourish yourself so that you have the energy to connect with important people. It will leave your cup fuller than a b/p ever could.
- It is just a body!!! Yes, at the end of the day looks matter but not as much as we think. Looking healthy and alive is attractive and it’s enough. Having no teeth and a broken body that hurts for the sake of looking good in my younger years makes 0 sense. 
- pain and urges come and go. Life is painful. Feeling it is part of the human experience. You will get more from the pain than suppressing it with a b/p - I promise.
- Self care NOW! looking after my body and pampering it is helping me reconnect with it.

People sent pizzas and there was lots of Mexican sweet bread (my weakness) so I ate so much but then would sneak away to purge.  I'd go back to sit with my family to reminisce, cry and laugh and then someone would say they were going to get coffee or bread and so I would follow.  I've had weight loss surgery and so eating bread, eating and drinking together as well as eating too fast makes me sick.  It leaves me feeling extremely full (even if it's not a lot of food) which is why I started purging 2 years ago but now since I feel good after purging it's almost comforting to me now.

This morning I woke up STARVING? So I honoured it and ate 1 kg of yoghurt.. no purging or compensating, just went about my day and ate as normal. 

I’m trying my best to listen to hunger and fullness cues. Mental hunger is tough!!

Takeaways from today:

- bloat!!! I’m a balloon 🎈water is definitely helping me manage though! Wow I never used to drink enough water before.
- The feels are still hitting me hard. I am feeling !!everything!! It’s eye opening how much I used purging to numb myself…
- fat and protein are what make me feel best. 
- Spare time!! I feel so much less pressured and rushed due to not having to fit b/ps in.
- checking in with myself to assess what I can do to make myself feel more comfortable sitting with urges is helpful.

the worst combo is sedentary + unemployed + binge-eating,19,rzngrw,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rzngrw/the_worst_combo_is_sedentary_unemployed/,7,"I just had two binge eating episodes tonight brought on by Chinese takeout from my parents for dinner and it really has me spiraling hard. 

like many I've had my ed for over a decade now, and I've meandered my way through various ed behaviors/habits being my primary ones. the past several months I've desperately been missing older stages of my ed where i used to compulsively exercise and honestly had an exercise addiction. it's been many years since. I also miss earlier this year and last year when I was able to restrict more intensely and consistently. I can rarely go a full day without a small meal anymore. it sucks so much. 

my relationship to food and eating is essentially ""it's a right and privilege that must be earned by labor."" always has been, always will be. this is due to capitalism, growing up low SES and with food insecurity, and just my personality. in those earlier stages of my ed, I would use exercise as my labor currency to earn food. as I got older and stopped exercising due to school, I would use academics and work for pay as the labor to earn food. this made the most sense anyway since those things literally got me the money to buy my own food. now that I'm two years graduated, unemployed, and more sedentary and lazy and inactive than I've ever been in my whole life....binges make me feel more debilitated than i ever imagined possible. even more so tonight because I binged on food I DIDNT PAY FOR which makes my guilt a million times worse. I'm eating up all my parents money being here, food they earned and bought from their hard labor. my parents are still pretty piss poor and all I do is sit around all day, stare at screens, and go through the binge-restrict cycle...I barely even go on walks. I feel like the most disgusting lazy slob on this planet. i just want to die. at least if I worked out I would be doing SOMETHING other than cry, eat, take laxatives, and shit. 

FOOD MUST BE EARNED FOOD MUST BE EARNED FOOD MUST BE EARNED I HAVE NO RIGHT TO FOOD UNLESS I WORK FOR IT GOOD FOOD IS FOR GOOD AND HELPFUL AND VALUABLE PEOPLE NOT USELESS WORTHLESS PILES OF FLESH LIKE ME WHY CANT I GET THIS THROUGH MY IDIOTIC HARD HEAD WHY DONT I JUST ROT THE WHOLE FUCK AWAY

 I'll be making a tea to relax and I'm leaving this cursed place it all taste amazing so I'm making it impossible to have the option to eat it now that I still have some sanity left .

I feel guilty enough for eating steak with baked potatoes for lunch instead of chicken breast/fish with veggies  but at least I'm not even satiated , I'll drink a lot of diet coke and be better

I am progressing to this by being one more step further from completely insane Wich is me when I was orthorexic as some people call it , and it is not a lot better cause my terms to not lose control are a bit too much like not even watching junk food

But I can do it cause I remind myself that the orgasms my brain gets are only temporary but the guilt is eternal

my life with bulimia,9,ryzmix,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/ryzmix/my_life_with_bulimia/,0,"idk where to start, i’ve been having an unhealthy relationship with food for as long as i can remember, i was always craving food. in my childhood we didn’t have sweets at home, my family wasn’t rich but we weren’t that poor, it was a personal choice from my parents: they thought it was unnecessary and would say they couldn’t afford it when they would spend their spare money on useless things.


but i was always craving sweets, it was literally my purpose in life. at school during recess i would always ask my classmates to share their snack with me, some would, some wouldn’t. i don’t remember it well but later on i’ve been told i’ve been acting starved during school outings to the point my teacher would ask my parents if they fed me at home. and if we exclude sweets my parents did actually feed me breakfast, lunch and dinner but it was never enough, i wanted more.


i’ve been scolded for acting that way and my parents forbid me to watch other people eat (and i actually listened til this year when i realised there was no harm bc i don’t have that hungry look anymore). in grade 2 i’ve been invited to my friend’s bday and my sister (11 at the time) tagged along, back then i really thought she came bc she wanted to stay with me but i figured my parents prolly asked her to come along so i don’t embarrass them. 


anyway it’s around that age that i started feeling nauseous whenever i would eat my fave foods. at age 9 there was a period where i would throw up everything i ate, it would just come out. i’ve been disregarded, my mom scolded me and told me it was bc i would wear my jacket (around my waist) too tight. my life kept going and i was still starved, at age 12 the same thing happened, my mom took me to the doctor and they said i had a start of anorexia, my mom brushed it off bc i wasn’t skinny.


at that age i started gaining weight, til age 12 i’ve always been a skinny-thin kid but i started gaining weight, maybe it was puberty but i didn’t have my 1st period til age 14. i’ve been gaining weight but i got used to it, even to the fatshaming comments (even if i wasn’t even fat). 

age 18: i started college, got my own money and spent it all on food. got scolded by my parents for that. 5 years later i dropped out of college and was jobless for a year and a half, i was also living alone with my dad for a few months bc my mom was away at my grandma’s, i would eat 1 meal a day and count calories and i actually lost weight. then i got a job and started binging again.



even if i was binging i’ve been pretty stable for almost a year and didn’t feel bad abt binging/want to purge. my company made me work from home for 2 months  and i gained a shit ton of weight. it made me feel worse so during a month i tried to watch what i eat, count calories etc and it actually worked. unfortunately i went back to my old ways and i’ve been trying to purge more often even tho i hate it. friends at work invalidated my struggle “its all in your head” “its just bc u eat too fast”.

in 2020 i started therapy and the following year i decided to mention food so i told my therapist everything and she said that since i’ve been neglected at school and home food was my only source of comfort

Recovery day 5,6,ryvqny,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/ryvqny/recovery_day_5/,2,"Made it to day five! 😮‍💨

Am I uncomfortable- yes! Did the urges come - yes! But I let them come, and eventually go. I think a lot of my bulimia has come from not wanting to feel things. So not only did I have to feel the urges, but I had to feel other emotions I’ve been suppressing my with b/ping. It really hurt. But the human experience involves hurting. The most strong and inspiring people have felt pain and grown from it. 

I definitely ate more than normal, but that’s okay. I’m healing my relationship with food and over eating will happen and it’s normal.

Key takeaways from today:

- lots of protein at breakfast helps. I think hypoglycaemia from too many carbs cause me too binge (this is specific to my body - have had hypo issues since I was a toddler)
- lots of water helps 
- taking moments to pause and ground myself helps
- being kind, but disciplined and with myself is the way forward.
- the book untamed has been pivotal in my change of mindset.

I hope you have all done something for yourselves today. You are all equally beautiful, unique and human. I hope you soon give yourselves the permission to feel the pain and grow.",1641632776.0

I’m not a diagnosed diabetic but the way I felt was the way I imagine a diabetic feels with low blood sugar. Shaky, weak, sweats, the whole nine yards. I should have gone to urgent care but was embarrassed and in a different state so I didn’t want to cause a scene in our group. Luckily I survived but as soon as I got home I checked my blood sugar on my moms meter and it was through the roof! This had me scared to death because now I’m thinking I really have diabetes. Turns out it’s “pre diabetes” now. But from that day on I did strictly keto specifically to keep my blood sugars low. It took 3 FULL days before they did and since have not been over 105 (which is healthy). But the reason I’m writing this here is because my urge to binge has COMPLETELY gone away. I realize now that it was more than emotional comfort eating for me. It was a blood sugar problem. They would be up and down all day and I was CHRONICALLY physically and mentally hungry. Now that my blood sugars are stabilized and I’m no longer spiking my insulin with every meal…. IM ACTUALLY NOT STARVING ANYMORE. I have never experienced this before, it’s like being in a new body. A normal body. I’m eating my daily maintenance calories (which is about 1000 more than I have ever kept down) and my weight hasn’t changed. To be clear I have a HEALTHY BMI, and am not underweight. And I assumed I would gain tons of weight like every other time I’ve tried to recover, but not this time. I haven’t purged in a month since day one of keto and I have never felt better in my life. I will never go back now that I’m never starving and always satisfied with sustaining healthy food. I realize we all have our own unique reasons for this disorder so I’m not saying everyone needs to do this but God it is WORTH a try. I found Dr. Berg on YouTube who is AMAZING. He explains how to do it healthily but also WHY. And it’s a complete game changer. I truly believe keto and Dr. Berg have saved my life. Thank the great almighty God 🙏🏻",1641504817.0
not having a good time :(,7,ry0nqa,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/ry0nqa/not_having_a_good_time/,2,"I went to the psychiatrist the other day and now I'm being referred to IOP and PHP programs. I honestly feel so distraught. I honestly thought I was getting better- I was really trying. At the last appointment, we talked about ""disordered eating"", so she clearly saw the signs but I was offered no (preventative) help it was just a ""stop doing it"". I really did try. Now it's more therapists and hospitals. I feel so overwhelmed, like my mind is stuck in a train and the world is moving so fast around me but I'm still stuck at the part she said ""eating disorder"". This isn't something I can talk to my friends or people I know because a) I don't want to trigger/burden someone with my situation and b) this isn't something I can just *talk* about with anyone. Suffering the consequences of your own actions suck. I couldn't help but feel like my psych was disappointed (at me) when I told them my situation with the target behavior that is now putting me into these programs :( I feel like I'm just going from one therapy to the next. I expressed at the appointment that I was also a bit frustrated I was the only one being sent to therapies. I know I am not the one who makes bad things in my life happen, I am just coping with the bad things. It just feels hard when I'm being sent to these things and being treated (by my family) like I'm the one with the problems and I need to be ""cured"". I don't necessarily blame them, and I really have matured and improved from going to therapy and stuff (I was literally crazy like three years ago- I can say that because I was suicidal-schizo-manic thinking the world was out to get me... I was crazy) but now I have the proper skills/medicines to cope with those things. However once you ""change"" as a person, it sometimes feels frustrating because the people around you stay the same- aka my family. I've asked them if they could come to therapy with me or think of enrolling in skills groups, but only my mom has agreed a few times. I won't discredit them because they have been so supportive of my journey in therapy, and I'm lucky to have access to the treatments I do. I'm just tired of feeling like the problem and having no one in my life to talk to about it.

kinda unrelated, but I was feeling pretty sad when I wrote this and my dog came over and leaned on me and sat in my lap which he normally doesn't do. I think he's really just an angel in disguise. thanks, little dude.",1641536297.0
there is just a chemical urge that is so strong.,26,rxpcct,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rxpcct/there_is_just_a_chemical_urge_that_is_so_strong/,7,"i can write out what i eat in a day, i can know what are healthy choices, i can understand that binging is bad for me, i can understand that starving myself is bad, i can understand that i have the power to make good choices, i know everything. 

but the pure emotional and chemical urge to binge on my comfort foods is insane. unstoppable. it's so horrible because i *know* what is right and wrong. but when i am super upset, it all goes out the window. i get this violent urge to eat unhealthy snacks in unhealthy quantities. 

i cant just ~distract myself ~ and fighting it just seems to cause endless pain. i can abstain from binging, but it seems like i'll never stop this strong emotional craving. it goes on for weeks, months. i'll think about it every single day and it tortures me *constantly*. 

eating one portion does nothing to stop this feeling. and 9 times out of 10 i cant end up controlling myself anyways. i know it's a tactic to not completely ban the binge item from your diet, but instead eat a healthy portion. it just has not seemed to work for me. it seems  i'm fucked no matter what i choose to do. 

i wish i could just put it down and be done with it. ive been struggling with this for years now. *years*.",1641504163.0

I’m a barber and had to manually get poop out of myself at work thanks to bulimia🙃 and information on impacted stool.,8,rxhm4d,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rxhm4d/im_a_barber_and_had_to_manually_get_poop_out_of/,14,"Hi, if you are here because you just started this downward spiral or even if you have been here for awhile…. I hope we can all recover someday because if you’ve experienced poop problems through this or haven’t experienced this yet YOU DONT WANT TO. And I’m sorry for those who have. It’s fairly common for us unfortunately. 
At least once or twice a week now I have to throw a glove on, lube it up and manually poop. Even worse is at work when it feels gross and inappropriate as I work with my hands. I wear gloves while doing it obviously, and wash my hands a million times after and then hand sanitizer my hands till they crack lol. 
I know it’s hard to stop, I still haven’t.
Please drink water, stay hydrated, take stool softeners if you have to. 
And I hate to be informative on this level but I’ve found there isn’t enough info on how to safely evacuate yourself.
This is last resort.

INFO ON MANUALLY EVACUATING STOOL: 

The hospital is the last place you want to be and sometimes you can’t stop what you are doing to go (aka work)
Put on gloves, make sure you have lube, relax, and you literally have have to put your pointer finger in and behind the stool (so back of the anus. Swirl your finger around it until you can hook onto it (I’m sorry) with your finger and push a little. Repeat this and repeat the lubing process to make sure you don’t hurt yourself and try and stay relaxed! 
You will know when it’s gone. You will literally feel empty in that area.
After this drink a ton of water, pedialyte and take a stool softener (try not to do laxatives) 
Enema is last last resort and if you literally have poop at the enterance it is to late for an enema. At least that is what my doctor said.

And if this does not work please do not force anything you will hurt yourself, if this is not an easy process for you please do not continue to try.

Takeaways from today:

- I had so much more energy in the gym.
- Allowing myself to eat whatever in a somewhat structured way and distracting myself in the gaps is helpful.
- Good distractions are self care (ie painting nails/ going for a walk) 
- The bloat is starting to decrease, especially in my lower belly.
- My skin and eyes are a lot brighter.
- I felt more - which was tough, but letting hard emotions resurface is the only way I will ever deal with them. 
- I’ve been crazy thirsty?
- acid reflux sucks!

But I still often feel a similar shoulder stiffness and brain fog and lack of energy or the desire to do fuck all when my purging behaviour is down to about a third of what it was and I am definitely eating way more appropriately.

I hate it so much. I hate feeling this way (and am I being stupid if I say 'looking' this way as well). I'm just so tired.

Recovery day 2,2,rwjmis,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rwjmis/recovery_day_2/,0,"I’ve been bulimic since I was around 12. I’m 26. I’ve tried recovery before. I’ve failed. But I’m trying again. Each time I’ve tried I’ve wished I had someone else’s journey to follow. Therefore, I’m going to try and be that person for myself and anyone else trying to recover. 

How did I get to this point? The bizarre and admittedly darkly funny answer is E. coli. I’ve spent the last few days really unwell, which has meant I haven’t been up to purging. There’s also nothing more terrifying than looking into the toilet bowl and seeing that you’ve (TMI/ trigger warning) pooped out at least a litre of blood. The reality that, while bulimia wasn’t the cause of this, but could have caused this, terrified me. (At the time I thought it may have been historic damage from laxative abuse).

Now I am nihilistic as fuck in the worst way. I don’t want kids or a family and I’ve always felt life is meaningless - so finding a reason to recover has been the biggest thing holding me back. I can’t say why I suddenly want ‘more life’ or why I was so terrified. 

I spent hours in the ER being poked and prodded. I hate blood tests. The white light of the hospital only made me feel sicker. When the doctor gave me the news that I likely had E. coli and wasn’t dying from some sort of damage I had caused from bulimia, I was relieved. But it so easily could have been the opposite. I could’ve been there because of a tear in my oesophagus, a ruptured stomach, damaged colon, a heart attack.

While I was in the ER some friends sent me a 1kg box of mixed chocolates and a teddy bear. I was in the ER alone and they wanted to make me feel loved. I did. On the drive home I still thought about which takeout joints I could stop to binge at, you know to make the chocolates come out easier. However, being from a small town everything was closed at 1 am. So I went home, opened the chocolates and ate a decent amount of them before getting into bed and going to sleep. Feeling loved and with the teddy I might add. Wild to think I could be so unwell and b/ping could still be entertained.

This all happened yesterday. Today most of the chocolates are gone :) and I spent the day resting. I was gentle with myself and it was fucking uncomfortable. But I’ve made it to day 2. I haven’t weighed myself and I don’t plan on it.  

I’ll hopefully be checking in tomorrow with a successful day 3.",1641377667.0

However, I’ve recently developed what seems to be either undiagnosed celiac or gluten intolerance( im still waiting for confirmation, but eating gluten foods makes me literally useless for 2 days straight and I cant breathe immediately after eating it etc). The fact that Ive been unable to keep down food for medical reasons as well as being advised to induce vomit myself to relieve the nausea and pain has really triggered me, and I have spiralled back again. Im so gutted. Aside from this, the fact that I have no choice but to restrict sooo much foods ( i also have a really bad lactose intolerance and histamine intolerance, both of these diagnosed years before my ED started), just makes it so much worse, I dont see how I will ever get better. I am binging in a way I have never binged before due to the super restrictive diet, and when i puke people assume i was sick from something in the food because literally almost everything makes me nauseaous and bloated straight away, which makes it so much more dangerous because I dont even have to hide what Im doing, I have the perfect excuse.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage! Yay!,6,rvw7o9,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rvw7o9/subconjunctival_hemorrhage_yay/,0,"I woke up with my eye feeling weird, yesterday was a terrible day for my ED and I just lost all my energy from BPing. By the end of it I had enough and gave up purging halfway through before any food even came out I was that exhausted from doing it so many times already. Anyway, so throughout the day my eye was hurting and I was annoyed until I looked in the mirror and to my horror there's a fucking lesion on my eye! I googled symptoms immediately and it's definitely a subconjunctival hemorrhage from purging. It's far off in the white part od my eye so it's gonna heal, but how rude? My first bulimia injury is in my god damn eye. Now call me crazy but I value my sight.

I now understand how privileged I am to be destroying my body and taking for granted what some people were born without, be it excessive amounts of food or being able to see. My sight isn't damaged at all and it will heal shortly but this is just one of my waking moments. Before you know it, bulimia could turn from your best friend into a literal backstabber and destroy your life permanently. Don't do this shit. God damn and 13 year old me thought it looked fun because of JaidenAnimations. How I wish I never saw that video.

Knowing this, going forward I won't change. Not until it kills me. I couldn't recover even if I wanted to. Being that I'm not only creepy type ugly but transgender? No chance for me to get anyone to care enough to help. These factors considered, having sympathy for bulimia in the first place is rare. ""Just stop wasting food you god damn sloth!!!"" ""I hate throwing up, I couldn't imagine making myself do that once let alone every day!"" people use us to take out their anger and nothing more.

Having an eating disorder is used as an insult in many families. Mine is no exception, with half of the family having eating disorders and the other half remaining oblivious to the damage, or the ones who know and don't care. I know my brother can hear me throwing up every night. I know my mom has heard me many times. They see the sheer amount of food I can eat at once. They don't even care enough to call me fat or tell me to stop eating. I don't even know anymore. How would they even approach me when I'm such a personality? I guess the things you see about eating disorders is very romanticised to be the cis white girl bullied in school who gets extremely skinny and is perfect at purging, doing it fully and completely silently every time, only to be found out due to a school psychologist seeing Russel's sign, bringing it up with her, for her to break down in tears and confess everything. That's absolutely nobody and we're all complete personalities. With such non diverse portrayal, how is one to even expect someone to know what to do?

tldr: I found out my best friend has bulimia and I don't know how to help

A little bit of a background story about me. My mom is working with anorexic people for a long time, so she watches my eating habbits very strictly. I think she's worried about me getting underweight which made her feed me always a bit too much. I was always a bit chubby and still am because of that. All this led me to recognize signs of eating disorders easily and also struggling with ana myself. But this isn't about me. It's about my best friend. We will call her Mel.  


Mel has been my best friend for quite some time now. She slept at my place multiple times already, so my mom knows her. My mom keeps accusing me of having bulimia because I always go to the bathroom after meals, which made me really angry. I screamed at her because she would not only accuse me of having it, but also my two best friends. She then stated that Mel showed many signs. After our argument I thought about everything and looked at a few pictures of Mel. I had to accept that my mom was right. Mel had swollen cheeks from throwing up and I remembered her thinking, that I was thinner than her (which I'm not). I noticed that I was ignoring all the signs for way to long. Now I want to help her, but I don't know how. I don't want to hurt her feelings, neither do I wan't to be overprotective.   
How should I aproach her?

I came out as bulimic today,3,rvmdn7,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rvmdn7/i_came_out_as_bulimic_today/,2,"I had to because I'm having surgery in my throat/nose on Friday and was concerned about complications. I told my surgeon that I've been bulimic the past two years.

I finally accepted today that my eating disorder, right now, diagnostically, is bulimia. My b&p has been getting way more frequent over the course of the past two years. Really I began b&p and purging when I was ten or eleven (I am now 23), then I quit because I was still gaining weight (because I was growing lol). I then developed orthorexia w restriction then anorexia. Eventually, I was completely anorexic from 15-21. I didn't care so much about food quality anymore because I ate so infrequently. People in my life and doctors/psych people know my eating disorder as anorexia and that's how I've thought of it too. I hit my anorexic rock bottom at 20 and I began the \~recovery path\~ and I really did make a lot of progress. Additionally, I began purging and b&p (idk how to actually phrase these behaviors yet. talking about this is very new) only like 3 or 4 months into my \~anorexia recovery\~. Three years later, I'm full blown bulimic. 

The past three years I've ignored this purging habit because to my understanding of anorexia as its been described to me by the \~professionals\~, purging is a behavior of anorexia, separate of binging. Additionally, binging is a behavior also common in anorexia/restriction. So I just keep thinking of it as my eating disorder which I think is anorexia. I have an eating disorder that has taken forms over the years and has fit the diagnostic criteria of bulimia, anorexia, orthorexia, and binge ed. I don't think I had anorexia and it went away and I developed bulimia. I think that my eating disorder has cycled through a lot of different behaviors over the years. From my perspective, it's all the same disorder. 

So now I'm bulimic but the past two years everyone in my life knows me as a mostly recovered anorexic. I still struggle to eat a lot of the time, but now I'm also bulimic. How do I explain why my eating disorder reinvents itself? I'm mostly just scared about my family knowing because I think I might have to go back to inpatient treatment. How do I explain that I am now bulimic on top of being anorexic? Are they going to think that it's a second issue, separate of the anorexia?

So today I came out as bulimic to my ent surgeon and my best friend, who I explained this dilemma to; the diagnostic contradictions, the complexity of my anorexia/bulimia combo ed, and a theory that I think might be true. Are anorexia and bulimia just the same disease with different behaviors? Idk if I'm anorexic, bulimic, or both but to me it's all just \~the ed\~ the same voice the same thoughts and fixations and feelings mentally almost fucking everything. to me, anorexia and bulimia are the same in different colors",1641273163.0

I guess you could say my issues with food started when I was 16, I'd be too afraid to eat in front of people and I'd secretly eat. But yeah back to restricting my food intake. I'd starve myself until breaking point and then I'd cave and eat. For me, it started off with just needing to be thin, the thinner you are the prettier you are is how I use to see it. So I'd use ana tactics to avoid weight gain but I'd cave after a few days and eat. I felt like a failure like I had no control. So for me it started off with wanting to be thin but ended up being about control. I remember one day I ate some chips and I felt so awful that I decided to purge for the first time and I liked the feeling of being able to control what goes in and out of my body. I liked binging and I liked being able to avoid weight gain. But then my body reacted in undesirable ways and I realised I was killing myself so I had to make a choice. I needed to avoid food intake because then I wouldn't have to purge. And I did, everything that I ate had to be controlled some days I'd eat as little as 300 calories and I felt my body shutting down. I couldn't move and had zero energy, my vision was blurry and ect... But thst wasn't enough because the scale number would barely move down and each time I thought about weight I'd cry because nothing felt thin enough. I felt so ugly and so unworthy of anything good. And that continued for years. 

In my friend group there is a male who would always compliment my female friend and joke flirt with her and stuff which is fine she is a beautiful and amazing person. But I won't lie and say it didn't sting a little bit. I guess I was a bit jealous. It just made me feel so inadequate and almost confirmed that I was just so awful and disgusting in every way. And I feel guilty for that because I know it was dumb. But one night we were all out and I literally had to leave because I felt so unworthy so I went home and just cried. Because how can one person make you feel so low and so unworthy and in that moment I truly believed that I didn't deserve to live do I attempted to kill myself which is both scary and sad to think about. I remember talking to a doctor about things after and they asked about eating habits and stuff. I attempted to be honest, I tried to get help I don't maybe I needed it. But I was shut down. Maybe because I'm not thin enough. Not sick enough. Looking back on it, it made me feel like it was all in my head. I don't have an eating disorder, I've just made it up and sometimes I still feel like that. 

Anyway sorry for the long post.",1641252287.0
Haven’t b/p in 3 days and I feel GOOD!,35,ruzmu3,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/ruzmu3/havent_bp_in_3_days_and_i_feel_good/,6,"I didn’t really make a New Years resolution to stop b/p but I gave myself until 31st Dec to eat and vomit up anything I wanted and then stop in 2022 - so far that strategy is working and although I am tempted just out of boredom and miss eating all those yummy things - it feels so fucking good to actually enjoy my meals now and not throwing them up!! Like my mouth isn’t all dry and cut up and it doesn’t hurt when I eat acidic foods! Also love not feeling so faint/exhausted after a b/p, it took so much out of me! Also used to eat until my stomach hurt soooo much but I’d keep eating anyways and it would hurt to even walk and felt like I was going to explode! Still getting used to the feeling of being a bit full and reminding myself I’ve got so many plans for my future and doing it ‘just one more time’ is a slippery slope that I can’t go down again!

Anyways goodluck to everyone who is making 2022 the year they finally beat this thing! And goodluck to everyone else still battling this - it’s hard but I believe in you and when the times is right you can defeat it 💜

I’ve relapsed abusing laxatives [TW],2,rvjm4z,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rvjm4z/ive_relapsed_abusing_laxatives_tw/,2,"So i had been doing pretty good staying off of laxatives. But as someone who’s lived her whole life in countries that never get too cold, after moving by myself to europe, the winter season has made me gained weight and it’s been stressing me out. I finally found laxatives (and take more than the regular dose) because unless i feel like im literally going to die from the intestinal pain i dont feel like they’re working. I know its wrong and its a total step back but im at a point where i cant love myself and still demand too much of myself. im also working out more than usual. 
i hate myself for thinking that, when i got really sick a few months ago, im always like “but at least it made me lose a lot of weight”. 
idk if its the weather or the fact that maybe i’ve been eating more than i should’ve but i feel that the workouts aren’t working as much as they did when i initially lost weight so pairing it up with laxatives feels like the only reasonable way. 
i know its fucked up but i needed to vent and cant afford a therapist. love u guys and happy new year",1641264649.0
Why can't I have healthy eating habits?,8,rv87kn,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rv87kn/why_cant_i_have_healthy_eating_habits/,3,"I will tell my story.

When I was a kid (between 9 and 10 years old) I used to eat until I vomited and I was an obese child until I was 12 years old or so.

Ok, I grew up (I'm 26 years old) and since my teenager I have problems with overeating (until I got sick and almost vomiting) or eating nothing (at times I went almost 48 hours without eating), I usually spent the day lying down in the bed hungry and I even liked it because it was the only way I had found not to overeat (simply because I couldn't stop thinking and craving alcohol, food or drugs) but this was hindering me in college and work, affecting my health a lot and so I sought psychiatric help.

Since last year I have been increasing alcohol consumption and this year I really abused alcohol a lot. I had never taken psychiatric medicine before, so in March my psychiatrist gave me lithium and fluoxetine... I knew when I started to take medicines I should stop drinking alcohol but I couldn't... however, I stopped my ""hunger strike"" periods since if I took lithium (3x a day) without eating, I would get very sick.

I thought my body was horrible in the past (until March of this year), I thought I was fat and today when I look at my photos I see that I had a very nice body and I was thin (5'3"" and 55kg). In August I suddenly gained 20kg, in September I had already gained 30kg... At the beginning of the medication I still tend to have binge eating episodes (without the starvation episodes), Lithium made me so upset that I stopped doing physical activity, I became sedentary...

and at some point I stopped oscillating between overeating and starving and started eating until I was satisfied (without wanting to vomit ), however, I'm only eating junk food as I almost always did. In the past I was only thin because I did excessive physical activity (also to the point of getting sick, for example, almost fainting) or because I compensated for it by starving and sometimes crash diets that made me very sick psychologically because I was so desperate for drowning in comfort food and pushing too hard to stay on the diets.

Now I'm completely fucked. If I've hated my body before, you have no idea how much I hate it now and I'm honestly getting fed up. My desire to kill myself increases every day.

Even worse is the fact that men who used to flirt with me (and I liked them, I'm not monogamous) now say that my body and face are deformed and they don't want to be with me anymore. The only one who wants to stay with me and help me lose weight is the guy I had the most abusive relationship with, he's the guy who called me fat and careless even when I was pretty (but I only realized that today), he's the guy who I used to get alcohol and comfort food after dates. Today I hate this guy because I fell into reality.

A very nice ex-boyfriend of mine is also constantly trying to help me with this, but I can't accept help from him because I find it extremely humiliating.

I'm crying a lot now because I really want to commit suicide, I want to cut my face and body, I want to disappear, but I know that unfortunately I won't kill myself today.

Oh I almost forgot to say.., I had blood tests and everything was normal except low lithium, so I guess I didn't get fat because of hormones. But that doesn't matter anymore because last month I threw the medication in the trash, I was so angry about this shit medication :) that damn lithium improved one point in my life and ruined another 10

All this talk just to say that I know what I have to do to change this (healthy habits, balanced diet and exercise) and I've been aware of it for months, every day telling myself that I'm going to start doing something to change this situation and I just don't. I don't see any other solution for me than suicide, it's horrible to live in a body that you DEEPLY HATE!",1641234061.0

Who was the first person you opened up to about your ED in an attempt to ask for help?,7,rurixv,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rurixv/who_was_the_first_person_you_opened_up_to_about/,4,"I heard something earlier about how critically important the first conversation you have with the first person you reach out to for help (either directly or indirectly) is. It was explained that the initial conversation is one of the greatest predictors of long-term recovery. I thought about it and in the case of my story, I think that’s definitely true.

So it got me thinking: who was the first person you reached out to for help? What was their reaction? 


————————-

You don’t have to read this part, but to get the ball rolling and hopefully offer hope to someone who may be considering asking for help, but hasn’t yet…

It took me 6 years to directly ask for help. I was in denial for a long time and didn’t think I needed help. When I realized I needed help, I was ashamed and didn’t know how to ask for it. I started acting more openly in an attempt to get someone to notice my less than healthy behavior. Everyone noticed, but everyone looked the other way. As a result, I read this as no one wanted to help me. I was 16 at the time. By the time I got to college, anorexia had turned to full on bulimia coupled with anxiety, depression, OCD, Panic Attacks, ADHD, and PTSD. I was still afraid to ask for help. People noticed, and many tried to offer help, but I was scared and every time they tried to help me, I ran. When I was 23, I finally directly asked for help. I used the word bulimia for the first time in my life and didn’t downplay what I was actually going through. I found an incredibly compassionate primary care doctor and started seeing her once a month for the easiest issue for me to talk about (anxiety). After 6+ months, I learned I could trust her and I told her everything. For the first time in my life, she listened to what I was saying and read between the lines. She didn’t push, she didn’t force anything on me, we just talked human to human. That first conversation turned my life around. It gave me the courage to talk openly with others about it. It allowed me to admit to myself that I was struggling, but that it was okay and that people wanted to help. I strongly believe that first conversation is vastly important and if you haven’t yet, I strongly encourage you to take that risk and reach out to someone. It very likely might change your life.",1641179820.0

I have been in recovery before when I was using bulimia for weight-loss and had it very controlled. 

Since about June 2021 I started to gain weight and having alot more stressful days. I turned to bulimia to cope with both. I am now struggling with b/p cause I am stressed and purging because I just feel fat. 

I have also recently started getting hunger type pains before eating and maybe like 30 mins after eating. The eating portion size does not matter, the pain will come back. So I have been eating more to try sooth the pain.

(Tw weighing mention, disordered thoughts re food)",2,rul7cl,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rul7cl/could_someone_give_me_advice_on_dealing_with/,0,"Hello! So today I made a bad move and weighed myself ( I haven't done so since around Nov and generally try not to).

I have a history of restriction and overexercise (cardio), but have spent the last few months learning to lift weights, and focus on gaining muscle. And I'm pleased that it has worked, I am still the same dress size (one which I'm happy with, but am filling out the same clothes with muscles in areas I haven't really had any before. I have a lil bit of an ass now, and before weighing myself I was feeling quire confident. 

Anyway, so I had a difficult day today, and that wound up giving me the compulsion to weigh myself. For some reason I just couldn't resist it today. I have gained weight. Which is exactly what I wanted to do- after all isn't muscle weight? I look the exact same, maybe just with added muscle, and again, I fit into the same clothes.

I'm really freaking out though and I wish I hadn't weighed myself, what's worse I chose to do it directly after eating and at the end of the day. I want to cry and I'm not really sure about how to stop obsessing over this. I already almost canceled a breakfast date tomorrow to restrict my food intake. 

Does anyone have any advice on my situation, I feel like by just making the small mistake of weighing myself I'm letting numbers rather than reality define me. I know it's muscle, and I know I've worked hard to gain it. I feel really stuck, I know I shouldn't now try to lose weight to return to a number I feel comfortable with, but I'm not sure I can walk around with this number in my head and not hate myself or think I look fat, even though I know it's from muscle.

Sorry if this is a bit badly written, my head feels like it's spinning in circles :) thank you for reading",1641162342.0

I have a therapist, a dietitian, self help books, the thought records, the eating schedule. All of it. The problem I'm currently experiencing is that I now have no coping mechanism for my emotions. I've always been a person that feels emotions in a very intense way, and my ED numbed the pain of those emotions. Two months into recovery I feel like a raw nerve, all the time. It's like the emotions I've been holding back for all of these years are all coming back at once. 

Anyone have any tips on dealing with intense emotions in a healthy way? My therapist and I have done some DBT work on emotion regulation, but I'm still in so much pain.

However, over the past three years, I think I’ve developed it. When it started, I was getting bullied during my senior year of high school. My depression was at an all time high, and I thought that I wasn’t smart or pretty enough to be anyone’s friend. I didn’t do it often, but sometimes I’d eat a lot and then throw up. 

A year and a half ago, I met this amazing guy. I liked him, and I thought he liked me, but he had a girlfriend the entire time. I don’t think he’s a bad person, just immature. But he was the first guy to ever like me, and for him to still want to cut off all contact with me showed me that I wasn’t good enough to keep around. I’d starve myself for close to a day, and then eat like there was no tomorrow. I’d go on runs, buy myself a shake from a coffee shop, down it, and then run as fast as I could until I threw up. I started a retail job, and my mom would always make me shakes. I’d buy something unhealthy from the food court and eat it as fast as I could. Then, I’d chug the shake and then throw it up. At family parties, I’d very discreetly go to the restroom and throw up my food.

Relationships and recovery,7,rs9ry6,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rs9ry6/relationships_and_recovery/,4,"My referral to outpatients is going to take 8 months so the doctor has sent me a book called Getting Better Bite by Bite to start working through alone.

I started reading today. Cried twice, which is a big deal for me as I'm autistic and not very demonstrative with my emotions. I did my yoga and at the end Adriene said to say something kind to yourself, I said ""you don't deserve this"", and cried again. I did the first two exercises in the book, which are about pros and cons of recovery to you and others, and your fears, basically. Also two letters from future you, one if things are going well, and one if they're not.

I have already mentioned to two (supposedly good) friends who I had fairly imminent food-related plans with (bottomless brunch and an afternoon tea) that I'm going through a hard time and might need to postpone or change plans because of the work I need to start. I think having plans not being focused on food is important for my recovery now. 

One hasn't responded at all, one said ""oh OK"", and nothing else.

A big part of my ""cons"" was what people would think and if they would like me less or think I was selfish for being more assertive about what isn't helpful for me right now and this is not helping.

I think a really difficult part of this is going to be acknowledging that some relationships are not going to come forward with me... and I am so insecure and needy (autism!) I will find that very hard. 

Luckily two other friends were much nicer about it. But I think this journey will be an eye opener.",1640892090.0
What is the exact definition of bulimia?,3,rsfz49,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rsfz49/what_is_the_exact_definition_of_bulimia/,2,"I've had this on the mind since I started watching a lot of Erik the Electric vids, and a lot of people in the comments claim he is bulimic in the form of having planned binges (eating challenges/""cheat days"") coupled with extreme amounts of cardio and restriction the rest of the week in order to maintain his weight/physique. 

I've seen a lot of different definitions thrown around here, and I was wondering what the official criteria is that makes something bulimia as opposed to EDNOS, BED, or anorexia b/p subtype. 

Like, does any extreme compensatory behavior count as purging (like fasting or excessive exercise) or is it only vomiting and/or laxatives? 

Also, does the type of binge count (""planned"" vs ""unplanned"")? 

What if you have long periods of just restriction in between? How often does the b/p have to occur to count as bulimia? 

I'm also wondering in regards to myself, because after months of only restriction (what I would have thought of as anorexia: rapid weight loss, intense fear of food/weight gain), I fell into a week of standard b/p (unplanned binges followed by puking, daily), and now I'm in a new pattern of having a ""cheat day"" followed by fasting, excessive exercise, and restriction.",1640908484.0

I used to purge water and healthy safe foods. I weighed 44kg as 21 year old and it made me feel beautiful and empowered. Last year, I had no motivation to quit and I quietly embraced the fact that I will die young because of my disease. Throughout the last year, I had horrible dreams about my demise, saw terrible pictures of girls who died because of bulimia, and felt like I didn't want to be like them even though I am one of them, or was. I am just too frightened of death and the whole idea of causing such horror to the people close to me - and who are aware of my disease - is unsettling. So I decided to quit it. And I couldn't. I lied to those who are closest to me and who were monitoring my eating habits as I was purging small nutritious meals. And then I tried to convince myself that I need energy for school and work and it is unfathomable that a human body can survive like this. I started keeping down the most measly and basic foods like fruits and some veggies and maybe some meat. Gradually, I was able to have a full meal in a day but nothing else since I am still haunted by the body-perfect obligations that I had made for myself. Then, the most unexpected thing happened. I didn't gain weight! Maybe 1 or 2 kgs but not that alarming at all. It took so many years to realize that eating amounts of food correspondant to your body needs maintains your weight and doesn't make you gain any. I started being regular and saw my body change for the better. A few weeks a go I started BP again like twice a week but I stopped again because I REALLY want to heal.

The other day I ate over 3000 calories worth of salad, veggies, fruit, chicken and eggs in the first half of the day, only to the point of mild fullness, and then was still extremely hungry the rest of the day. Eating 2000 calories in a day feels the same to me as extreme restriction does, because either way, I'm spending the majority of the day so extremely hungry. Literally the only time I ever feel full is after a binge. There have been so many times this week where I have wanted to binge for no other reason than to just not feel this extreme hunger for a little while (I've resisted the binging urges so far though, which is good...making progress maybe?).

Over Two Months Without Purging But My Throat Gets Worse...,2,rroh8k,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rroh8k/over_two_months_without_purging_but_my_throat/,2,"Back in 2020 I started feeling like there was thick mucus in the back on my throat that I couldn't clear or swallow. I had a purging break between March 2020 and the summer (after regularly purging since early 2018), since I was living with my parents at the time and didn't know how to hide it from them. This may have started during the break, but it continued after I started purging again, and it only got worse after I moved into my current apartment and again quit purging. I'm going to hit my three month mark in a week and I don't even feel the urge for it anymore, which is great.

But my throat is awful. It's been clogged with mucus for months. It gets sore, swollen, and scratchy with my attempts to clear or swallow mucus and there is no solution yet. Today it didn't matter how much I hydrated, how humid I kept my apartment, what I ate, nothing. I've been tested for Covid three times in the last two months out of concern about this, including for Christmas, and it's been negative every time.

Has anyone else been through this? Were you able to see an ENT about it? Are there OTC medications that can at least give me some relief? (Mucinex isn't really making a difference) I haven't been able to concentrate on anything because of this.",1640826990.0

I don't know whether it's bulimia,3,rrf0m1,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rrf0m1/i_dont_know_whether_its_bulimia/,3,"Bulimia is defined as ""bouts of extreme overeating followed by fasting or self-induced vomiting or purging.""

I have the overwhelming urge to vomit. Sometimes it's because of my body image, sometimes it's because my anxiety makes me so nauseous. I hate it and it just makes me more nauseous afterwards.

I've never binge eaten for this purpose so I don't understand what it is?

I know this is common in people with EDs because of malnutrition and stress. 

But I also have another problem, and this one isn't as common, or at least not commonly talked about  - my skin doesn't heal anymore. Any time I get a cut or scrape anywhere on my body, it will continually scab over, but it just won't heal. When I first started noticing this happening, it was just that I would scar much more easily. But now the cuts/abrasions won't even heal enough to become a scar. 

Is this possibly also a side effect of malnutrition, like hair loss, or is it something else? Has anyone else dealt with this?",1640755308.0
Severe hair loss,10,rqq5jw,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rqq5jw/severe_hair_loss/,8,Hi all! I’m a 20 year old female. I always had thick hair my whole life but the last few months I have had extreme hair loss and thinning. My hair is less than half of what it was. I work in the hair industry and this breaks my heart. I see a lot of hair growing but it’s not at the same rate as me losing hair. I was bulimic for about 10 months. And I am also epileptic. I am on lamictal for seizures. I thought it was my medication but it’s not a common side effect and my doctor said it’s not it. (Not sure tho). I also have an issue with my gut 🙃 I believe it’s c.defficile. Not sure. But I have had stomach issues for years. IBS and now this. My hair stylist is shook with how much hair I’ve lost. You don’t even need to brush it after the shower you’ll see how hair is just falling off. What could it be? And how do I fix it? This is so hard breaking.,1640726803.0
harmless crush triggered an episode - help?,4,rqx3gd,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rqx3gd/harmless_crush_triggered_an_episode_help/,4,"So I met a girl. I asked for her number in the club and we went on our first date. The day of the date I was really nauseous and felt sick. I havent ate bc I didnt want to be bloated and I knew it would affect my confidence (not me pulling a cassie). Beside that I also purged because I knew it would boost my confidence (she is a above my league, at least in my eyes) so I knew that if I didnt feel comfident I would fuck up the date and also confidence is hot and I wanted to be extra hot that day. Fast forward few hours later we are on our way to get coffee and I almost fainted and felt like I would die for a second. I was nervous all the time. But it went well. 
We made plans to go out again and I was nervous four days prior. Like really nauseous and again the day of the date was really bad and I purged again. In a way I like it bc of the feeling of control but again I dont want to associate her with that part od me. And I was doing really well and was clean for more than a month.  
And she is sweet, pretty, petite and very thin so I still feel insecure around her especially because we are the same height. I dont think she has an ED, she doesnt show any sings of it at least so I dont think she would understand. Its all too early to know anything about her but all I know is that we made plans to go out again and the  pre-date anxiety is killing me.I just hate the feeling of nausea without a reason.",1640745984.0

Help Please: I can't stop making myself throw up,3,rqxjj4,bulimia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/rqxjj4/help_please_i_cant_stop_making_myself_throw_up/,2,"Hi everyone; I'm so sorry that my first post has to be a desperate cry for help. I really just cannot find any information on how to stop this, and my current situation doesn’t allow me to ask for professional help. I'm an almost 17 years old girl and i've been trying to recover from bulimia for a while now. I started making myself throw up at around 13, and stopped at 15 once my parents found out about this. Ever since I have not tried to make myself throw up. However, about 5-6 months ago now, I started feeling so very nauseous after eating, mostly around dinnertime, and I just ended up throwing up without intending it to happen. It wasn’t frequent, but started happening much more frequently (around 2-3 times per week) and now im nearly throwing up every single day. I feel so nauseous that I start seeing black and then I throw up. I've told my parents about seeing a doctor before, but they just get angry at me and insist im not trying hard enough. Im really scared and worried because there’s really no way I can stop it from happening; It's almost automatic now. 

For background information, I'm 166cms tall and the last time I was allowed to weigh myself, around 3 months ago, I was 51kgs. My lowest weight was 48kgs. I do ballet on a regular basis and I'm anemic. I'm having 3 meals a day. I've tried drinking ice water, using peppermint essential oil, doing breathing exercises and things like that to help calm down the nausea but so far it really hasn’t helped much… Im really hoping anyone has any tips or any sort of advice that could help me stop feeling this way and finally recover properly… It's so distressing having to hide this from my parents, it's like I'm making myself throw up all over again but this time I dont even have control over it. I feel so so powerless and worthless whenever it happens… I really just want it to stop, I want to be healthy and I'm kind of afraid of dying now 😭 I'm grateful for any sorts of advice and I apologize for any broken english since it’s not my first language :'(",1640747293.0

It can happen at anytime, and to anyone, stay safe guys

So many of us will always have the thinking that it will not happen to us, that we won't be the one who suffer from complications, we won't be the one that have to face the consequences of our actions, we won't be the one that will suffer physically. 

Guess what? Yesterday I had another binge and purge episode after restricting for so long and I purged significant amount of bright red blood out. And my stupid ass still didn't want to go to the hospital until my dad screamed at me. 

It really can happen to anyone, at anytime. You will think that you are immune. You won't be the one who suffers a tear in your esophagus, you won't be the one ending up in a hospital. But guess what, your body will call it quits. Your body will FORCE YOU TO REST BECAUSE IT CANNOT TAKE THE STRESS YOU GIVE IT.
