I always envy ppl that do not find food pleasurable.,10,sxcd6l,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/sxcd6l/i_always_envy_ppl_that_do_not_find_food/,3,"I grew up in the South and when I was little I was encouraged to eat all of my food. I did it and enjoyed it but I really enjoyed the praise I would get for cleaning my plate. 

Fast forward now, I have a love hate relationship with food. A few years ago I lost the weight and got down to my ideal body weight. I looked so good. 

However, ppl were telling me that I was too thin and how I shouldn‚Äôt waste away, etc. So I started eating more. (Now looking back, I think they were just talking ish- I‚Äôve learned that sometimes ppl will say things to sabotage your hard work bc they can‚Äôt see themselves doing the same thing or just envy.)


Now I‚Äôm 22lbs overweight and I am really not feeling myself. (Not blaming them -blaming myself) I wish I could go about my day and not think about food. I always envy ppl that do not find food pleasurable. Food is a drug for me . It really sucks. 



It doesn‚Äôt help that I am 5‚Äô1 so every single pound counts. My lowest was 115 and I looked and felt  great for my frame. I wish I could train my brain to not think about eating  food so much. 

However, when I was at my lowest weight I felt like crap bc all I did was obsess over my next meal. (I wasn‚Äôt hungry I just wanted to stuff my face bc I was taught to clean your plate AND ask for more food! )I enjoyed the process of overeating. Savory foods and salty fries are a weakness for me. 

I really feel my brain is messing with me. Most of the time I‚Äôm not even hungry I‚Äôm just bored! ü•¥ Every day I will tell myself that I‚Äôll do better after a binge, and the cycle repeats itself. I‚Äôm literally doing it out of habit now. 

I‚Äôm on the journey to weight loss again and I‚Äôm down 5lbs. It sucks though. The hard part is, I look at my scale & i cringe at the number. I know that isn‚Äôt good but it‚Äôs so off putting bc I know I can do better. I‚Äôm so disciplined with other things in my life but food is my weakness. I‚Äôm turning into my mother and I hate it. 

She would yoyo diet and binge my entire childhood and she‚Äôs still trying to lose weight in her late 50s. I hate the lack of self control. 

Also in my community it is praised to have ‚Äúmeat on your bones‚Äù. I never liked that mentality. Every time I gain a few pounds someone will say there‚Äôs that womanly shape so beautiful üôÑ. Ewww ( this usually is from other women too). 

It‚Äôs so hard for me to love myself like this. I don‚Äôt go out when I‚Äôm heavier, post photos etc. I barely like to look in the mirror at myself. üò™

TLDR: Just venting. I wish I had more self control around foodüò´. I‚Äôm starting to hate myself bc of the overeating.",1645393782.0

 Lost 30 kg (66 lbs) in a year and a half , I didn't even eat sometimes for 2 or 3 days , life seemed better , I kept the weight in control  for around 5 years , had my ups and downs but never felt that I had a food addiction.
 All changed after a break up , it didn't hurt me so badly, I just realized something was wrong with me , struggling with depression, stopped caring for my image and health.
 In one year I had gained around 37 kg(81 lbs) and reached my highest weight ever 132 kg (290 lbs).
  Started to read books ,watch YouTube videos about binge eating and eventually went to a therapist to try and solve all my issues ,including food addiction, things were better , lost some weight but it didn't last long.
 The last 3 months I gained 10 kg and I'm so mad about it.
 I think about food 24 hours per day ,either I'm eating or not , my first and last thought is about food.

I've had really intense dreams, at work I feel paranoid and like no one likes me and I feel like crying pretty regularly. This morning my vet appointment had to be cancelled/rescheduled and I almost had a meltdown and did cry a whole bunch. Like this isn't normal and I shouldn't be reacting this way to perfectly normal things. I do suffer from depression but this is very different than my depression.

Is this a normal reaction to food withdrawal and changing the kind of food that enters your body and I just need to ride it out or do I need to see a doctor?

Found a Video Today That Actually Helped Me not Binge for the First Time in a Long Time,24,sjycbr,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/sjycbr/found_a_video_today_that_actually_helped_me_not/,2,"I recently found a YT video that helped me get through today without binging.

Maybe it'll help you too... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnSYbWg6mdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnSYbWg6mdY)

I think the reason it helped me, was that the video allowed me to gain a little mental distance from the tidal wave of the compulsion to binge. This meant that rather getting mindlessly swept away by the habitual cravings and binge cycle, I could actually think about why I was binging (when I'm fully aware and feeling the consequences and risks every day). 

It helped me realise that I'm just using it as a way to escape feeling negative feelings/feelings of discomfort, for a whole host of reasons. Once I realised that, I found I was able to just sit with the discomfort and just 'feel' it for a change, rather than just binge like usual and numb myself with the usual food coma.

I feel completely hopeless,23,sfp61u,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/sfp61u/i_feel_completely_hopeless/,16,"Hi. If you feel like reading a novel-length post, go ahead.
I think writing my feelings down might help me understand my thoughts a little bit better and hopefully some of you can relate or help.

I am 25 years old, soon to be 26, and I am obese. My body and food consist of 90% of my thoughts. I can't think of anything else. When I feel happy, I am always reminded that ""yeah but ur fat"". I am losing my mind. 

Here is some context. During my entire childhood and teenage years, I was naturally thin. I ate whathever I wanted, whenever I wanted, for as much as I wanted. And I always ate super super fast. I did extremely minimal physical activity. But I remained thin. Not the kind of super skinny that people would mock and say ""eAt a BuRgEr"", just really beautiful, perfectly thin, according to the stupid societal beauty standards.
However, when I entered my adult years (at around 18-19), I started noticing that I was slowly gaining weight, and my appetite was increasing. I thought it was unfortunate, but I still had a relatively ""normal"" BMI so I didn't really do anything about it. Then in my early twenties I noticed I actually crossed the line from ""normal"" to ""overweight"". I was disgusted by myself, by my appearance. I tried to do some workouts regularly (from Youtube), and I did it for like 2 months but it did absolutely nothing. (The problem was mostly my eating, but I didn't realize how much of a difference it made back then, I thought weight loss was solely about exercise). So I just kinda gave up. Then,  a bit later (2 years ago), I was at my biggest. My bmi went from ""overweight"" to ""obese"" and that's what broke me. I just couldn't believe it. I remember looking at my phone, on my ""samsung health"" app and seeing the word ""obese"" and having tears in my eyes. It felt unreal. So I started working out. 30 to 40 minutes, 5-6 days a week. Intense workout to the point where my clothes were completely soaked with sweat at the end. I did a lot of cardio and some muscle exercises as well. I also told myself I wouldn't eat dessert. The dessert part lasted maybe two weeks, but I did the working out part for more than a whole year, without fail. But I hated it so much. God, I wanted to die everytime it was time for working out. It's all I thought about during the day: ""i don't wanna go home after work bc I don't wanna work out"". Then when the workout is over: ""f*ck, i'll have to do it all over again tomorrow"". I sometimes cried because I hated it so much. God, I was miserable. So one day I just stopped because I couldn't handle being so miserable anymore. And for what? Not even 10 pounds lost in an entire year of working my butt off. So it's been a year since I stopped working out now. But I do make sure I stay active (I work as a daycare educator so I move around a lot during the day and I walk to go to work or go back home for at least 20-25 minutes, 5 days a week. So at least I have that).
My problem is eating. My doc says I have insulin resistance, according to my blood test results. It's like pre-pre-diabetes. And it makes it impossible for me to lose weight because my body is in a ""let's stock up on fat"" kinda mindset. The only way I can potentially lose weight would be to eat a keto diet. I tried it for a week this summer and I hated it so much. It was so expensive and tasteless and complicated and boring. I gave up. I am so ashamed.
Anyway, I saw my doc back a couple months ago and we both came to the conclusion that I had a food addiction. I read the book ""food junkies"" by Vera Tarman, as my doc suggested, and yeah, I can confirm I really am a food addict. But that book made me even more depressed because I feel like I'm just gonna be stuck with this obsession my whole life. Anyway.

I feel completely miserable. It feels so hard to change my eating habits after almost 26 years. My work schedule makes it a bit complicated too: I start at 10h45 and have my break at 14h45. Usually I don't get breakfast and just have lunch at around 11h30, with the kids. I work in a daycare and we either have to eat the same thing being served to the kids at 11h30, or eat your own lunch at your break. But my break is at 14h45 so it seems way too late to have lunch... The meals at work are in accordance to the ""mediterranean diet"". So it's healthy and nutritious, just not keto at all. And for supper, I eat what my bf cooks (it's his task in the household, I know it's unusual but we both agreed on it since it is a task that stresses me out too much). And on friday and sunday, we have takeout instead of cooking. I know, two days of takeout a week is a lot. I feel very gross and ashamed of it. On weekends, it depends. Usually I have like a sandwich for lunch/breakfast (i wake up very late) or nothing at all and then eat whatever my bf makes for supper. For dessert, that's usually where I went crazy back then, but ever since the new year, I took the resolution of only eating a little 40 cal cup of yogurt and then maybe some dessert I brought back from ""snack time"" at work (usually some bland muffins or cakes made without sugar that don't taste much). There are maYbe 4-5 days when I cheated, though. (Like when I was seeing my extended family or friends) and had some heavy dessert.
I don't know if this month of reducing dessert had any success in terms of weight. I haven't weighed myself ever since my last doctor appointment in november. I'm too scared. It probably didn't change anything since It's not keto anyway.

I feel so freaking depressed. I know if I want to start losing weight, I have to start doing keto but just thinking of it makes me want to puke. I hate cooking with  a passion. It's long and boring and it makes so many dishes to wash (god I'm lazy. I feel so bad about being lazy but I can't help it.) And a lot of times, it's not even that good in the end. And i'm still hungry afterwards because I eat fast and never feel full. And I finish work at like 18h, arrive home at 18h30, so cooking is the last thing I feel like doing. And I'd have to start preparing my own lunch for work and eat it at 14h45. Ugh. More prep. More dishes. And then I guess I would have to eat breakfast too, which makes even more calories and carbs to manage. It's so STRESSFUL having to manage everything and I'm a perfectionist so I know that I will want to do it perfect and if it's not I will just give up because I can't stand mistakes and aaasnrnruebdjgsashdbdvrjehgsjrvdujrhe. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I really do. 

I feel so pathetic. Am I no able to lose weight simply because I'm lazy? I hate myself. I look at my body and want to cry. I don't know if it's worth it to keep trying. I feel so alone in my situation. I feel stuck. I feel so dumb and stupid. I don't feel motivated for anything anymore. I am so tired... i just want to be a child anymore and have a normal appetite and eat like a normal human being. I am so lost...

Finally admitting I had/have a problem,11,s8eppq,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/s8eppq/finally_admitting_i_hadhave_a_problem/,1,"TW: eating disorder recovery
I have always had a bad and unhealthy relationship with food since I was a child. At around 12, I developed anorexia and was severely underweight to the point I lost my period for over a year and had to eat in a calorie surplus to stay alive. I remained relatively thin up until age 15, when my decade long run with bulimia and binge eating started.
It started off because I was going through puberty and I was unhappy with my developing body and wanted to remain thin to combat accepting I was growing up. I began binging and purging my food. I began sneaking food and purging over 10x a day. I was gaining weight, so I downloaded myfitnesspal and would try to track my calories to lose weight which proved to be very ineffective for me because I'd eat 1200 calories and then feel hungry then binge and purge and start the cycle all over again. When I was 19 I lost 32 lbs restricting myself at 1200 calories but I literally would be obsessed with food and I was miserable. I gained all of it and more back within 3 months. My longest run of not binging or purging was when I was the most depressed I've ever been in 2019 and half of 2020 after something very traumatic. I was not healthy but I gave up and didn't care.
In Sept 2020, after a hospital stay, I was put on a very high dose of seroquel. I know people say it can cause increased appetite and weight gain, but I refuse to blame my weight gain on it. After 6 months of being on it I managed to gain 70 lbs and I lost control of my life. I was starting to feel like myself again after the depression so my old habits came back. I would walk to the grocery store and buy a bunch of junk food everyday sometimes twice. My husband and I would order food to the house multiple times a day. Everyday I would promise it'd be the last time and I'd start over and be healthy tomorrow, but binging was the only thing comforting me. I would purge a couple times a day because it made me feel a little better about myself and less full and like a failure. In 2021 I was desperate to lose weight but food was all I could think about. I would write the day off because I wanted to binge that day. If I tried to not eat I would be constantly thinking about food. I tried tracking calories but it never worked because I'd binge and have a million day 1s and tracking food just made me constantly think of when I could eat next. My binging was the worst at night and I'd be anxious every night before I went to sleep that I'd binge and then in turn I'd binge. It caused problems in my relationship too because I'd eat my husband's food and he'd have to hide food and I had absolutely no self control. I hated myself and I thought I would never be able to have my life back.
In October, I decided I was done with trying to diet and track calories or weird restrictions like being vegan. I decided I was going to try to only eat when I was actually hungry and stop when full. I'll admit it's extremely difficult to try to listen to your body and I still don't think I have the hang of it yet. But suddenly I began thinking about food so much less. I was always afraid to cook because I'd have to measure it out to track calories, but I do now and I can't believe what I was missing out on. I have messed up and binged many times but the non binge days are out numbering the days I do. In the past several months I have lost 20 lbs with hardly any effort. I also stopped weighing myself daily or weekly because the number would constantly discourage me and make me give up and binge. I'm not recovered but there's finally hope. I'm going to try to eat regular meals of real food and exercise everyday in some form. It's hard but I finally am starting to feel free.",1642669284.0

My recovery from food addiction with an appetite suppressant,25,s4kcu1,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/s4kcu1/my_recovery_from_food_addiction_with_an_appetite/,16,"Hello,

Male, 27, final year med student.

I used to have food addiction with some anorexia nervosa component (rather ""fitness anxiety"") since my early 20s. Recovery took me a very long time. I wish I knew the following much sooner - it would have spared me a lot of suffering.

I did recover and ended up at a normal weight (70kg at 173cm) and caloric intake (2500-3000kcal).

However, after recovery though, I was hungry all the time. Always. And soon after eating I found myself to be extremely hungry again within an hour or so, no matter what I ate. Also, normal meals would not satiate me. This led to always choosing high-volume foods (e.g. huge salads) so that I do not overeat. The cravings also led to me becoming addicted to chocolate, which I was nibbling on throughout the day. I knew that this was psychologically unhealthy but I could not help it. Furthermore, due to my excessive hunger, I always had to bring snacks along with me whenever I went out as every hour or so, I needed to eat something as otherwise I would get very weak and hungry. This was a huge hassle.

I did a lot of research and great a lot about hypothalamic issues with energy expenditure and hypothalamic causes of obesity. There seems to be a lot of experimental and observational data that after weight loss, energy centers in the brain become faulty and energy expenditure drops and appetite increases. This is reported for past contenders of The Biggest Loser. [(Study: Persistent metabolic adaptation 6 years after ""The Biggest Loser"" competition)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27136388/)

This is were semaglutide comes in. After talking to a doctor friend, who is using GLP1-agonists himself as a lifestyle drug, I did my own research and gave it a shot. Semaglutide is a GLP1 agonist and is basically sending a satiety signal to your brain (very simplistic). It is an antidiabetic drug and has powerful appetite suppressant benefits. **I do** ***not*** **abuse its appetite suppressant effects, but rather work** ***with*** **them. Having a ""normal"" appetite, allows me to stick to a meal plan that suits my needs and preferences, which is just not in the cards if I am ravenously hungry all the time.** I monitor my weight (68kg) and calories (around 3000kcal/d) and since starting semaglutide I have not lose any weight but the following things changed:

* my night time resting heart rate increased by 10-15bpm (before it was 38 and now it is like 52)
* my body temperature normalized and the severe heat intolerance went away that was plaguing me for years
* my thyroid hormones rose quite a bit and my TSH tripled; my testosterone levels more than doubled (they are now average)
* Most importantly: the ravenous hunger is gone. It is just gone. I can now eat even nothing for hours without feeling weak. Also, a normal meal keeps me satiated like a normal person. Before, basically I have not experienced complete satiety for perhaps 7-8 years and just accepted the constant low-level background hunger. At first, when I experienced the initial bouts of physiological satiety, I was moved to tears many times. Now I really understand what it means for a drug to change someones life.

By eliminating my ravenous hunger, semaglutide has removed the (putatively) ""psychological"" component of my former eating disorder and it allowed me to work rationally with a meal plan which I can now stick to. Before, this was not possible, because no matter what I tried I was *always* hungry (other than when I was fasting - which we all know is a slippery slope).

I have now been on it for 4 months and never before has any intervention changed my life so much. It basically allows me to feel ""normal"". Also, for the first time in years I know that I do not have food addiction anymore (before ""deep down"" I always knew - esp. as my body was constantly craving nutrition).

I just want to put this out there so others can do their own research and potentially make their own educated decision while working with a medical professional.",1642253409.0

Feeling hopeful for the first time in my life. Finally treating my ADHD is changing my life.,27,rtybu4,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/rtybu4/feeling_hopeful_for_the_first_time_in_my_life/,19,"I've always struggled with binge eating. My ability to keep myself in check would come and go, but as soon as I felt even an inkling of overwhelm, my binge eating would reach astronomical levels. I could eat without ceasing. I'd almost never feel full. It was like I was a bottomless pit for processed foods. 

My entire life, I've dealt with undiagnosed ADHD. It wasn't until I was taking abnormal psychology in college and we discussed the DSM definition and signs of that I realized I did every single thing. 

Still, I didn't seek any sort of medication or anything. I felt like I had it under control, and I kind of did. Had good grades. Performed well enough at my jobs. 

But I'd get overwhelmed so easily. Focusing on any task that I wasn't interested in took a monumental amount of time and effort. I could never complete any goal I set out to complete. I had a chronic case of ""shiny object syndrome."" 

And unless I focused an obscene amount of effort into it, I could not maintain an even close to healthy bodyweight. 

If I slipped up at all, I could eat enough to gain 30lbs in 2 months. Or 11.5lbs in a week. 

After struggling with this for over 30 years, someone finally suggested that I give some ADHD medication a try. 

At first, I balked. ""I don't need meds. I've got this under control!"" But I didn't. I had tried every holistic method for controlling it that I could think of, including EFT Tapping and meditation. And while those did help, I was still having a lot of unpleasant side effects from my ADHD. 

So I decided to give it a try for a month. Just to see if it helped. I spoke with a doctor and was prescribed two medications, a non-stimulant, non-habit-forming one for ADHD and a medication the doctor said she'd found had increased the benefits of the ADHD meds, which I believe is technically classified as an anti-depressant. 

It has been close to three weeks that I have been on these medications, and the difference is... unbelievable. I genuinely never knew I could be this clear-headed. I can focus better on work. My meditations go deeper. I can handle stress with friends and significant others sooooo much better because my brain doesn't loop our disagreements for hours and hours on repeat. 

And, the biggest surprise of all... I am finally free from the compulsion to binge eat. 

As the medication was getting into my system (one takes 3-5 days, the other can take up to 6 weeks), I would occasionally feel the ""twinge"" of the compulsion to binge on a food, but as fast as it came, it left. I could recognize it as a compulsion, and I could let it go. 

I finally felt like I could calorie count and not get overwhelmed and upset at the prospect like I always had before. 

And then, as the second medication began to build more in my system, I suddenly found that I could eat a normal amount of food and be full. Without even trying, I am hitting at or below my caloric goal. 

I eat when I'm hungry, and when I get full I stop. **When I get full.** I *finally* get full! I'm *finally* not the bottomless junk food pit that I have been my entire life. 

And I finally feel like I can actually do this. For real. Forever. That I can finally have a normal relationship with food and reach and maintain a healthy weight.

Happy New Year Everyone! My quick message to all those struggling with food addiction...,40,rsr7jh,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/rsr7jh/happy_new_year_everyone_my_quick_message_to_all/,7,"
In my country there are only a few hours before the New Year. Many of you, like me, probably already have your New Years Resolution: overcome this addiction and lose weight. It‚Äôs probably the same resolution you had last year, and the one before that. 

I want to say to all of you now that you can and will make it. Identify your triggers and get rid of them. Just do it. Your health goals are so much more important than that temporary pleasure you receive from food. Seriously, we put ourselves through so much hell with this addiction. I know that for me, I put my life and goals on hold so that I could indulge. And for what? Here is the thing: we could eat forever and it will NEVER make us satisfied. It is an illusion, and one that will leave us depressed, lonely and hopeless if we continue to fall for it. If you‚Äôre like me, you become sneaky and latch onto your addiction like your life depends on it, but see it for what it is. We are stuck in an abusive relationship, believing the addictive voice cares for us when in fact its only desire is to ensure our own demise.

But it‚Äôs time to start anew. Forget that you overate on Christmas or that you didn‚Äôt follow your diet today. Forget the thousands of times you tried and failed your diet. Instead remember the times that you interrupted the destructive, addictive thought patterns.
Envision a life in which you are in your right-sized body, achieving your life‚Äôs dreams rather than attempting to fill a void which will never be filled. Imagine it in detail. Now know that it‚Äôs going to happen. It will happen because all of you are STRONG and POWERFUL individuals who control your lives exactly as you please. You deserve peace and happiness, and the freedom to enjoy food as it is meant to be enjoyed. 
I believe that inside all of us, buried deeply is the knowledge that we are absolutely capable of being free from this addiction. The power of the human spirit when combined with a will is a terrifying thing, but use it to your advantage. Abandon self-pity - it is one of the tricks the addictive voice plays on us. Instead allow yourself to be filled with positive energy, and remember that you ARE WORTH IT!!!

Happy New Year to all of you! See you next year when we are free!",1640947068.0

In search of freedom,9,rjiq8w,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/rjiq8w/in_search_of_freedom/,3,"My history with food is not a great one, like I'm sure everyone else in this groups is. I've struggled with body image for as long as I can remember, growing up watching America's Next Top Model and being told I was overweight as a child wasn't the ideal way to be brought up. My grandma shoving snacks and cookies at me and then saying I would be prettier if I was thinner was not the best way to be brought up. I can't put the blame on anyone but myself now. 

I've been an addict ever since I was young, drugs, alcohol, food. I've used alcohol and drugs as a way of coping with the numbness I've always felt, but now after being sober for almost 2 years (yay), I've found myself using food in the same way.

It's an everyday struggle, and I had it under control for the first year of my sobriety, but now I'm right back where I started with food. Some days are better than others, but most aren't the greatest. I find myself waiting to be alone to eat because I'm ashamed at the sheer amount of food I stuff into myself. Every night ends the same, me lying in bed feeling miserable and defeated, telling myself tonight is the last night. The next morning is always the same, me not wanting to look at myself, feeling depressed, having heartburn, body aches, sweats. And yet the cycle repeats.

I'm here because I want help, and I want people I can talk to comfortably about my problems. Ever since I got sober I haven't had any real friendships, which is heartbreaking. I feel I can't talk to my boyfriend about this because I'm so ashamed and embarrassed by it, and I feel he'll only tell me it's okay and it's not a problem. 

I've been reading through some posts the past couple of days and I've already added a couple books to my Amazon cart.

Since the end of the first week of November  I (largely) stuck to the carnivore diet. I had a few slip ups along the way. The incredible thing was how much it affected my mood in positive ways (and cleared up my eczema in a matter of days). 

Each time I fell off the wagon, whether it was an evening or a day of binge eating I could notice my symptoms returning. 

I know there is controversy and objection to this by some, which I understand, but for me eating this way has been the most sustainable and definitely less destructive than my typical diet.

Carb cravings are a real thing though and I've found that when I fall off I will fall off hard and it can be a challenge to get back on track. Seeing the light though, the difference it made in how I felt was very helpful for me sticking to a better meal plan.

Normally, this wouldn't be a problem. But then my mother invited me to the same buffet on Tuesday, and I went because I needed to talk things with her. And the same thing happened where I ended up binging.

It's 2am, despite being awake for a conventional 16 hour period, I'm restless in bed. Unable to sleep. That's where the weight gaining meals come into play. I can't sleep so I eat. But continuing these 3000 calorie days is destroying my progress. I was once 8 stone (as an adult male). Shot up to 16 stone in 2019, now at a reasonable 12 stone. If I don't curb this addiction once and for all, I'm going to end up in a bad way again. I'm so frustrated with the food industry and how they engineer this poison to be so addictive. I feel very helpless. Sometimes I'll fast for some days out of complete anger at it all, but that only leads to binges afterwards. I want to forge a healthy future but always, ALWAYS tumble backwards. Any advice? Have started cooking, and despite being pretty good at it, it's still just too easy to grab something unhealthy. I'm at my wits end. I can quit most things, just by simply avoiding it (smoking for example), but food is there everyday. It can't be avoided. It also boggles my mind that I know on a logical level NOT to eat bad or in excess but yet I still do it. It's like ""Just don't eat bad food or too much of it"" and yet I go ahead and do it anyway.",1638327193.0

I have traded one addiction and gone back to my old faithful addiction. Food. But I'm changing that. Down 25 pounds from my starting point. I'm doing kettlebell class, zumba with my wife, and walking on the off days. I may never be David Goggins, I don't aspire to be.

Eating 20,000 calories every single day instead of around 10,000 calories. My doctor was so alarmed with the rapid weight gain that he put me on vyvanse (albeit only the very lowest dose of 10mg) which seemed to only make me worse and more obsessive over food and eating as much as I can, as fast as I can. I'm just committing a slow form of suicide at this point.

It really dawned on me that food addiction might be my problem recently because I had literal painful stomach cramps but I was still ‚Äúhungry.‚Äù  I was boiling pasta, knowing that I would end up in more pain, yet for whatever reason, I HAD to eat.

I‚Äôm tired of the physical pain from overeating and the mental anguish I feel.  I‚Äôm tired of constantly thinking about food and my next meal.  Until recently- I thought all people did this!

I literally act like a drug addict towards it. My thoughts are constantly occupied by food, my brain always resorts to it for comfort, I get extremely irritated if I don't get the foods I want when I'm stressed, I plan food a lot, I fantasise about food a lot. 

People, including my therapist have told me that I must get better coping mechanisms to deal with stress that don't involve eating. And I've tried so hard. I've tried actually solving my problems (not good when there's literally nothing you can do about a problem), I walk for 2 hours a day, I try to do a little bit of stretching and situps etc., I've tried just laying in bed and watching Netflix.

But nothing works. My thoughts will still be completely occupied with the thing stressing me out or food. So I'll eat to escape the pain. And it doesn't even have to be junk food, I could literally binge on a series of mostly healthy foods. 

But junk food is on a whole other level. Each bite feels like heroine, and each swallow feels like heroine withdrawal, leaving me craving for more, unsatiated, but sick to the core. It's almost off-putting. Off-putting enough to make me avoid junk on most days, but not off-putting enough to stop me from bingeing and purging once a week. 

Now I can't purge anymore. I decided to take the gamble and start purging 2 months ago. I mostly feared tooth rot, but read how it really depends on genetics how soon teeth would start to decay. Well it happened really soon for me. So I can't purge anymore. And I'm just dreading how the only 2 choices I'll have is to either suffer through the cravings and the stress to the point of crying or sit with the mentally and physically sickening feeling of binged food in my system.

I watched a movie about drug addiction once and I remember this quote: ""Stop looking for the next best thing. There is no next best thing. You just need to accept life as it is, accept life without the high"".

And that's so hard for me to accept. It's so hard for me to accept a life that's generally miserable, that has little relief from that misery, and has no high. And I think there's really something wrong with my dopamine receptors, because other people have described so many things that give them a high or at least make them feel happy, including exercising, having a pet, socialising, partying etc. etc. etc. But food is the only thing that makes me feel even close to happy.",1637657678.0

My parents tried to raise me right by cooking healthy, discouraging snacking and exercising portion control. I would say perhaps they were too strict, as they cooked the exact same meals every week, which were many times too half-assed, over-cooked or undercooked. Of course it was the complete opposite at grandma's house, where I ate with no restriction, snacked all the time and ate whenever I wanted. This wasn't really a problem as I was active enough to retain a normal weight.

The problems started when my physical activity reduced, when I started having my own money, and when my parents started buying more junk. I had a lot of stress in my life and would get judged a lot for everything I did, which made me eat and binge in secret. In recent years I was also unknowingly suffering from moderate vitamin deficiencies which made me incredibly tired and not go out much. It was so bad at times that I would get out of breath just using the stairs in the house (at a BMI of 25 mind you).

Things really got out of hand when I spent a few months working in a hotel. My vitamin deficiencies made me want to eat more, as did the stress of the job. Combine that with the free leftover food around me for the entire work day and I had the most rapid weight gain in my life. And I knew that what I was doing was wrong, but I would literally think: ""Fuck my health right now. I'm working as many hours as I can and I don't care what I have to do to cope with that'.

When I left that job and tried to get back into healthy habits again, I found it nearly impossible with the amount of food in the house. My parents kept telling me that I was the problem, not the food. But by this point in time, even my parents and very active brother were starting to suffer from weight gain which they didn't in the past. In recent years even my grandma and my uncle suddenly started suffering from major weight gain which they didn't in the past because of how much cheap food they were buying and storing in the house. My personal problems with food eventually made my parents realise that their purchasing of foods was contributing to my weight problem and now their weight problem as well.

My main problem is when there's too much food at home, because it's in sight, and there's the problem of food wastage, which is basically wasting our money. My dad still has trouble acknowledging that he has a problem with buying too much junk food. He used junk food to try and make us and himself happy. Pre-2013 the most he would buy was a box of pastries on Sunday. But in recent years every week he'd go to the store and buy a massive cupboard's-worth of cheap chocolates and snack foods, which would totally not last the week. So he's had to bar himself from even entering large supermarkets. My mother also has a problem of cooking too much regular and healthy food.

What I'm really getting at are the questions: Don't food companies, food stores and doctors deserve some blame for the obesity epidemic? Doesn't the person's physical and family environment have some blame for their food choices? Experts have said that since obesity has reached all corners of the planet, all cultures and peoples, even our pets, then it's not about personal willpower. From the stuff going on in certain forums, it looks like eating-disordered behaviours, both on the part of binge-eating and anorexia/bulimia/orthorexia are literally affecting entire families simultaneously.

My country is currently proposing a tax on all junk foods. While I think that would help make a little dent in the problem, I agree with the criticisms that if there should be a junk food tax then the prices of healthy foods needs to come down too.  Because it's ridiculous that a pastry worth 500 calories can be as cheap as 30c when the cheapest that a salad can get is 6.80.",1636965554.0

When she is at home, she would open the fridge almost every half an hour. She would ask me what we should eat for breakfast/lunch/dinner every 2 hours, until I would just give in and grab a meal with her even when I'm not hungry at all. Just to stop her from asking about it. And after the meal, 30min later, she would go to the fridge and the cycle continues.

When we chat, she only wants to talk about food and absolutely nothing else. Nothing remotely close to a hobby. I know that when my mom was young, she loved dancing and ice skating and being active. She did indicate some interest in taking up square dancing but when I offered to get her started, she would brush it off. So it is mostly just a thought she'd entertain but that's about it. I know that people from my country as a whole can be quite enthusiastic about food given the wide variety, affordability etc, but my mom's on a totally different level. She doesn't want to do anything else but talk about food or eat. If I suggest that we go for a walk, try something fun like handicraft or dancing, she would dismiss it and see it as me trying to ""give her pressure"". So I don't even bring that up now.

I'm concerned for her health and also feel that she can do so much more with her free time if she is open minded enough to try new stuff that might give her more fulfilment that just food.

My question is, is this normal of people of her age, and what's the best approach to this? Also, my dad passed on many years ago so she doesn't have a companion or a social circle and has no interest to know people. She is also working and showing no signs of dementia.",1636896237.0

It's quite strange to actually feel physical hunger when I haven't for so long! I also thought I'd be craving my usuals (chocolates and takeaways) but surprisingly, I'm not. 

 I'm hoping this will eventually lead me to eat healthier, I don't really have a plan, I'm just hoping I can use this to get some motivation and confidence.",1636197863.0
Waking up at 2am craving for food,10,qnuhdm,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/qnuhdm/waking_up_at_2am_craving_for_food/,2,"You know that extreme thirst your experience when you wake after a night of drinking? Well imagine the equivalent but in hunger.

For the past month I‚Äôve been waking up at 2am (two or three times a week) craving for food. Sometimes I would just eat a few carrot sticks with peanut butter, other times I would finish the entire left overs from the Thanksgiving dinner.

To my knowledge, there hasn‚Äôt been any significant change to my lifestyle that could justify this erratic behavior.

The two theories that I‚Äôve come up with are:
- I just moved to North America and it‚Äôs the first time that I‚Äôm experiencing ‚Äòcold‚Äô weather so my body isn‚Äôt use to it and burning calories way too quickly
- Hidden stress from university

We lost power because there was an EF3 tornado ripping through our city. My parents were busy getting us to a safe space, but all I could think about was how upset I was that I probably wasn't going to get to eat my pizza rolls.

what‚Äôs your attachment style?,3,qm6xfm,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/qm6xfm/whats_your_attachment_style/,0,"I suspect that attachment style has an association with food addiction, mine is disorganized.

Secure: Easy to open up to someone, values time and hobbies outside of dating life, looks forward to building intimacy with matches.

Anxious-preoccupied: Constantly worried you‚Äôre not good enough for your match, looking for a partner to feel complete, feeling possessive over someone‚Äôs time.

Dismissive-avoidant: Has trouble getting close with others, comes across as emotionally unavailable to matches, distances themselves when things get difficult.

Fearful-avoidant: Very much looking for  companionship but also scared to commit, can run hot and cold with a match, often overwhelmed by feelings.

(Reposted this because I left out a poll option last time)

EDIT: interesting that more than half of the results are anxious-preoccupied, in the standard pop we would expect avoidant and anxious to have an about equal distribution. The fearful results are also fairly significant though they don‚Äôt look like much, that‚Äôs because in the general pop they only make up 5%, but in these results they make up almost 20%. That said, the sample size is too small to make any conclusive statement. It could be that avoidant people are less likely to look to support groups for help. One thing that does seem apparent is that food addiction is negatively correlated with a secure attachment (this has been shown by other studies), which I think is fascinating because it could suggest our attachment style does not only describe our relationships with people, but also with things like food. For ppl that had bad experiences in childhood, we may emulate those in adulthood, we subconsciously seek our things that hurt us. TRIGGER WARNING: self-harm. I considered that addiction to food might be a covert form of self-harm, but that‚Äôs just speculation. Ppl with BPD regulate their emotions through self-harm, this can be through food restriction, physically hurting themselves, or drugs. Interestingly, it has been shown that if they get better in one of these areas, then the other 2 get progressively worse (source: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TJ9sb2zmw) <‚Äî very interesting video!

Am I Addicted Or Am I Just Bored?,6,qivi59,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/qivi59/am_i_addicted_or_am_i_just_bored/,5,"Hey guys, new to this Sub so if this isn't the right thing to be saying on here really sorry üòÖ

Anyway,

For the last Maybe 3 or 4 months I've noticed my food intake is.... abnormal? I used to be pretty well structured when I ate. You know I'd have my breakfast, some morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner (never really was a big desert guy) and the meals and snack I had were I guess relatively healthy you know, breakfast was something like avocado on toast with some tomatoes and lunch was chicken and rice with some Veges and dinner was a steak and some Veges or a fillet of fish. You know nothing amazing but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Now before I go further I should probably say - in....August? Or early September my country (New Zealand) had gone back into a lockdown so... I guess I got pretty late about the way I ate? What I mean was I wasn't so conscious about what or how much I was consuming in a day. I started making alot of homemade pizzas, or alot of new pasta dishes, whatever really (I do enjoy being in the kitchen I guess) but as I started making these things and what.not, I noticed some things. 

When I was making dough for pizzas there was enough for 2 or 3 pizzas.. so I'd end up making how ever many and eating them all in the same sitting? And things like pasta, i would make alot more than what a single man would need so again - I'd scoff the whole bloody thing down and these weren't small amounts at all. 

So that had been going on for about a month or so. And then our restrictions of lockdowns had raised by 1 level. Which meant uber eats was back up and running. And this is where it sort of leads up to right now, I'll be laying in bed and order something from a pizza place... then not even 2 hours go by and I'm ordering a 12 box of donuts, then another 2 or 3 hours go by and I'm getting McDonald's. And while all this is happening I'm well aware that 1. This food Is not in the slightest good for me and 2. It's making a huge impact on my weekly Income it's ridiculous. I've tried deleting the app but it's so easy to just re install and get back into ordering shit from them. On top of that it's not hard to get in the car and go to the drive through üòÖ 

I currently weigh something like 87 or 89.. shit honestly it could be bloody 90kg now I'm not sure (not that that's stupidly overweight but 1. I was 78 before lockdown and 2. I can definitely see this habit going pair shaped.üôÉ.

Im still really not sure if I'm just fueling an addiction for food or I'm just incredibly bored so all I want to do is eat food. I'm on the addiction side of things, but I could be wrong. 

Anyone else have something similar they're going through / been through?

I've tried so many techniques to correct my behaviour but just keep breaking all the rules. Some people might say not to worry so much about a day or two of extremely unhealthy eating, but what if it goes on for days or even weeks? The conventional dietary and addiction advice just hasn't worked on me. I'm just at a loss.

* 'Eat small portions'. Tried that, I still just end up taking 'small portions' of every single thing I can find until I'm so stuffed I can barely move.
* 'Eat until you're satisfied'. There's no such thing as satisfaction for me. I don't eat out of hunger but out of emotion. Even when I'm completely stuffed or focusing on something else I'll get an unsatiable craving for processed carbs.
* 'Don't keep trigger foods in the house, don't buy junk food'. I don't think I need to explain that this is impossible for anyone who doesn't live alone.
* 'Plan your lunch for the next day'. That works just fine except that with every day comes a different intense craving. I could have been feeling like nuts and salad the previous day, but the next day I crave something else and will still crave that thing despite eating my nuts and salad. And because the craving doesn't go away I'll eat both of those things and more than I originally planned.
* 'Don't have junk food'. I can be surrounded by the healthiest foods in the world and my brain will still make me absolutely binge on them. Seriously, what can I possibly do when I'm even bingeing on SALAD??
* I started doing fasting at the beginning of this year, and it might have actually triggered more bingeing behaviour.

I relate to literally every symptom and narrative or food addiction. Food is like my drug. If I don't have the food I'm craving TODAY I feel like the colour has gone from this world. Nearly every bite of food (mostly junk food but even moderately healthy food does this to me), feels like pure happiness to me. Nothing else in life ever makes me feel like eating does. I've tried so many things including medication for my depression, getting new friends, getting new hobbies, hiking, therapy, listening to music, all the diet-related rules in the universe.

I suffer from a multitude of other illnesses that are weight based, as well as immune based, and mental based. I'm really hopeless in this struggle. No one understands it.

I'm tired of trying sometimes... But I know I have to or else I will get diabetes and gain more weight, which I can't do. I want to be healthy. I want to be better.

I keep saying ""Next week I will do it, tomorrow I can, etc."" but I'm tired of doing this. I want to just be normal. I don't want to associate food with happiness. I don't want to associate food with bad AND good feelings, I don't want to cry anymore because I know just how long of my life I wasted hating my body and how long I might not even have left because I ruined it.

A message of hope for those feeling hopeless‚Ä¶.,9,qcpfhc,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/qcpfhc/a_message_of_hope_for_those_feeling_hopeless/,13," I've had a lifetime struggle with food. It gives me ease and comfort & I use and abuse it. I try compensatory methods to then control my weight - excessive exercise, restrict, etc. I sometimes wake up and my first thoughts are on food or I dream about food. I'd have thoughts of eating a particular something when i wasn't even hungry. I'd want to just ""munch/eat"" something when anxious and wanting to avoid facing life/reality/my uncomfortable feelings. My closet was full of various sizes because my weight was always a moving target. It was a vicious cycle of using food to feel better - feeling awful afterwards, swearing off and coming up with a new plan to eat healthy, I'd have great results for a time, eventually I'd compulsively eat, after i was baffled how could i do this yet again. All the self-knowledge of nutrition & strategies to eat right and exercise didn't work. All the years of ED disorder therapy didn't work. I tried umpteen other things: popular weigh & pay programs, intuitive eating, other forms of talk therapy, hypnosis, various healing energy modalities, positive intentions/affirmations, metaphysical means like healing crystals, on and on. What did all this experience show me? That I'm screwed between the ears when it comes to managing my eating and my weight. Sure i could power through and have great results for a time (people would think I had surgery because of how different I looked) overtime, however I'd eventually go back to my compulsive eating behaviors. Finally, when I realized I was out of options and baffled I tried the last house on the block, a 12-step program for my compulsive eating problem. In the rooms i heard people share and I realized i wasn't alone in how I used food to feel better yet my mind and behavior with it was overtaking & ruining my life. I was plagued with thoughts on what to eat, oh, no i can't eat that,  ok, how do i avoid eating that because if I start I‚Äôll eat too much, controlling ingredients‚Ä¶. then overeating and eventually compulsively eating. The big book of AA as adapted for my problem says I have a mind that is unmanageable. I can't ‚Äúmanage the decision‚Äù to stop compulsively eating for good and all. How did I know this? My experience proved it. I could have all the reasons to stop (serious health reasons, self-knowledge about myself & exploring ‚Äúwhy I eat‚Äù through therapy, self-knowledge of nutrition & exercise strategies, job expectations to model good health, etc) was that enough to stop me for good and all - Nope!

I got free from my constant obsessive thoughts around food, eating and weight by joining a 12-step program for compulsive eating. I got a sponsor and worked the steps. By doing that I am now free from compulsive food thoughts and the insane behaviors that would follow. Now, I get freedom from that barrage of food thoughts and weight obsession. Now i have a different way of dealing with life. Rather than turning to the food I turn to the steps, but i had to do the work and get through the steps to be able to start living life that way. I am a gratefully recovered compulsive eater and sponsor. I am happy to share more on my experience for those interested.",1634814857.0

Binging has plagued my life for a couple of years now. While I knew it was related to my anxiety, I couldn't quite find a way to resist. I would stay strong for a week or two, and then binge during some random night whenever I was worried about something in my life (work, family, etc.) I can finally say with some confidence that I am noticing some consistent improvement. I haven't binged for 2 months (which for me is quite the achievement), and I haven't felt better about my relationship with food in years.

I'm a 28 male who's overweight. I've dealt with depression and anxiety for 9 years now. 

A problem I'm having is using sugar, snacks and junk food as a coping mechanism to feel better and fill that void. Food and snacks just make me feel happy, warm inside, gives me a reason to get out of bed and something to look forward to. But it's making me gain more and more weight. If I continue like this I'm probably gonna end up with type 2 diabetes and other weight related health problems. But food and sugar is one of my main joys in life. Nothing else beats it. If I never got full, I could just eat, eat and eat. I don't know how I could motivate myself to live without it.

In short, I guess you could say I'm a food addict and have a very unhealthy relationship to food and snacks.

Did you manage to stop being addicted? How do you fill that void without food and keep the motivation up?

Every single day it felt like death was inevitable because I couldn't stop binging.  I tried anything and everything.  I joined a 12 Step program to no avail.  When I say I was hopeless I really mean it.  I would cry because no one understood. Society told me I was a failure due to my lack of will power, that's exactly how I felt.  I wasn't strong enough to not eat an entire bag of chips or cookies.  Rarely had left overs from a meal.  I attended a clinic for binge eating disorders.  These people understood that it wasn't a lack of will power.  They didn't treat me like some obese blemish on the image of what is acceptable.  They were kind, yet assertive.  They made me face my fears,  my demons, and my insecurities.  They didn't shame me, but instead they stood behind me while I made progress week after week. I started in June and by August I was in a different place completely.  The reason I say there is hope is because I  have it. Not just for me anymore. I have hope that everyone here is capable of recovery. The cure to binge eating isn't control or restrictive eating. It's  self love, being kind to yourself, giving your body proper nutrition, and understanding that your life is worth more than a scale number. I feel like me again now that I don't see food as the enemy.  No such thing as good food or bad food either.  I tossed out all the negative things I had learned to make room for growth.

After a month or two of struggling through treatment, things got really good. I was actually happy and getting things back in my life that I thought I had given up on a long time ago. Now, seven months in ‚Äî while I appreciate how far I‚Äôve come ‚Äî some of the luster has worn off and being sober has gotten kind of normal. The so-called ‚Äòpink cloud‚Äô has come and gone.

Food has *always* been a problem for me and was arguably my first addiction. In a way, overeating and the resulting a lot of the guilt and shame about myself led to, and exacerbated, my drug use.

Early in treatment, life is really easy. They tell you where to be, what to do, and how to do it. Personal accountability is very low. Now, seven months on, I‚Äôve progressed to a point where the accountability is to myself and not facilitators at a rehab. I was, at one point, a semester into medical school before pills switched to heroin and my life stopped all together. I‚Äôm working as a nursing assistant now and starting nursing school in January. Things are actually coming together, but I‚Äôm starting to see those old addict tendencies come out with my eating habits.

I‚Äôve lost over 60 pounds since I got clean. I‚Äôve worked my ass off in the gym. But that weight loss has started to plateau because of my habits. I‚Äôm hiding what I eat, I‚Äôm binge eating, I‚Äôm spending wayyy more money than I should, I‚Äôm making excuses, I‚Äôm being dishonest with people I care about. Sure, I‚Äôm not putting a needle in my arm, but that addict behavior is there. 

Being in recovery is stressful at times. Living in sober living is stressful. Watching people that I‚Äôve really bonded with in treatment struggle and go back out (and, with a few, lose their battle with addiction) is stressful. Even though I chose to, working in a hospital during COVID is fucking stressful. They‚Äôre real stressors, but they‚Äôre also excuses. I‚Äôm not the only person in the world going through something, we all do.

What‚Äôs crazy is that I‚Äôd rather admit to being a heroin addict than a food addict because admitting that I‚Äôm a food addict somehow makes all of the negative thoughts about myself real. I can tell someone about shooting dope or stealing from my family because when I was doing those things ‚Äòit wasn‚Äôt me, it was my addiction. I‚Äôm not that person‚Äô. But talking about eating, I feel like that‚Äôs really me. That‚Äôs the raw, fucking painful shit. That‚Äôs the man in the mirror. It‚Äôs the problem that was there before drugs and it‚Äôs the problem that still there now that drugs are gone.

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this. I guess I just needed to put it out into the universe.,

Yes, I have eaten clean for months and completely,  longer than 6-12 months,  yes it does get easier but I am never trully satisfied. And eventually I eat something ""normal"" and I fall. It takes up so much of my mental space I hate it. I am only a bit overweight but I am very worried about the sugar and too much food consumption.  What I am interested in, what do you think it causes it outside of generic advice (be abstinent and the cravings stop - they don't, it is candida -tried that, plant-based or meat based or anything based diets -tried it all, etc)

I know that sugar and junk is addictive. But I know people, in fact it seems I'm surrounded by them, who don't have this obbsession. Sure, they like cake or pizza. Sure, some of them are slightly overweight, some aren't. But they are not thinking about food so often (I asked), they don't have the need to eat so often (I can see it and I asked), they can go hours without thinking about food. Some people don't have appetite at all. Some people eat a dessert or piece of junk and don't need to eat another and another 90mins later.

What is it? These people are not neccessarily wiser or more put together or more psychologically balanced. I am sure they have their childhood scars. Why? Are they more interested in life than eating?  Is appetite the same as libido, are you born with it?

I would give anything to be rid of this need so I could focus on something else. I have so many theories. Maybe I don't want to focus on life so this is avoidant thing. I can tell myself many times but it works only to a degree.

My health and quality of life is suffering and Every attempt to change over the last 10+ years has failed. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I over did it on pizza last night, not the first time. Woke up at 2:00 am with an awful flare up of IBS-D and was dry heaving at the same tome. This is not the first time this has happened, but I haven‚Äôt gotten that sick from overeating in a while.

I knew the whole time eating it I should stop. I know I over do it on carbs and it‚Äôs not what I need to be doing. I was doing my best to practice mindfulness. I knew I was going to be sick but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to stop.

My weight has been out of control for over a decade, but especially the last 18 months. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0‚Äù, 315 lbs. and can‚Äôt physically do what I want anymore. For my size, I am fairly athletic, and it‚Äôs almost like a party trick. I call it Chris Farley disease. 

It hurts to play on the floor with my kids. I play ice hockey every week and it‚Äôs a physical nightmare I am starting to resent rather than enjoy. Even working around the house and yard is getting exhausting. I‚Äôve had three knee scopes and my lower back is in constant pain from the excess weight. My stamina is gone and my physical strength is weakening. Overall, I don‚Äôt have a lot of weight related health issues aside from a slightly high liver enzyme count and sleep apnea, which I suspect I have had since high school when I was in great physical shape and playing sports. It was less severe, but still there.

My next meal is an all consuming thought process. It‚Äôs like there are not enough distractions to keep me from feeling the urge to go and eat everything that looks good or tasty in the house. I know it‚Äôs bad, I tell myself I don‚Äôt want it, I try to distract myself with other things, but I‚Äôm the end I usually end up giving in. It keeps me up at night thinking about food and what I could be enjoying. I can‚Äôt eliminate everything good from the house because my wife and kids need to be able to have food. It‚Äôs expensive, time consuming, and destroying my self esteem and personal self worth. I‚Äôm grossed out with my appearance and behavior everyday, yet I still cannot stop myself. When I am able to eat responsibly, I become extremely irritable and difficult for other to be around me. Everything else in my life suffers because of this fucking disease.

I‚Äôve tried so many things. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years. I finally got an ADHD diagnosis and have been managing that with medication and more therapy. I tried working out more, but it just makes food cravings more intense. I‚Äôve done anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. I thought about starting smoking or drinking again to take the place of eating, but that feels like they would be worse addictions. Everyone I‚Äôve known who take diet pills have gained more than they lost when they had to stop. I want to try bariatric surgery, but I think my issue is more mental and I am scared I can‚Äôt make the changes needed to keep the weight off.

Family history of addiction.,9,pxsgdf,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/pxsgdf/family_history_of_addiction/,5,"This is probably a subject that's been covered a lot on this sub but wanted to talk about my own family and hear from other people about theirs.

My family has a history of addiction, my father spent a good chunk of his youth in foster care because my grandmother was an alcoholic. She spent the last 10 years of her life in a carehome with alcohol induced dementia alone and confused. 

My dad and his brother both grew up to be binge drinkers, spending weeks on end drunk then going sober for a month or two before going on another bender. Rinse repeat for my entire childhood. My dad has in recent years gotten sober which im happy about, he is doing well. 

Although my uncle hasn't and is now showing similar memory problems that my grandmother had.

3 of my cousins became heroin addicts, one is now clean and works with rehab groups after spending time in prison. The other 2 are still using. Both  have children who have been put in foster care.

I have never been a big drinker, because of my family history I saw no appeal in drinking. I maybe have a drink twice a year on special occasions.

I used to hate my dad for being so weak and giving in to his addiction every other month. He was an embarrassment to me when I was young and I was actually happy when my parents split up. I avoided drink so I would never end up like him

For the longest time I thought because I dont drink or do much drugs that I was making sure I didn't end up with any addictive behaviour. But as you can probably guess my addiction ended up being something I didn't even see as a possible source of addiction, i.e food/sugar. 

Today I reached 340lbs, the highest ive ever been and its got me in a depressed mood. for the past 10 years I have pretty much always been either just about to start a diet or in that period where I have recently given up on one. I drink about 2 litres of coke a day and eat a stupid amount of chocolaty snacks. I spend 90% of my money on food, I eat takeaways every other night despite the fact that every time I eat one I say to myself ""thats the last one.""

I am grateful that I've avoided alcohol and drug addiction but I  definitely did not avoid addiction in general.

My biggest fear is not that I'll end up like my grandmother, confused and alone due to drink but that I will end up housebound and alone, living only to eat with no companionship, dying early at age 60 from heart failure due to my own actions. Never having lived a full life, no excitement, no adventure and no love. 

Im ashamed of how I look and am already aware of how much I have retreated from society. I go to work then I go home, every now and then I visit family but thats it. Even visiting family has become hard because its obvious to anyone how much weight I have gained and how unhappy with it I am. 

The idea of going on a date is unthinkable I could never feel comfortable being close with someone looking they way I do, even if I found someone who wanted to be with me. 

Im scared of what the future holds for me and even that fear is not enough to stop my compulsive eating.

I have a better understanding of how my dad gave into his addictions now because Im doing the same thing every day.

I'm curious how common family history of addiction is amongst people with eating problems.",1632910916.0

I got a bunch of new cookware, appliances, ingredients, and spices. I also subscribed to a couple food podcasts, followed a handful of IG food accounts, and dozens of cooking/food YouTube channels. 

Before this point I would eat more vegetables and healthy in general. Nowadays, I‚Äôm consuming 20x more food related media content than before and thus I‚Äôve gained 17lbs since 2020 but can‚Äôt counteract/eliminate the root cause with exercise alone. 

When I watch/listen to them it makes me want to try and make that dish or sample a certain cuisine. It is tough because I enjoy making new things in the videos I watch or go out and try the dish at a restaurant. My creativity wants to come out but there is no restraint on the health implications during this time. It‚Äôs all about taste and that feel good endorphin. 

I believe that eating food as escalated from a need to a want and my new want has become more connected to my brain receptors. I now feel dependent. 

I struggle every day to eat/cook healthy but they are overruled in my head 9 times out of 10. 

I know that cutting out this cooking/food media will help but it will affect my creativity, fun, and interest in the culinary world. I‚Äôm willing to take the step but don‚Äôt know how. 

Has anyone been in my shoes?

Thanks in advance!",1632829254.0

I don't know if this is the right place for me,16,prh03c,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/prh03c/i_dont_know_if_this_is_the_right_place_for_me/,1,"Hi everyone,

I don't know if this is the right place for me, but I don't know where else to post. I have an appointment with my counsellor for Friday, but this is the first time I've really put it all together and I don't know what to do and it feels so shitty. I feel so alone in it.

*TL;DR* I have binge-eating disorder (and ADHD and PTSD), a history of anorexia nervosa, but I absolutely hate food. I can't stand preparing food, eating food, being hungry, so I avoid eating. I don't eat and don't eat and don't eat then I binge on crap food because I'm so absurdly hungry. I hate food even more for the fact that I feel hunger and can no longer withstand it the way I once did when I had anorexia. I also binge on sweets when I am experiencing emotions I have difficulty having, such as feelings of failure and shame, but that's easier to deal with because my husband hides that kind of food by my request. 

My story:

I grew up in poverty as the older of the two children of immigrants. I came here with my parents when I was 3, and my sister was born here when I was 5. I don't really have any conscious memories of anywhere else, sometimes a flash but not anything tangible and not anything that I can even be sure is a real memory. My dad had to travel a lot for work, my sister was born premature and had eating and digestive difficulties, and my mum has borderline personality disorder. She's a wonderful, good person, but she is emotionally somewhere between 13 and 15. In times of stress, she can regress to a younger emotional age. She had a lot on her plate and no resources (financial, emotional, community) to draw on. 

With my dad bouncing between having work sometimes and welfare, and my mum barely speaking any English, we had very little money. I remember my sister being a baby, so I'd have been 5 or 6, and already knowing that my mum felt awful for not being able to provide for us. I knew that me wanting anything she couldn't give me would cause her immense distress, not only things like food or toys but also attention and comfort. If she couldn't meet my needs, she would often fall apart. I learned quickly to never go to my parents with any of my struggles, and to especially not have needs. I disavowed them.

Often, little me really didn't like the food my mum made me for lunches at school. She'd make me a little sandwich with just peppers, for example, or thinly sliced cucumber. I felt so guilty though, not wanting to eat those, especially when she'd frequently tell me to be thankful I have any food at all because some people have none, so I'd hide them around the classroom. I couldn't bring myself to throw them away, but if I hid them, then it wasn't so bad, right? **I** wasn't so bad. But I knew I had wasted that food, food we could barely afford, and so I'd punish myself for that by pretending to not be hungry at dinner so that I would ""save"" my parents money in payment for having ""wasted"" it by not eating the sandwich.  I felt such shame. I still feel such shame and anguish.

I just realised yesterday that of all the needs I had that I disavowed -- the need for comfort, attunement, attachment security, touch, safety -- the one need I cannot actually disavow is the need for food. I have lived most of my life completely cut off from any of my needs for connection or love or other people (I've only been learning how to get in tune with those needs for the last maybe year and a half?), but hunger is always there. So every single time I feel hungry, every time that I eat, I feel rage and hatred.

I revile food. I seethe at the thought of food. I think it bears all the rage I feel from childhood for not having my needs met and being neglected. Instead of being angry at my parents or life or shit in the world, I am angry at hunger and at food. Hunger makes me vulnerable. I cannot conquer hunger. I cannot control it. I am and always have been at its mercy. 

And so here I sit, eating a mint Aero bar because that'll give me a bit of energy, and briefly mask the shame with sugar.",1632087157.0

I Am a Food Addict,14,pqyhe0,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/pqyhe0/i_am_a_food_addict/,4,"I am a food addict.

Food addiction is an unnoticeable disease. Because eating is good for you, right? We are usually encouraged to eat. We need nutrition,¬†it's important for our bodies. It helps us become stronger physically and mentally. Get in your three square meals a day. We are also set in a society that uses food for every special occasion. Birthdays, holidays, even getting a promotion at work, you go out and celebrate with a big full meal. No one will ever tell you to stop eating. Because food is survival.

But no one ever notices when you go for that second helping. No one says anything when you grab the biggest piece of cake. It's not common for people to be¬†concerned for you when you've had a hard week and you decide to binge eat the night away. Because food is survival.¬†

Sadly, the awareness of food addiction is just not common.

However, if you are aware of your unhealthy relationship with food, than you are well on your way to improving your quality of life. Being aware is hard to notice and here are the things that I've become aware of about myself.

1. I constantly have to tell myself no to food.It's all about being a mindful eater. Being aware of your body and if it's telling you its full or if it's telling you it needs more. If I am not mindful and think before popping food in my mouth, I can easily continue to snack away.
2. I am an emotional eater.I want to eat when I'm mad, sad, annoyed, frustrated, stressed, tired, even sometimes when I'm happy.¬† Food is comforting to me and if eating until I¬†am stuffed¬†makes me feel relaxed and comfortable, I'll do it.¬†
3. Do I even care about myself?The answer is no. Because I'm feeding myself the wrong things to handle my problems. Self love is a whole other topic but at the end of the day, when I binge, I am damaging myself and in those moments I have no self-respect. I am allowing myself to harm my body since I am fully aware of difference between a McDonald's cheese burger and a salad full of whole foods.¬†
4. No self-control.Like the first point and back to mindless eating, I can easily not give a shit and not even say the word ""stop"" when I'm binge eating. I can even eat until I'm full and put my plate to the side, but five minutes later when the stomach pain goes away, I'm back at it.¬† ¬†

Living with an addiction to food is hard. It's something I think I will always struggle with because I live¬†to be comfortable. It's important to¬†embrace feeling uncomfortable and remembering the benefits behind it. Another thing is of course, being aware of my tendencies. Knowing all these reasons¬†why I love food more than myself is a huge eye opener and helps me think before I eat.¬†Obviously, there will be imperfect days, but it's all apart of this crazy, chaotic life and how to navigate through it all.¬†

I hope this helps shine some light on¬†either yourself or someone you love. Bringing this awareness might help someone else work through some of their internal struggles and motivate some changes.

Keep up the positivity and hard work. You are learning and evolving and I'm proud of you.",1632013987.0

Emotional Neglect and Comfort Eating,23,pokr96,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/pokr96/emotional_neglect_and_comfort_eating/,6,"I realised after a buttload of therapy that what I believed to be a perfect idyllic childhood was in fact full of emotional neglect and consequential comfort eating.

Eating is what my family does. In good times, bad times, through sickness and health, we eat. A lot. Food was the answer to every situation. Bad day at school? Eat. Good report card? Eat. Rather than talk about feelings when I was angry or frustrated, protocol was to go to my room and be alone until I felt better, then be rewarded with some chocolate or chips. At the same time, I vividly remember being criticised for how much I ate, and feeling an enormous sense of comfort from eating in secret where I could indulge as much as I wanted and no one could tell me I was bad for it.

And now, I'm a depressed, anxious, obese adult and it doesn't seem to matter how much I eat, I crave food constantly. But realising that my food issues were, in fact, NOT because of something fundamentally wrong with me or my character, but in fact the result of emotional neglect and trauma, for maybe the first time ever I feel an inkling of hope that maybe life can be different.

Can anyone else relate to having these kinds of epiphanies?

Learning that I'm addicted to food,4,poi69x,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/poi69x/learning_that_im_addicted_to_food/,8,"I have been overweight since before puberty, due to a medication I was forced to take when I was younger. I have always been obsessed with food, especially sugary foods, even at that young age. I eat things like hamburger helper, kraft mac n cheese, chef boyardi, reeses, any chocolate or sweet bread type food, chicken tenders... basically, if a 5 year old will eat it, I love it.

Anyway, I'm an obese and diabetic adult. I have looked at myself critically, and I can say that while I've never just let myself go and not TRIED to eat right, all my efforts have failed due to being weak willed. I grew up poor and was lucky to eat anything at all some days. I think I've learned to depend on food to make me feel better, and this has lead to what I can honestly classify as an addiction.

My two best friends have staged an intervention and come up with a diet plan for me, which is literally just meat, fruit, and vegetables. 3 carefully portioned meals plus 1 snack per day.  

I know the plan will work, and I know I'll lose weight and feel better, and be healthier. I understand that I have a food addiction and that my feelings in this matter are probably irrational, and that's why I'm under a throwaway account to vent. I'm too ashamed to actually complain about it under my own username, because I'm just disgusted with myself. 

My feelings are basically this. I am deeply upset that I have an addiction, and also equally upset that I'm now being watched and controlled by other people. If possible, I'm even more upset that those same people are absolutely going to be eating fast food in front of me. I understand that we are all adults and they can eat what they want, but I feel resentful that they're going to judge me for wanting to eat the same thing. Even though I know they're doing this out of love and concern for my health. I feel selfish and disgusting for resenting them for trying to help me.

The second thing is diet soda. We all drink it. They mentioned I would have to give it up, and at that point I felt that was unfair. I told them that if diet soda is bad for me, it's bad for everyone, and it's not just because I'm diabetic, it's because it's a bad thing to drink. I said we should all do it. They basically explained that they agreed with me, but that they didn't want their failure to stop to influence me, i.e. ""she screwed up and had a soda, therefore I deserve one as well"". 

I understand that it is irrational to expect other people to go without if I am going without, I know that intellectually I am being childish, and it makes me ashamed of myself. But my feelings will NOT go away. I just want to scream that it's unfair, and when they eat fast food in front of me I want to cry. I hate them a little, and I hate myself a lot. After realizing I have an addiction, I feel like my life has flipped upside down and that I have no control. Whenever I sit here, hungry but unable to eat until this or that meal, I feel angry and sad and resentful. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience that they can share with me? Or any advice that might make me feel better?

 It's just a cycle of negativity and I can't seem to stop screaming UNFAIR in my head like a child, especially regarding the diet soda. It's going to be torture to drink plain water (they are wanting me to give up ALL sugar alternatives) while they pop open a nice cold can of soda.",1631676637.0

I know ultimately it is on me to conquer this and find my own way, but I wanted to vent to someone that would understand, and I'm hoping this thread is that place.

I was really struggling up until a couple of weeks ago. I would snack on anything and everything; I would go to the shop just for snacks whenever my flatmate was out; I would hide food; I would make two portions of food, save one and eat one and then give in and eat the other one later that night. 

But recently, my life has took a turn for the better. Without giving specifics - my life is not just about me anymore. I haven‚Äôt even thought about food in that way, as I‚Äôm so focused on other things, and I‚Äôm generally happier. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say, though it may not help everyone, is that maybe it‚Äôs not about only food, maybe if other parts of your life can improve, overcoming food addiction could be a good side effect.

My relationship with food is not normal and nobody takes it seriously.,53,p4xexm,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/p4xexm/my_relationship_with_food_is_not_normal_and/,7,"This was such a harsh realisation to accept.

Normal people do not think about food 24/7 or what they're gonna eat tomorrow or the day after or that get-together a whole month away. Normal people do not impulsively snack all the time no matter what. Normal people do not keep on eating after they're full. Normal people feel satisfied when they're full. Normal people do not continue eating when they have an upset stomach. Normal people do not continue eating normally when they have gut issues. Normal people do not continue eating foods that are known to upset them.

I've suffered from depression since childhood. Over the years I tried so many things to combat it: Therapy, medications, exercise, making new friends, trying new hobbies, trying new jobs. But nothing really sticks, nothing ever really lifts my spirits, and nothing has provided me with consistent joy like food. It's like every single thing on earth is dull compared to those few seconds when food tastes good. Food feels so good that if I eat with another person or eat with distractions around, my brain doesn't even register it properly and my cravings remain unsatisfied.

So I will always be addicted to food in some way, which means I have to live with it. I've tried managing my unhealthy relationship with food through dieting, fasting, whatever. I never realised just how addicted I was until I started working in catering. It brought out the worst in my eating habits.

I think I am addicted to food and my parents just judge me for it.,17,p2i5mi,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/p2i5mi/i_think_i_am_addicted_to_food_and_my_parents_just/,9,"My mother says that since I was a baby I've always had a big appetite. My parents tried to raise me right by keeping reasonable portions and cooking 'healthy' food. Unfortunately it was my mother cooking food most of the time and it sucked. She literally cooked the same foods and same recipes every week with no variation because she actually hated cooking. The food was also bland and unseasoned, meat always tough and dry, and some of the food even turned out undercooked or burnt because of her lack of patience.

As a result, I really loved grandma's food, which was all processed and unhealthy. At home I hated the 'healthy' food we had and loved grandma's unhealthy food, and she let me eat without restriction. So as long as I can remember I've always been a huge snacker. When I was more independent I would many times not even eat the main meals and just snack a lot.

Food is also one of the only things that make me happy. I've been struggling with depression since childhood and food has just always been there for me.

I overeat constantly and I'm always feeling bloated, tired, sick. I regularly suffer from indigestion, acid reflux, upset stomach etc. It's made me miss a few shifts at work. And I still can't stop myself.

Trying to stick to 4 main meals a day doesn't work because I'm an impulsive snacker.

The past year has really opened my eyes as to how addicted to food I really am. I've had more digestive issues over the past year where the cause has not been determined. Even though the cause isn't known, the rational thing to do with a chronically upset system is to detox a bit right? A simple diet of bread, rice, crackers and lemonade right? Well I had to overdo even that. I overeat on these simple starches and tried to find any way I could to flavor them.

The only thing that has worked to reduce the eating problem is fasting. I did it successfully for a few months, 20 hours every day. I lost weight, my cravings went away, and I felt super. But then I started working in a 4-star hotel, where leftover food was always in front of me and people were offering food to me constantly. I've tried every tactic in the book to avoid eating so much at work but fail every time.

Personally I have no problem avoiding buying junk food (cause it's out of my own pocket lol), and I can control myself somewhat with the food in the house. But I absolutely cannot resist 4-star hotel food being pushed on me for 8 hours that's gonna be chucked into the bin and wasted.

My parents are (rightfully) disgusted and mortified by how much I'm eating despite the bad consequences on my body. But I really can't stop it a lot of the time and they just judge me for it. They say I'm blaming everything but myself. There were periods where I was definitely suffering from an electrolyte imbalance or something (I'm anemic), and as a result I had INTENSE cravings for salt and watery things which made me absolutely binge on salty things and fruit without feeling satisfied. Vitamin pills greatly reduced the cravings, so it really wasn't something I could control.

In the meantime, I'm resorting to something really desperate to control my eating at work: chugging 2 diet drinks like some of my skinny colleagues.",1628704032.0

One is eat to live don't live to eat.  Im in the USA and we love our food here.  Friday night is where you going to eat?  So realize I am eating simply for energy and I find other things to do on a Friday night or find a purpose to live other than food.

Also avoid all or nothing thinking.  I don't have to eat 100% perfect and I can find a good balance for handling my cravings.  One is when I have a sugar need I either do the zero cal zero sugar powder drinks from wal mart or I do the lime juice extract with water and splenda and make something that tastes like a melted popsicle that has zero cal and zero sguar.  Or I take 2 tablespoons of salad dressing and dip spinach leaves in there and drink diet pepsi and have zero sugar BBQ sauce with white chicken breast.  All this eases the cravings.

I'm a 37-year-old male with ADHD who has a long history of trauma. I've endured sexual, physical, and mental abuse most of my life, even into adulthood. Both of my parents were more into drugs and partying than taking care of their kids, so there was also a lot of neglect, moving between my (divorced) parents and into different school systems, so I could never keep friends. I couldn't keep up with school. It's been a really difficult life.

Now, I'm doing fairly well. Excelling at work. I FINALLY seem to have my life in order. I've had to figure everything out on my own. The problem is, I'm 650 pounds and I have a food addiction. There are times I do really well. Before Covid hit, I had lost over 200 pounds, but once Covid hit, we couldn't even go to the grocery store, so we relied on fast food, which got me back into my old eating habits and I gained nearly 150 pounds of that back. 

Other times in my life I've had moments of success losing the weight, but I've come to realize that the trauma is what's lurking in the darkness and keeping me from tackling this forever. Food was the way I coped with everything. It made me feel good. I've never had a real girlfriend or relationship. I feel lonely. I get stressed easily because of my ADHD, so food always helps me calm down. I use food to celebrate. I use food to mourn. I use food when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, when I'm tired, etc.

I'm ready to live a 'normal' life, to get this weight off, and hopefully, one day get married. But I don't know what to do to overcome this food addiction for good. Any advice or encouragement is appreciated. Thanks so much!",1626903054.0

I want to get this under control for a variety of reasons.  I really did love food but its best if I get it under control and confront my addiction.  I am trying to step down in calories.  I food journaled without chaning a thing and I was at 3,000 calories.  But if I go way down to 2,000 calories I get way hungry and mad and it blows up in my face.  So I'm trying to step down and realize I can spare a month or 2 to step down to 2,000 and go to 2750 first then 2500 then 2250 then 2000.

Here are a few things I'm experimenting with right now

1.  Which foods fill me up and make me feel the best?
2. Which foods make me feel terrible and do not make me feel good at all?
3. When in the timing of the day it makes sense to best allocate my calories?  Maybe fill up at lunch a little more?
4. What are my trigger foods and make for days of cravings?

I recently discovered I‚Äôm a good addict I suppose - I was watching some content by Russell Brand and he mentioned food addiction, he defined an addiction as a behaviour with negatives effects that you can‚Äôt stop (paraphrasing) and I also watched a video of his where he mentioned that craving food and eating and feeling bad after (I do) is clearly not filling the want, because if it was you wouldn‚Äôt feel bad after.

Anyway, I‚Äôm circa 30 and I‚Äôve always been a gym goer, so I convinced myself I was ‚Äúbulking‚Äù throughout my twenties. I‚Äôd eat very large amounts of food but stayed in decent shape due to gym, I would consume so much. I‚Äôve also hidden eating, gone out to eat secretly and not told girlfriends before. Recently with lockdown and kids I‚Äôve gained circa 25kg. So I am trying to tackle that. It‚Äôs only been a few days but I‚Äôve had a revolution. I‚Äôve watched a bit of Russell‚Äôs content on addiction and ordered his book. Believe it‚Äôs a twelve step which originally I thought was just for religious folks, but doing more reading I understand the ‚Äúhigher power‚Äù doesn‚Äôt need to be The Lord.

A word of advice,39,oir4d3,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/oir4d3/a_word_of_advice/,7," I can give you a golden advice here, your enemy is **refined sugars**. The key to start to take control on your eating is to remove this addictive evil substance completely from your diet, that means that you are accountable for anything you eat, you even need to plan ahead and prepare all your meals for the day. Make no mistake, you might feel this is your fault, it's not, it's the food industry. Replace the carbs from pastas, breads, refined sugars with vegetables and certain fruits and once you are on a good stable spot, never ever give refined sugars a second chance, do not have cheat days or give yourself mini-rewards. Just like an alcoholic can't drink a drop of booze, if you have had sugar dependency you cannot allow yourself to re-active that brain path again.

I didn‚Äôt think eating for pleasure was a problem in the past, but looking back on the past four years I guess I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs progression to now. I will go out of my way to eat for pleasure or to fill the void, even if I don‚Äôt physically want to get up to make it happen, and I do this on a daily basis. I won‚Äôt want to cook, but will let the thought of my cravings or simply good tasting food make me get up to make something to eat, and then I will do it again, snack again, get coffee again. It‚Äôs like I constantly need to be consuming something tasty, if not I won‚Äôt be satisfied or feel content. I constantly seek the pleasure of enjoying the concept of eating. I ordered from the same fast food place 5 times this week.... My cravings are usually a specific foreign food, and especially meats. 

I want to stop this because the physical after effects feel horrible, and I hate the mental strain this has on me. I can‚Äôt keep replying food to fill my every void or bad emotion.... Today I ate so much that I actually felt nauseous after. Luckily I didn‚Äôt vomit, but I felt it coming. I‚Äôm tired of relying on food to make me happy.... It‚Äôs going to have serious mental effects on me if I don‚Äôt stop it soon, especially as I already deal with medically diagnosed depression. I hate that I feel like I need it to cope.

Found something that worked for me...,38,of330m,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/of330m/found_something_that_worked_for_me/,6,"After trying almost every diet in the world and being on a binge / starvation cycle for years I finally found a system that works for me.

The Plant Paradox by Dr Gundry is typically recommended for people who have autoimmune disorders. 

I found this eating program to be a game changer because it is designed to rebuild your biome and gut health. 

The logic is that you have good bacteria and bad bacteria in your gut. The bad bacteria is addicted to junk food so you have to starve them out and feed the good bacteria with nutritious things.

So you power through a three day cleanse of veggies and lean protein to reset your gut and then slowly start reincorporating foods from the 'approved' list over the course of three phases in six weeks.

You have to get serious about cooking at home and rebuilding your pantry, but I found that WAY easier than trying to count calories or stay in ketosis forever. 

The first 11-14 days can be a doozy, but after that I had no problem staying on this eating program and am enjoying the recipes.  

My mind is clearer than ever, my energy is up, and I've been losing about a pound a week without tracking or restricting calories.

Most of my cravings are gone and I haven't binged since I started almost 6 weeks ago.

In fact, I have suddenly fallen back in love with vegetables and have salad cravings of all things now. It's wild!

What didn't work for me: 
Intuitive eating was an absolute atrocious disaster. I gained 15 lbs in a month and destroyed my health as evidence of blood work I got after the experiment.

I really wish I could take that one back as I still haven't lost all the weight that was gained. 

Hope that helps someone out there who was struggling like me just six months ago.",1625602419.0

I have been careful not to gain weight and to always eat enough to maintain my current weight which is 82kg (I am 176cm tall, male, so I would say it's pretty average).

Besides the bloat, I am happy with how I look. However, recently, I have been trying to eliminate intoxicating things from my life, things that make me dependent and nonfunctional. I eliminated cigarettes and drinking coffee, in the past 3 months alone (I have been feeling much better), and just a couple of days ago, I stopped grabbing the said snacks and switched to eating keto.

I eat in a deficit of 500 kcal, and I drink vitamin C in the morning and multivitamins after the meal. I also do one meal a day.

I have done this before, and I know that I am fully capable of this. The switch usually takes 2-3 days, but I did not have this junk food addiction back then. I  remember it did not suck this much when I did it in the past. Back then, I used to always cook on my own very different stuff that range from pasta to some traditional stuff from my country. And then when I wanted to shed weight and took keto seriously, I started doing the above. It worked like a charm. I kind of slipped right in. Lost around 15kgs.

However, now, it feels almost impossible. I feel lethargic. I have headache, I feel tired, and overall in a very low mood. I started to think that I might be experiencing withdrawal symptoms of some kind that are junk food related, and I was wondering if it is a real thing and whether or not you have experienced such things.

Food is ruining my life, and still, I can't stop eating. My home situation is pretty abusive (I'm working on getting out) so pretty much my whole life I've had some sort of anxiety/compulsion/addiction.

Just forever chasing that moment of happiness I get seeing ""Your order has been placed."" 

I have no familial comfort or closeness, and have been pretty much raising myself since I was 9 or 10 years old. We always had food to eat, so it wasn't scarcity that drove me toward disordered eating. I've just always sought comfort in unhealthy ways, self-soothing with any and everything I could find.

Aside from diagnoses, I just have this overall cloud of depression and anger from feeling like I've lost control.

 There is no blood test to diagnose food addiction. As with other addictions, it‚Äôs based on behavioral symptoms.

**Here are** **8 common symptoms****:**

1. frequent cravings for certain foods, despite feeling full and having just finished a nutritious meal
2. starting to eat a craved food and often eating much more than intended
3. eating a craved food and sometimes eating to the point of feeling excessively stuffed
4. often feeling guilty after eating particular foods ‚Äî yet eating them again soon after
5. sometimes making excuses about why responding to a food craving is a good idea
6. repeatedly ‚Äî but unsuccessfully ‚Äî trying to quit eating certain foods, or setting rules for when eating them is allowed, such as at cheat meals or on certain days
7. often hiding the consumption of unhealthy foods from others
8. feeling unable to control the consumption of unhealthy foods ‚Äî despite knowing that they cause physical harm or weight gain

If more than four to five of the symptoms on this list apply, it could mean there‚Äôs a deeper issue. If six or more apply, then it‚Äôs likely a food addiction.",1624214281.0

Edit: thank you for all your replies. I've thought a lot about it, and my best approach is a multi pronged approach imo. I know the trigger is stress so I'm going to tackle both my resilience to stress but also reducing the stress in my life.

So that'll be like trying a few squats with a kettlebell or a 10 minute walk outside instead of grabbing for the nearest chocolate bar. Then after I can have a little chocolate but hopefully the adult me will feel more in control.

I tend to stop logging food when I get stressed, but not doing so can lead to shame and exacerbate the cycle. So logging no matter what, and allowing the negative feelings to be forefront end tackling them in the moment, then tackling the stress.

Finally, my job and career are stressful, it's time for: 1. An initial job change to something less intense; 2. A career change, even if it means less money.

Also I'm a passive and introvert person who tends to say yes. I should switch to saying ""Maybe"" so I can carve out more time for exercise and relaxation.",1624076433.0

Just my experience,19,o1twr4,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/o1twr4/just_my_experience/,4,"So theres a history of eating disorders in my family, my aunt was diagnosed with anorexia at 14, and although undiagnosed my mother also has a very tumultuous relationship with food. So as you can imagine I grew up with some extremely unhealthy views and attitudes towards food. It along with alcohol became my escape from the traumas I was experiencing throughout my childhood and teenage years. 

Between the ages of 13-22/23 my eating WAS an addiction no doubt and I'm still fighting each day, some days I lose, some days i win. Most days are very confusing because you cant cold Turkey on food. I'm also not diagnosed just to be clear. I literally stole money or found money on the floor to go buy food. I used to steal food from vending machines. In my country they used to give 6th form (16-18) students from poor backgrounds money each week to help pay for things like travelling to school and buying lunches. At my worst, I was skipping school just to eat with this money that i got. I also had other problems but this was a big one. Honestly looking back at it I see crack head behaviour. I mean that in no rude way, addiction is a demon, what I mean is that I see that my actions were those of an addict then and it's scary how ""ok"" I thought I was. 

I moved out around 22/23 and realised just how bad my eating was. Junk food 3x a day, endless snacks, just a huge constant binge, along with guilt, self hate, and so I'd go the other way for a while and ONLY eat this or NEVER eat that. I thought that I was helping to manage my problem. I did recognise it as a problem but unfortunately my attempts at helping were just restricting for the same reasons as I was binging. 

So a year or so ago I started eating intuitively. Interestingly, this is the time where I was living in a place that made me feel safe, where I could get to know myself and grow within the safety of a place that I had some control over. I took this time to experiment, lesrn what I like and see how it made me feel. So during this period i learned:



I am worth eating well for 




Eating healthily makes me feel great and gives me more energy than the see-food diet (what a surprise!!!). 



Smoothies are a good way to get lots of vitamins and other stuff into the body in a tasty package. 



Fish is a good alternative to meat if you don't want to be veggie or vegan. 



My body needs extra protein because I have ADD and have chosen to be unmedicated, ergo I need to give myself plenty of vitamins and protein in my diet.




Kale isn't that great 




Tofu isn't gross




Chinese (proper chinese food) is very healthy and chock full of vitamins and proteins. It's also easy to store, easy to cook. 12/10 recommend learning to make a really tasty noodle soup with lots of meat/fish and veg.




Sometimes, my hunger can be satisfied by doing something that satisfies my brain like reading, working, writing etc. Maybe its like my brain is bored and ""hungry"" for activity but I've trained it to full that space with eating? I dunno I'm no doctor. 




Falling off falling wagon is OK. I love you. Talk lovingly to yourself, replace sweets with fruit and dried fruit.




I still dont understand what a healthy relationship with food looks like, but I'm working on it. 




Something I'm still learning: if its healthy for your mental health, its HEALTHY. Balance is important. 



Habits are hard to break. 




I recently fell off the wagon several times (interestingly my home life was up in the air as well as my emotions at that point) but now I've settled down and now I'm starting to just let my body tell me what I want to eat. Still intuitive eating. I cant afford a therapist so I can only hope that this is a healthy way to go about eating.",1623925358.0

Please help me,4,nvrkgr,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/nvrkgr/please_help_me/,0,"  

Hello all, 

I would like to explain my struggles with weight loss and eating healthy. My upbringing did not focus on the importance of a healthy diet and regular exercise. I started recognizing a problem at age 13, school holidays consist of playing video games, eating almost a loaf of bread worth of sandwiches, easily a whole box of cereal, maybe a liter or two of soft drink then a large amount of fast food for dinner.

My weight quickly started to sky-rocket, and at age 14 I decided to jump on a scale. Weighing in at 139kgs with a BMI of 50, it is the heaviest that I have ever been. I did not like the feeling of it at all, I felt different from most kids my age, I struggled walking far, or upstairs, I felt uncomfortable in all sorts of clothes, and nearly everywhere I went, it was completely debilitating.

I started walking around the block every night (about 1km) as I was too embarrassed to do it in the day, I also succeeded in cutting down the amount I ate. At 16 I weighed in at 120kg with a BMI of around 40.

At 17, I started working at Dominos and signed up to Gym. My diet was still bad, sometimes I would have a gym session then go get a big mac or pizza, which kept my weight at 120kgs until I was around 19. At 19, I started eating less and less and introduced more exercise, I got to around 110kgs. At 19 I got into my first serious relationship, when the relationship ended (a year later) I was back at 125kgs. Having my heartbroken I was absolutely determined to get to my goal weight (under 100kgs).

I signed up for a personal trainer and started learning about good nutrition, I was extremely consistent in tracking my macros and became absolutely addicted to exercise. At the age of 21, I weighed in at 90 kgs, I felt very strong, had a decent knowledge in nutrition and exercise, completed a cert 2 in nutrition and cert 3 in fitness, and even started working at a Gym. Being 90kgs at 21 felt amazing, it was by far the best I have ever felt. I could easily run 5-10kms, had a flat belly, clothes from any store fit me, those who knew me at 14 would never recognize me. (21 my BMI was 29 with a high muscle mass).

At 21 I got into a two-year relationship, the first year I had put on 8 kgs then lost 6, I was still relatively active, exercising every day but was not eating as healthy, I would often binge eat with my ex-girlfriend. 

In March 2020, I lost my job at the GYM due to COVID. I started working at Dominos again while at Uni, due to COVID-19 the Gym and Jiu-Jitsu had closed, and I stopped my daily exercise. Once again, I had fallen into the trap of constantly eating pizza and fast food, my relationship was becoming toxic, and we ended it. This brings me to today, at the age of 23 back up to 120kgs, with a BMI around 38.

I certainly still feel strong and somewhat fit, a lot fitter than what I felt the last time I was 120kgs, but nothing like the fitness I felt at 90kgs. I can still cope with a lot of exercises and since COVID dying down I have returned to Jiu-Jitsu and regular exercise.  
 

I know consistency is key and the very simple scientific method of Calories in/Calories out works but I really struggle to control myself around bad foods.

My diet is very bad binge eat a lot and I feel like I am addicted to bad foods. Some nights I cannot help myself but go to 7/11 to get a donut‚Ä¶ then while I am out, I have some sudden compulsion to pick up 3 donuts, 2 brownies and why not stop at McDonald's on the way home and buy a cheeseburger or two, or three.  
 

Straight after the food I always instantly regret it and it almost sends me into a depressive state. This whole letter has been written over 3 depressive states. I am usually quite a resilient person, but I am starting to feel like this is gripping my life, almost like I am an ice addict looking for a fix. I am embarrassed about it, I often eat alone when, so I feel like no one judges me.  
 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is a psychological issue or something a dietitian should deal with, Any help would be greatly appreciated.",1623230682.0

Stages of Food Addiction,22,nrg61d,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/nrg61d/stages_of_food_addiction/,2,"**For those who already know they have a problem, and that problem is food addiction, an important question is: at what stage are they in the progression of the disease?** This makes a difference in terms of what they might have to do to recover.

 In the early stage, food addicts are often unaware that they have a problem; food often seems more like the solution than the problem. The main problem usually begins with a lack of good education about food addiction.

By the middle stage, food addicts have tried a number of diets or other more extreme strategies to control their eating; they are suffering negative consequences ‚Äì being overweight, depressed, leading a secret life, feeling guilt or shame about both ‚Äì but the consequences do not seem severe enough to justify giving up entirely the foods they like the most, much less asking for help to do this.

In late stage, food addicts know their problem is critical but they find their situation hopeless; they know that they are powerless to stop by themselves, but commercial weight loss, therapy on underlying issues, and sometimes even 12-Step programs alone are not sufficient to get them abstinent and in stable recovery. Most food addicts at this stage need professional treatment.

In final stage there are usually very serious medical complications. This could be morbid obesity, failing joints, advanced diabetes, progressive heart disease, and much more ‚Äì including a desire for death. Paradoxically, eating has often become the most important thing in their lives, and while it is causing an early and painful death, it can also be the only thing that they believe makes life worth living. Treatment at this stage must often be primary, follow the addiction model and be hospital-based. There currently are no such programs.

Tragically, knowing that food addiction is a serious, progressive disease is often insufficient to break food-addictive denial. The chart below visualizes the disease stage and the recommended action at each stage.

# 1.) PRE-DISEASE

No sign of abnormal eating or reactions to specific foods. If no dependency or pathology develops, this stage will continue through the person‚Äôs entire life.

  
**Prevention:**  
Education about food addiction. Ongoing checks for signs of chemical dependency. Moderation in eating, especially commonly addictive foods, e.g. sugar, caffeine, excess fat, alcohol, drugs. 

&#x200B;

# 2.) EARLY STAGE

Problems with weight management, cycles of weight gain followed by dieting, weight loss, and weight gain again. Occasionally binge eating on sugar, excess fat, or volume. Could be early-stage food addiction or a normal eater making unhealthy choices.

  
**Detox and Abstinence:**  
Identify addictive foods. Eliminate binge and trigger foods. Move though detoxication. This often seems extreme if negative consequences are not yet severe, the beginning of addictive denial.

&#x200B;

# 3.) MIDDLE STAGE

Frequent binge eating and grazing. Purging or severe reactions may begin. Rationalizing before eating, guilt afterward. Could be advancing food addiction or emotional problem eater with a psychologically based eating disorder.

  
**Twelve Step / Peer Support Group / Counselor:**  
Participation in a food-related Twelve Step program, e.g., Overeaters Anonymous, and/or work with a food addiction counselor. Assistance with addressing blocks to physical abstinence, especially denial. Develop feeling skills, resolve trauma.

&#x200B;

# 4.) LATE STAGE

Serious consequences from overeating ‚Äì morbid obesity. Type II diabetes, chronic depression and/or spiritual disillusionment, and eating anyway. Food no longer provides comfort, escape, oblivion, etc. Loss of control, increasing tolerance.

  
**More Structure and Support:**  
Participation in a highly structured Twelve Step program, e.g., Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous, Compulsive Eaters Anonymous ‚Äì HOW. Outpatient treatment and/or workshops such as those offered by ACORN. Abstinence as a spiritual path. 

&#x200B;

# 5.) FINAL STAGE

 Severe consequences ‚Äì hospitalization for heart attacks, suicide attempts, lost jobs or inability to work, ruined relationships, treatment and/or intestinal surgery followed by relapse, housebound or confined to nursing homes.

  
**Primary Inpatient or Residential Treatment:**  
Given the lack of any hospital-based inpatient treatment for food addiction, alternatives include Turning Point of Tampa, Milestones, Shades of Hope, ACORN‚Äôs year-long Living in Abstinence program. This is sometimes insufficient.

&#x200B;

# The last stage of food addiction is death.

The death rates for food addicts are probably similar to those for obesity: statistically, active food addicts can expect to die five to ten years before their healthier counterparts, and more importantly, the last stages of life for the active food addicts can be very painful physically, emotionally and spiritually.",1622734062.0
Emotional attachment to fast food only?,29,nqpiig,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/nqpiig/emotional_attachment_to_fast_food_only/,14,"So, I have been following my journey of trying to heal my relationship with food and hoping intuitive eating would help with this.

As someone with self-diagnosed food addiction, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't feel like the restriction of dieting was causing the issue. But it turned out, IE helped a LOT. 

I am now at the point where i have had ice cream in the freezer for almost a month, and rarely ever feel like eating it. I have had tons of sugary snacks in the cabinet and forget they're in there. I eat ""normal sized"" meals and snacks, and never eat past fullness anymore.

The ONE problem IE didn't help with at all was my addiction to fast food. Door Dash is ruining my life lol. It is expensive, and fast food is barely even real food. There is no nutritional value in most of it, it's just loaded up with fat and salt and sugar to make it more palatable. It makes me FEEL awful. 

But I am having a really hard time not getting it constantly. And none of the old tricks will work. Not carrying money with me, not driving past it, etc, because I order it from Door Dash most of the time.

I tried sticking to a budget where I could only spend a certain amount. That didn't work either. I just spend my savings on it. I spend bill money on it. 

I deleted the app from my phone, and just use it on the computer browser now. So, that didn't help either.

I tried making exceptions. So I wouldn't order Door Dash or uber Eats, but I would allow myself to get it if I was already out with friends or something. Nope. Didn't help.

I will say this: intuitive eating has helped move beyond craving it constantly, because I allowed myself to eat it with full permission for so long. BUT I STILL ORDER IT. It literally won't sound good, I can't afford it, and I know I won't be satisfied. But I still get it over and over again. It makes my physically ill, and I still get it.

At this point, I think it's just a complete emotional attachment to it. It's my only coping mechanism, the only thing that makes me feel better, the thing I can't seem to quit. It completely feels like a drug I can't quit more than a day or so. 

Sorry this was so long. I could go on and on about it. I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to this form of food addiction? And if anything has helped.",1622650527.0

In january, I actually managed to take it under control. However, in march, I met someone who LOVED to eat (idk if he was a food addict) and it just went downhill from here. I am always tired and I start to think that it may be because of how much I eat.

Happily I'm not obese but I know it's mainly because I live with my parents, so I have to eat in secret or go outside. However, when I will have my own house (in 1 year), I'm afraid that I will totally fall in my addiction and become totally obsessed with eating. I could even die.

So I am not sure if I have a food addiction but reading some posts makes me think yeah, I really do. When I thought of food addicts I thought they ate lots of cakes and cookies and donuts and pizzas and the like. I didn't think it could be broken up into several different categories.
So what brought me here is I was put on a medication for high cholesterol. And I am only 40 years old. My cholesterol was high. A year and a half ago it was just above high and I was told the generic just watch your diet and it will come down. I completely ignored that and continued to eat badly. But it is my dinners and snacks that get me. Steak with cheesy broccoli and a loaded baked potato was a frequency last summer and this past winter. Bacon wrapped chicken breasts stuffed with garlic cream cheese. Shredded cheese mixed into the garlic cream cheese as well as sprinkled on top. Snacks? Ham sandwich with two different types of sliced cheese with a side of potato chips. That is a full on meal but for me it was a snack.

I am responsible for feed me and my 3 children. I have to somehow get calories into my youngest and he is so picky. Cheesy broccoli and canned green beans are the only vegetables he will eat. As for proteins we have a lot of chicken nuggets, sometimes twice a week just so I know he is getting something. 

Every thing is a mess in my head. I have a few health issues that prevent me from doing any other exercise except walking and only short distances and McKenzie exercises for my back. Vacuuming my house can put me on the couch for the rest of the day sometimes.

I also have bipolar disorder. The crippling depression is bad enough but I am on a medication that is known for raising cholesterol and makes you crave all the carbs. All of them. I've been known to dip saltines in caramel sauce we had for ice cream sundaes because I needed a sweet carb and we were going grocery shopping the next day so we were out of all the cookies and such.

If you got this far thank you! 
So I guess I am asking where do I start? Any tips? Thank you all.",1621472492.0

I'm a mom to a toddler. I have a host of issues. A lot of anxiety/stress/angry issues and def depressed. I'm 5'3"" and about 210-215. My only coping mechanism I have ever had was eating sweets. Specifically ice cream but really anything will do. A little is never an option. It's always the whole pint. The whole box. The whole pack. My reward, my big serotonin release, seems to come from the act of completing the container. I always eat these things after my son goes down for his nap or to bed. Preferably when husband isn't home but sometimes when he is as well . There have been times I've hidden how much I eat from him in shame. Then I fall asleep in a nice sugar crash and I am happy. I have no outlets. No money to do nice things for myself. No family or friends to visit. I struggle with parenthood and the exhaustion both mental and physical that comes with my struggle with parenthood makes it much harder to say no to food. I've lost weight very successfully before. But I have no ability to lose weight, get on a healthy lifestyle, and then reintroduce the foods at smaller amounts like a normal person. As soon as I reintroduce small amounts of treats, then nothing is enough. 

Problem now though isn't just my weight. I fear my fatty liver is back. I have abdominal pain. I've had high cholesterol that have ignored for years  I have massive anxiety over going to the doctor. For the pats 5 years I keep saying, I'll lose weight and get healthier then I'll see the doc. But lately I've been feeling like trash. So fatigued. So tired. Barely able to get anything done. I am thinking it's part physical part depression. But I NEED to fix myself because I want to be here for my son. And I want to be a good influence. I feel like a failure in so many fronts and I need to fix this.

I'm 22F, 160cm and roughly 82kg (5'3"", \~183lbs), weight has always been a huge problem for me, even when I was 30kg (66lbs) lighter. I always had a bad relationship with food, it started when I was 11 or 12 and someone at school made fun of me for being fat, even though looking back I was average looking. Then at 13 I entered a toxic relationship and my boyfriend always told me to lose weight, so I starved myself. My father is an alcoholic, there always was tension in my home, my parents were always fighting and I was always stressed. I started to eat emotionally at around 12-13.

Where am I now? Living with my fiance, we have a dog and a good life together. I have a great job that I like, pays okay and it's not stressful. I've been working from home since November last year and I gained 10kg (22lbs) since then. I just eat and eat and eat and I can't stop... If I know there are some sweets in the house I just cannot not eat them.

I always knew I had problem with food but it just recently struck me that it's really an addiction. My fiance was supposed to make dinner for us (french fries with fish), but he needed to do some stuff before while I was working and for two hours I couldn't focus on my job, because I was thinking about the food. How delicious it's going to be, how I'm going to enjoy it, etc. Ten minutes after eating a big portion I went to get myself an apple, a banana and a cookie. Twenty minutes later I started to think what else I can eat, because I was hungry.

Sweets, snacks, fats trigger me. I can't think straight if I know they're in the house. My fiance also loves snacks and sweets (he doesn't have a problem like me), so I don't want to burden him with forbidding those from the house.

What do I do? I just have no idea, I can't afford any counseling or therapy sadly.",1620564284.0

Where to begin...,24,myzecz,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/myzecz/where_to_begin/,7,"Long story short...I don't know where to begin. I realize that I have a food addiction. I eat food when I'm happy, I eat when I'm sad, I eat when I'm bored, I eat when I'm already full, I eat until I am uncomfortable....all the things....but I have no idea where to even start to begin. I have limited resources. I currently do not have medical insurance (insurance will kick in after my probationary period at my new job) and I don't have a ton of extra money to spend on things at this time. I am so overwhelmingly unhappy, and it's so embarrassing that my response to that is to comfort myself with food...even though I literally hate myself afterwards. I was doing meal prepping earlier this year, and I seemed to be doing a lot better, but when I would ""treat"" myself, I would end up going overboard and once I'd gone overboard, well, might as well go all out.

Where do I start, y'all? How do I begin to break this incredibly unhealthy vicious cycle?",1619448626.0
Realization and Intro - hello!,23,myfyk9,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/myfyk9/realization_and_intro_hello/,6,"Hi all. For the first time in my life I‚Äôm coming to terms with my food addiction and facing it head on. I‚Äôm so happy and relieved to find the sub and am looking forward to contributing as well as receiving. 

I‚Äôm 29 yo female. 

Three weeks ago I started a medical weight loss program at a center in my town. I have eliminated 5 pounds of fat and 5 pounds of water weight. Yay. 

This past Friday, I went for my weigh in and left back for home, driving in the car I had a flashback of my first day going to the clinic and leaving to get myself a burrito and horchata as my last meal, wishing that I could do that again and experience the satisfaction and comfort it provides. 

Then it hit me like a 100 ton brick reality check..... oh my god - the only source of pleasure I seek in my life is for my pallet and the feeling of fullness in my belly. What am I denying myself by doing this?  Why is it that this is the only excitement that I crave in my life?  

It‚Äôs still so fresh and new to be coming to accept that I use food to satisfy so many wants and needs in my life, covering up for parts of my life I haven‚Äôt been ready to face. 

But damn it - it is time to face it!  And learn!  And find peace with myself!  

I hope sharing helps you in some way too. Maybe you have some advice for me if you are a little further along than me?

I feel lost. I‚Äôve wanted to lose weight. I‚Äôve tried keto, intermittent fasting, and things like HelloFresh that provide portion control, but also clean food. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

Struggling with fast food and overeating my whole life,30,mwuyex,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/mwuyex/struggling_with_fast_food_and_overeating_my_whole/,5,"Hey guys, I feel desperate to break a cycle. 
I am 30M and I find that no matter what I try, I always end up in a vicious cycle of unhealthy eating habits. 
Growing up, my whole family was obese and uneducated about their own health. We did not have an effective culture around good health. One of my distant cousins died in his 30s from being fat. 

I really want to break this cycle. I have had periods of my life where I can exercise and diet well for about 6 months, then I fall back into my old ways and gain back everything I lose. A classic yo yo effect. 

I live in a nice area where most people live a very healthy life,  and I feel insecure about my health compared to them. Its this feeling of immaturity like I haven't grown the fuck up about my health yet. 

Some nights during the week I find myself in fast food drive thrus ordering 3000 calories of future heart disease then eating in my car to hide it from people. Feeling ashamed of myself when throwing away the trash after, feeling like I even need to be sneaky about that. 

I know what I need to do to get good health. I am educated on how to exercise and eat right. I just don't do it. 

Part of it I think is my lack of social life. I eat emotionally. I work infront of the computer all day writing software. Then I get away from the computer while being pretty in my head after thinking about complex issues all day. Then I have nobody to really enjoy company with in a way that fills me up emotionally, and despite the millions of things I know I can do about the situation, rather than putting in the work, I eat. 

All of this makes me think my unhealthy eating is in part a combination of habit and also a symptom of deeper psychological problems. 

Maybe I need a good therapist, don't know where to find some good ones for this issue.

I have this bad habit (decades long bad habit) of eating about 1/3 to 1/2 of my daily calories right before bed. A couple of weeks ago I limited this to just eating one bag of microwave popcorn before bed instead of chips, sandwiches and other snacks. It reduced my daily caloric intake by a lot and I lost a small amount of weight in those two weeks alone. In addition I was eating fairly clean during the day. I know I'm turning to food for emotional soothing and simply the habit alone is a big contributor. My day doesn't feel complete unless I do that. I'm in pretty good shape, run 5k 2 to 3 times a week and weight lift 2 times a week. I'm 41. I want to look after my health better. I know in my mind that I'm not eating the way I want its just really hard to resist and I love the experience of eating. I'm not really looking for replies or a solution, I know what the solution is. Part of that is just sharing my experience I guess and getting these thoughts in writting. I need to get back to my committment of eating healthier meals, and less snacks.",1619016849.0

Okay, so I don't want to go into full detail as to why I have a food addiction, but I'll give some.  My dad, (who is a much better guy now and I love him) used to eat all the food mom made and when my sister and I were very young, mom used to put double the food on our plates just to make sure we had enough to eat after dad got through with the rest of it.  Well, he would get upset over this and would not let us leave the table until every last bit was gone.  So this would have us sitting at the table for hours, miserable, until we finished it all.  Years later (my sister and I have both gotten better for it, took me way longer than her) I still had a compulsion that I could not leave the table until all the food on my plate was gone.  Including restaurants and those huge portions.

I would eat myself sick most of the time because the food had to be gone from my plate.  A couple years ago, I finally started limiting myself and telling myself that it was okay to not eat everything on my plate.  So, I did stop eating myself sick....for the most part I still used to especially when it came to pasta.  So at this point in my life before I started to actively try to lose weight, I weighed a total of 294 lbs in my early twenties.  I got a job at wendy's, started keto because I could afford my own groceries (was still living with my parents at the time and we live in the middle of no where so there really weren't opportunities for me) and I lost 45 lbs.  Wendy's became a terrible place to work however and I eventually wound up quitting, thus having to stop keto and I gained all that weight plus more to a total of 336 lbs to date.  

**I am now 27, living with my boyfriend and we are both overweight.  We are doing Keto together now and we have both made some nice progress in a couple of weeks.  I am down to 329 lbs....even though all of it was muscle mass I lost (smart scale) and he's lost some too and it was actual fat.  Well, long story short, we got some whey protein powder in today that's supposed to be a meal replacement and a good source of protein that I need (trying to build my muscle mass).  We had had a healthy breakfast earlier and I didn't think I was going to be able to drink the whole thing in one setting because it was making me full so I slowed down on it.  I'm finally done drinking it but....I can't tell if what I feel is hunger or fullness.  I should be full so it's taking everything in me to not reach for a snack, but I have this problem a lot and it still causes me to overeat.**

My story,58,mrdbw3,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/mrdbw3/my_story/,13," I'm Luke Dentler and I have struggled with my weight for most of my life. I was pretty small up until about sixth grade, I wasn't fat then but I was bigger than most of my friends. I have always loved to eat. I remember sneaking the jar of peanut butter up to my room as a young kid, or emptying all the snack cake boxes into the drawer in hopes my mom wouldn't realize how many were missing. Fast forward to my high school years I was well above 250 pounds and embrace my weight, I used humor so I wouldn't show that the jokes and nicknames didn't hurt me. I was the guy who was always eating candy, I could chug sodas, and I even won a pizza eating contest eating a large pizza in 2 minutes and 56 seconds. I graduated around 270 pounds and my weight gain never slowed down, I also alway cared what others thought of me I was worried people would talk bad about me. I never ate home cooked meals in my early twenties it was always fast food and energy drinks. In 2013 I tried to lose weight for the first time I severely restricted my calories and became a gym addict spending up to four hours a day in the gym aswell as exercising at home and even at work. I lost over 100 pounds in 6 months and was buff I was happy with the way I looked but then I stopped, I started eating out one night a week and it turned to two then four and I ended up gaining all my weight back and even more then I lost. I dealt with it for a while and tried again, this time without the gym just eating too little, of course that worked I lost another hundred plus but again I went back to my old eating habits and quickly put the weight back on. Since 2013 I have lost over 400 pounds by restricting my calories but would always gain the weight back and go back to my old eating habits. In September of 2020 I was my biggest at 422 pounds. I was a lazy husband and a ""couch dad"" I was content with being unhappy, I went to the doctor and she recommended binge eating groups on Facebook I eventually checked them out and found a twelve step program for food addiction, I fell in love with it I then decided to make a change. I started attending meetings and working the 12 step program and I learned so much about myself, I was a liar, manipulator, I hated myself, I was more concerned about what people thought of me then my loved ones around me. I have made a decision to try to lose the weight again, I am working on being the father and husband I want to be, I just want to be a good person, I want to do better tomorrow then I did today.

From first post here. I wanted to share my story and where I am in my recovery from food addiction. I've beat alcohol and cannabis addiction (3 years free of booze and almost a year cannabis). Next up is my relationship with food. 

I've been trying to improve my health over the last 3 years and have gotten the major deamons out of the way. My main foods that give me trouble are fast food such as macdonalds and potato chips, especially potato chips. For the last 10+ years I would generally eat at least 1 large (200+ grams) bag each and every day. 

I'm slightly overweight and despite that in generally pretty good shape - I can jog a 5k which I do a couple times a week. I want to lose my extra weight and I know the only way I can do it is with healthier eating. Vegetables make me gag so I'm working on that and leaning more towards the carnivore side of things. 

Last week was my first week tracking my calories and eating relatively healthy, until last night when I ate 1400 calories of junk that included a whole lot of bits and bites. Working on my pysche to not let that slip influence my commitment to eating better.",1618233275.0

I‚Äôm male, so that would be the average weight for someone my age assuming my height was average. I‚Äôm 5 foot one, however, and I haven‚Äôt started puberty. My eating habits are very bad, mainly because I‚Äôm just now getting a decent protein source. I started drinking the isagenix shakes, the chocolate mint one is my favorite. I have one to two two scoops a day, it fills me up a little, not enough. I also tried collagen supplements; I‚Äôm fine with them, I need to keep up with them. Besides that, most everything else in my diet is negative. For example, today I had one half a cookie, one and a half donuts, one of the two scoop isagenix shakes, (without the milk, which has protein on its own, it also contains 24 grams of protein with 24 grams of carbs; much better than my other foods) went to finish my cookie from earlier, then my mom surprised me with a Coca Cola icee, smallest size but still not something I needed. It‚Äôs late in the day but when my mom wakes up I‚Äôm probably gonna have some of her bugles. First off, my mom knows about half of what I eat. Definitely not all of it, but she knows enough to be concerned. Second of all, I don‚Äôt eat any other protein because of a processing disorder I was born with. 

My goals: I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point because my weight gain is out of control. Last June I was at 132 pounds (two inches shorter, if anyone is wondering), in the overweight category but on the BMI scale not obese. Now I am at 148, considered obese (I put 145 in the title because that has been my approximate average over to week, ranging from 144 on a day I starved myself to today, 148) or at least so I think, I haven‚Äôt weighed all day because I don‚Äôt want my mom to see my weight. At this point I really need to lose 14 pounds before the end of May, and I know I can do it because I‚Äôve done it before in that timespan, but I need help. My long-term goal is to be at a normal, healthy weight according to BMI by the time I‚Äôm eighteen. Any tips are helpful, and please remember that certain tips don‚Äôt work because of my processing disorder. Thank you, I hope I can get to my goal, as I need to because that is when my yearly check-up is. 

Side note: My very sugary diet is terrible, but today was a good day. Yesterday and Friday I had double that and maybe a little more protein, but definitely not enough to balance it out.",1618177138.0

The problem is, obviously I can‚Äôt go cold turkey on all food.

I have a therapist, but she doesn‚Äôt specialise in disordered eating and I‚Äôm doing such good work in other areas of my life, I don‚Äôt want to leave her for someone else (I can‚Äôt afford two therapists). I am a member of slimming world which is a paid for eating plan in the UK. The lady I work with is great - she‚Äôs lost 9 st and counting and really gets emotional eating. She‚Äôs also very understanding if I want to pick and chose which parts of the plan work for me. The plan also makes it very clear that it is a plan for life, not a crash diet and members at their target weight get free membership. It‚Äôs not designed for food addicts though, it‚Äôs designed for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people who want to lose weight.

The plan categorises food into three categories:

1) ‚Äúfree‚Äù food, which you can eat as much as you like as long as you are hungry (not bored, emotional, habitual, etc). These are high-volume, low calorie food designed to fill you up like fruit and vegetables, lean meat, eggs, pasta, rice, etc. All of your main meals should be mostly free food and a third of your plate should be veggies.

2) ‚Äúhealthy extras‚Äù these are slightly higher calorie foods, but they give you nutrients you need, like calcium and fibre, so you are encouraged to eat a limited amount of these (30g cheese and a bowl of cereal or two slices of wholemeal bread for example).

3) ‚Äúsynned‚Äù food (short for synergy) these are high calorie foods that are designed to help you stay on the plan long term without you feeling deprived of your favourite foods and giving up. You can have 300 calories or whatever you want a day, so you can choose to have a glass of wine or a couple of cookies or whatever.

My main (only?) trigger foods are chocolate and cake. I‚Äôm pretty good at eating sensibly if I can exclude those things (and when I say chocolate, I mean anything containing chocolate like cookies, or chocolate flavoured whatever).

I have three year old and I work part time. Monday and Friday it‚Äôs just the two of us hanging out. I don‚Äôt want her to see me eating unhealthy snacks and I don‚Äôt want to share so if I eat trigger foods, I go to the kitchen and try to sneak something I can eat quickly before she notices I‚Äôm gone. If I don‚Äôt have any trigger foods in the house and I can stop myself from going to the store, these days are miserable, but 9 times out of ten I don‚Äôt eat any trigger foods.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday she goes to daycare and I work from 3pm-8pm. This messes up my evening meal and also means I‚Äôm alone in the house from 10-3pm just trying to avoid finding an excuse to run to the store. Plus on Tuesdays I have therapy at 10am so I‚Äôm really vulnerable right after and super tempted to ‚Äúself soothe‚Äù with food.

Evenings are ok. My husband is really supportive but not controlling. But sometimes that drives me to eat secretly in the day because I don‚Äôt want to do it in the evening and disappoint him.

My diet plan works on weighing every week, but the consultant is happy for me to not do that if weighing is triggering.

I‚Äôm at a complete loss. Every time I try and cut out trigger foods, I convince myself that a tiny bit is ok and a week later I‚Äôm eating as much as I want.

What do I do? Can you help me set my limits so that I stick to them? Where should the line be?",1616363648.0

I am not an emotional eater, more like an opportunist eater. I have this irrational fear that I am going to miss out on the opportunity to eat. For example, If there is cake in the break room. My brain thinks ""Eat the cake, there will never be cake at work again"". If I get invited out to eat. My brain thinks ""Go eat, there will never be a chance to eat with your friends again"". I can be stuffed, and just finished a meal, but I ALWAYS say yes to more food because I am afraid I will miss out on that opportunity to eat. Even when I cook for myself, I am afraid the food will spoil or lose flavor... so I eat all of it. 

I know it is irrational. But I can't stop myself from eating. I also experience extreme excitement at the idea of eating, even meals I won't have for months (Like Christmas dinner). Can anyone relate? Any tips?",1616079418.0

RANT: Struggling to qualify for Weight Loss Surgery,13,m6cplc,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/m6cplc/rant_struggling_to_qualify_for_weight_loss_surgery/,8,"I have so many thoughts on FA. First off, I completely understand I am the one in control of what goes in my mouth. However, I have this voice in my head that demands so much of my attention. When I try to work through that voice, it just becomes louder and louder, and it steals so much of my energy. I know I'm nourished. I know I don't need the sweet snack or the Chinese food in my refrigerator that somehow made it to the next day to ""have it for lunch,"" which we all know rarely happens.   


The reality is, I know what it takes to lose weight, but my brain doesn't want to do the work because it's hard or it's emotionally hard, and my body just wants to do nothing and enjoy this lack of movement. It's like your body doesn't want you to get better, and your brain doesn't want you to get better. I finally started naming my addiction voice. His name is Jed, and I know when Jed is around. Jed loves attention, and he just doesn't shut up until he gets satisfied.   


The reality is that we live in a world where for those of us with Food Addiction, America has basically legalized Food Addiction drug dealers. When I look at fast food, all I see is a drug dealer with a drive-through window. They are literally killing us. It's not JUST them but these stimuli, but they play a HUGE role in addiction, not just for me but for many. It's the same thing when you go to the grocery store, and you see the chips and processed food isles. You know these are horrible for you, and yet we get them anyways. They are brightly colored, they are readily available and easy to consume, and they are by far the cheapest items in the grocery store.  


I just had a friend who just got weight loss surgery, and he is dropping pounds like no other! That will slow down, but it's a powerful tool to help him get his life back. The majority of people I know have gotten the surgery and have been able to keep it off. I want the surgery SOOOOOO badly.  


I want to feel good again. I am on Phentermine right now, and it does help, but that voice is still there, and it wants sugar more than anything else in the world. While I can more easily defeat that voice, it's still difficult to work through. I know what it's like not to have to care about my food addiction all the time. I know it's there, but it won't control my mind at every waking moment with its one-track mind.   


With the surgery, I know it is a point of no return (for me, it will be). I weighed in at the doctor's office at 485. I'm down to 476 as of this morning. I know though I'll be able to travel, keep up with life, move more, explore more areas of the world, get off my CPAP, backpack in the woods, hike, eat delicious foods that actually have nourishment to me and truly will make my years on this world, worth-while.  I know there is a lot here, but this has truly helped me get so much out. I know this group gets it. I can't share this with many people because this addiction is the hardest addiction in the world. But I know that together we can make a difference.",1615911371.0

Last year I had enough and started dieting (restrictive phase...) and lost 50 lbs in 4 months. I was eating below 1000 calories a day (around 8-700 on average) and walked 4-5 miles at least 3 times a week. I was so proud of myself and felt pretty euphoric, I thought this time I've finally beaten my binge eating problems and food addiction, and I felt amazing, energized, and rejuvenated (while everyone else was kind of worried about me because for an outside viewer I seemed like I was about to wither away, or as though I had some kind of terminal illness). I loved it and could never even imagine ever giving it up... Until Christmas came by and I lost all my control and binged for 5 days straight on whatever I could get my hands on. I felt horrible, disgusted, and completely out of control. As the holidays were over I vowed that I'd never binge again, and I was determined to ""get back on track"", I didn't really gain that much weight after all save for some insignificant pounds that someone would not even be able to notice on me, so the damage was not irreversible. I went back to my old schedule and everything seemed to go just fine for like 2 weeks until I just couldn't resist and binged on all the treats and cookies that I and my colleagues got from the residents as a present for Christmas (I work as a receptionist/concierge at a condominium) then ordered some Mcdonalds as well... I was devastated, I felt like I will never be able to get back on my diet and will gain all the weight back and all those months of hard work will be for nothing, and even worse, I'll be subjected to all the smug remarks of my colleagues, the residents and my family members about how I just couldn't keep the weight off, and how weak, lazy and worthless I am with zero self-control... I was alternating between restrictive and binging episodes throughout most of January and February, but I feel like binging is about to win finally, and I'm so terrified... I'm just so done with this, I don't want to live my life as a disgusting fucking greedy pig who can't do anything but eating himself into obesity and waste a lot of money on completely useless garbage...

It was a normal portion (at least I think so) and not even an hour later, my stomach is growling. I've read that when you go from eating a lot of food, all the time, to controlling your portions, it can take a bit for your body to adjust to less food; however, I've been eating less and healthier for months now, and I am consistently hungry after meals. I tried to track if it had to do with my menstrual cycle/hormones (I have an IUD and don't get my period, so it's hard to tell where I'm at in my cycle) but it didn't seem to line up with anything. I've been good about not eating anything between meals, to see if my body will adjust to the amount of food I'm giving it, but I see people talking about their ""hunger cues"" and I wonder how much I would truly eat if I ate every time I was hungry (the answer is way too much). I have considered eating 4 small meals a day to stop the intense hunger between meals, but I worry if I allow myself to eat throughout most of the day, I'll eat way more calories than I need, and all of this will be for nothing.

This isn't really a discussion question or anything. I just wanted to share my breakfast and my experience from yesterday. Hopefully, this will help me stay accountable for myself for the rest of the day. Lol

This morning I drank a homemade green smoothie. I made sure to add in more veggies rather than fruit. But to add just a hint of sweetness, I added a little squirt of honey. This green smoothie has been helping me not drive all the way to Chic-Fil-La every morning to get their chicken breakfast sandwich like I *really* want! And instead of spending $5 every morning on Starbucks coffees and fraps, I just bought instant coffee with a little sweet creamer. 

For lunch, I'll have some seasoned steamed veggies and baked chicken breast leftovers that I made yesterday. I'll eat that before I leave the house to run errands, so I won't be tempted to go to Wendy's. I've REALLY wanted a cheeseburger and some fries from Wendy's for the past three days, my mouth was literally watering from the thought of getting it, but I'm persevering! I understand it is just a craving and I'm not really hungry for it.

For dinner tonight, I'm making a meatless dish of spaghetti squash and sauteed portabella mushrooms. I have really bad sweet cravings in the evening time before bed, so I'll drink some tea and eat a Honeycrisp apple I'll munch on while playing video games. Lol

My goal for today is to try and NOT snack around so much. 

Yesterday, I was having a good day until my family came home with Chinese food, and the intense thought of hopping in my car and driving all the way downtown to get some actually forced me to put some clothes on and reach for the door. But before I touched my front door handle, I pulled myself back and said NO. I WAS LITERALLY FIGHTING MYSELF IN MY HALLWAY IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF NOT LEAVE MY HOME TO GO GET CHINESE TAKEOUT. I was grabbing my hand away from the doorknob and thought I was going to cry if I didn't have it! This addiction thing is no joke....

But I turned myself back around, went to my kitchen then cooked some chicken breast and some seasoned steamed veggies. It was good. I'm proud I didn't go get the Chinese food! And I'm extra proud of myself for going to the gym last night! Go me! Lol

So this is my blurb about my day. For the last three days, I've been doing good. I just started tracking my calories on that MyFitness-pal app. It is actually really helpful! It makes me visually see how much food and calories I am shoveling into my mouth. I recommend it if you're struggling like I am!

So I've been dieting very strictly since the beginning of the year. I've lost loads of weight, doing loads of exercise, I'm really happy and feel really great... but my plan was to do this diet for 12 weeks, and then a less drastic diet for 12 weeks, and then figure out maintenance. So to celebrate being halfway through... I thought I'd practice eating healthily but not as strictly for one weekend. My plan was to still be in a calories deficit, still eat healthily foods, but allow myself different foods and more calories. I planned what I wanted to eat very carefully so I was prepared.... and I've been binge eating like mad since last night, the plan was 2 crumpets with reasonable amounts of butter, I ate 5 crumpets and basically an entire stick of butter. Had beans on toast with cheese for breakfast, as planned, but an extra slice and extra cheese, followed by cake... You get the idea. It's been a nightmare, and I'm supposed to be doing my first 25 minute run with couch to 5k tomorrow morning, but now I just feel too fat and full and gross and like a failure and I never want to leave bed again and just eat endless chocolate bars to drown my sorrow.

I wasnt supposed to partake in any physical activity for those 3 months and instead started to really really enjoy eating. I ate every feeling I had, which made me feel shitty about myself, which made me want to eat more.

I gained 30 pounds over those 3 months, technically making me obese. (BMI measurements are stupid and not always accurate) This was mostly due to my new eating habits. I've gone on diets, did WW for a while, it worked at first but was A LOT of work to keep up with. I did ADF for a while but opted to stop that when I started school last month. I've lost about 20 pounds of that 30 but have fallen back into my old habits.

I binge eat if I restrict my window. I sneak food if I dont. I tried writing down what I eat and that seemed to help at first but then I started lying to myself... or forgetting what I ate because it wasnt part of my plan.

I want to get better but I dont know how. I need help... possibly even therapy. But I cant afford it. I have medical bills up the hooha and school to pay for too. 

I cant bring myself to admit it to my fiance because... well... I've been lying to him. I feel terrible.

They can ask their bank to not allow transactions for known gambling companies. These people are allowed to restrict themselves from their addiction. They are given the control to get better.

When I google about something similar for those addicted to things like Just Eat, Uber Eats etc, whilst there are a lot of people asking if it's possible to block themselves from using these services, there is also a ton of push back about it. ""People will just use cash"" ""who gets to decide what is healthy food"" ""just don't order it"" etc. It seems to weirdly irritate people that others might need a little assistance to overcome this problem. But then I suppose that's not surprising. I don't think people recognise food addiction the way they do gambling addiction or other such issues.

Addiction is addiction and I just feel like I KNOW my biggest problem. It's the convenience and instant gratification of takeaway. I can be strong all day but the minute my will weakens, I can have a pizza on it's way to me with like 6 clicks. It's laziness and addiction to junk. Why can I not make a decision as an adult to limit myself as I know my willpower is weak? The option to restrict MYSELF should be available to me. It's not a perfect solution. Much like with gamblers, there are definitely ways around it. But it's a start.

I wish I could just log on to Just Eat and ban myself. With obesity an epidemic, it's mad to me that this isn't an option.

Little backstory: 

  My father is 45 years old, 6‚Äô2, 342lbs and pretty much the rock of our family.. literally. In 2019 there was a scare as he had gone to the hospital for his chest being in pain. Doctors said it wasn‚Äôt necessarily a heart attack but if left to progress then maybe it would‚Äôve gotten really bad. He is supposed to take medication for it but I‚Äôm not even sure if he takes it anymore. 

The latest problem he faces is having a hernia and his legs tend to swell. He‚Äôs on his feet long hours for the job he does and can sometimes be in stressful situations as he is a loss prevention supervisor and used to be put under circumstances where he had to run to or wrestle someone stealing from the store he worked for. 

He used to go to the gym all the time and had a pretty straight routine, ate 6 small meals a day, workout sessions almost 4-5 days a week which consisted of lifting, never really a cardio guy, but was pretty solid and strong. 

He has myself and my sister who live on our own and a couple years ago at 42 he had another babygirl with his fianc√©. She‚Äôs now 3. This is around the time he started slipping with his diet. 

The soda he stopped drinking is a part of his daily routine now, he snacks all day long on the treats and sweets they buy for the little one, he drinks like a shit ton of beer, he stays up long hours of the night and barely gets any rest sometimes. If my baby sister doesn‚Äôt finish her food he eats it because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt waste food‚Äù my family on his side enables it with all the food they bring to him at work or make for him as well. 

Food has always been an issue with our family. My sister and I have been taking steps to lose weight and have been pretty successful. Both losing a combine weight of like 70lbs. Yet he can‚Äôt seem to do the same. I know that a little one can complicate things and he‚Äôs more tired than usual dealing with her but what do I do or say to him? His fianc√© came to my sister and I for help because she doesn‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôll laugh it off or say yeah I know but doesn‚Äôt do anything to change it. 

I get really emotional at the prospect of this only because I have friends who have lost parents due to overindulgence of food and alcohol. 

So I‚Äôm literally begging you guys to please give me some input as to what I can do or say to him. A plan he can use or just some kind of outline. Anything will be well appreciated. I know people say if your kids can‚Äôt make you change then you never will but I also know that food addiction is real and that it difficult for some people.",1611881241.0

I Made It A Week Into A Relentless Craving,24,l583kd,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/l583kd/i_made_it_a_week_into_a_relentless_craving/,9,"I have been battling Mcdonald's cravings for a week. 

I couldn't take it anymore, so I caved and went tonight. I tried making my own burgers/fries at home earlier this week (which was very yummy mind you), but to no avail. 

Does this happen to any of you? When I decide to go get fast food it feels like my mind kind of shuts down and my voice of reason becomes quiet (it's almost like I can't/don't want to think at all, I just act) and my body goes on autopilot until I'm about halfway through my meal. Then I start to realize what I'm doing and I may be able to throw the rest away (sometimes I complete the meal anyway despite pleading with myself in my head). Today I am proud of myself for not finishing everything, but I am of course still disappointed that I went at all. 

I hate this so much. I am shocked I even made it a week. Usually I cave within the hour once the cravings start. I'm scared this will set off a trigger, where I eat out every day for like three weeks before I can control myself again. I was hoping that if I waited long enough the cravings would disappear, but they just got worse and worse every day. 

Again, I am proud of myself for making it this far into a craving, and I'm trying to focus on that. But damn is it hard. I have a plan to whoop up some rice, veggies and mackerel tomorrow before 12pm to try and make sure I never feel hungry like I did today. I find that if I let myself feel hungry at all then the cravings come in hot. Here is hoping that doesn't happen.

Thank you for listening to my ramblings lol",1611642671.0

"I've been Sugar-Free for a year! (+Dopamine, Trauma, and Boredom)",56,l3hdzc,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/l3hdzc/ive_been_sugarfree_for_a_year_dopamine_trauma_and/,23,"I thought I'd share my story here about sugar, how it effected my dopamine and how food has been my means for filling the void of trauma I didn't know I had. Also how I am still struggling with food but slowly getting better, what I've learned, what I've applied, and how well it is working.

Starting Jan 2020 I decided I would give up sugar. I did it by going completely cold turkey. The first month was tough, I just ate a lot of sugar-free candy and if I had to cave with a sweetener I would use some honey. Now, it doesn't even enter my mind, I don't crave sweets, I very very rarely want cake, cookies, candy, etc. On the rare times I do want something very very badly, I just buy a diet Coke or some sugar-free candy, I eat a small serving and throw the rest away.

I am trying to lose weight and conquer my emotional eating. I would say I don't have a strong food addiction, I don't binge or purge, but I always fail with my weight loss because when I get emotionally stressed out from my hunger from dieting, I cave in and eat a whole bag of chips, then because I ate junk food, I get my dopamine fix and go off to do it the next day and two weeks in go, ""holy crap, we gotta start over again"" The reason I believe I have a food addiction is because I constantly think about eating and when I do cave, it's a lot of junk food (but I wouldn't say it goes as far as a ""binge"" per say)

I have been learning a lot about dopamine and how sugar, salt, and fat release dopamine in the brain and dopamine tells your brain to repeat the same thing again (originally for survival) I've learned that when you get too much dopamine from whatever source (including junk food) your dopamine receptors get damaged and die off so you have to increase how much dopamine you get to feel happy to feed less dopamine receptors. In order to heal your dopamine receptors you have to regulate your dopamine intake. When it comes to dopamine damage in drug addicts your dopamine receptors start to heal after a month and about a year later the dopamine receptors regrow and return back to normal.

This has concluded in my mind that most of us with food addictions are just like drug addicts and the key to our success is healing our minds. You can get dopamine from many sources other than food. But simply replacing dopamine from food with dopamine from other places isn't the solution either because then you can become an addict of other things that can be damaging to your life as well. Easy dopamine kicks also come in the form of video games, social media, TV, alcohol, drugs, porn, and more. You can easily go from a food addiction to a video game addiction. So the key is a dopamine detox, this is a controversial subject, but for me, it has worked!  


I have kicked sugar, but I can still easily get very angry, stressed, and even shaky by the time I hit the two week mark with my dieting, I cave, eat a whole bag of chips, and do that nearly daily until I realize what I've done and start over again. I have finally stopped this for two months straight and what I learned was far deeper than trigger foods and eating problems.

When I learned about a dopamine detox I went a whole day without TV, social media, music, books, caffeine, video games, junk food, any sexual activity, and more. I basically thought, walked, wrote down my thoughts, took naps, and ate healthy. I learned that my childhood of emotional neglect went further than I realized and that food was my means of filling a void I didn't even realize I had because I had suppressed it without knowing it. This made me realize that I think a lot of us have wounds we might not know about because we don't settle down to think, realize, and fix them, the food is just the band-aid of something even deeper, you need to find it, and fix that first before you can fix your issues with food.

Now every Friday I do a 12 hour dopamine detox to check in on myself and give myself a boost of time to heal my dopamine receptors by not feeding myself massive amounts of dopamine. You're going to hurt a lot, there will be a lot of tears, let your thoughts flow, feel them all, and let them lead you to healing, you have to face your pain and your demons to truly heal or you'll be stuck in the endless cycle of food dominating your mind through dopamine. You want to get bored, you want to have to be inside your mind. I knew for sure that my food addiction was connected to dopamine highs because once I got past the two week mark and really got into the deep of detoxing from both junk food and dopamine in general my mind and body started to crave dopamine in other ways. My libido has been horrible for 5 years and suddenly it came springing back like I was 18 again (I'll leave it at that). This meant that my body / mind knew I wasn't getting dopamine from food so it sought it out through other means. I had been killing my libido through getting almost all of my dopamine from food, so my mind / body never craved to get dopamine through sexual activity.  I started listening to music from my teenage years, it made me very happy and it lowered my appetite.  


I know you guys can do the same if you want to try what I have tried, it is hard, but it is so rewarding and it is hardest at the beginning. You can live a life beyond thinking about food all the time or emotional eating.  


Some tips, tricks, and what I continue to do

* Keep your dopamine kicks in check, 7 days a week make sure you aren't doing too much of anything that drives your dopamine high. If you like video games, play for an hour, set a timer, then do something boring like taking a 30 min walk with no music. 
* Learn to like getting bored, a healthy level of boredom on the daily keeps addictive behavior at bay
* If cravings hit you hard, watch a mukbang (this helps me, but it might be triggering for others so only try this if you think you are mentally prepared for it not working and making things worse)
* Keep junk food as far away from you, don't even bring it in the house and keep ready to eat things available. Kick the junk food first, then focus on how much you are eating. Binging is bad no matter what foods, but it's even worse when it's junk food, so if you can't help yourself and end up binging, at least it'll be with a salad and grilled chicken
* Go cold turkey, but with one thing at a time. For me, in order to get this under control, I think I have to be one of those people who never has it again. Junk food is a drug for me, and even if I have a little, the dopamine kicks in to tell me to do it again and that dopamine kick is insanely strong.
* Do regular dopamine detoxes'
* Remember that eating is one way to find joy in life and that there are literally thousands upon thousands of other things to do in life that can fulfill you, find them
* Still eat foods that are going to increase your dopamine, but in a healthy dose, not a rush. Stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy / fatty / saturated fat foods. I know everyone has foods they love that are healthy, eat more of those so you can still enjoy food. I love grilled tofu with steamed spinach and broccoli with a little bit of hoisin for some flavor. Raspberries are a delicious healthy snack, and are delicious frozen too
* Don't cave, I fully believe that if you're like me and food is an actual addiction, you have to give up junk food completely. Drug addicts don't recover by having some drugs sometimes. Junk food is our drug.

Food addict because of childhood,1,l3u82q,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/l3u82q/food_addict_because_of_childhood/,2,"Hi I would like some feed back from you guys. Growing up my parents only feed me boring food, such as rice etc... they barely bought anything new (healthy snacks or junk food) so I was stuck eating like 10 options growing which I didnt like very much, probably cause that's all my mom knew how to cook. When ever she whent to the store all she bought was rice, meat and vegetables to make food. The fridge would nearly be empty after making the food that would last the whole week. So I would basically be eating leftovers for a week. Because she buys things to make food that would last a whole week we didnt really have many other things in the fridge. So if I didnt like the food she makes that's what i would have eat, and i would always crave food because of this. Because of this i would find myself hyper obsessive with any food that wasnt my moms 10 basic options. I would always go to social events that I knew there was gonna food around just so i can eat them because i lacked different foods in my life. I would always find myself going ""hungry""/craving at home because I simply dont like the food even though we technically have food at home.

1/16/2020

I had a really bad binge last night. 

This morning: I feel a literal lump in my stomach. So uncomfortable. So full.

I felt it coming all week. My mindless, binging behaviors have totally ramped up. I had a little bit of whiskey two nights this week. I stopped at the weed shop for a joint. Met my friend for beers (I‚Äôve been basically sober since December 27). Another friend was there, suffering through a terrible breakup. They seemed to be painfully stumbling through it. I felt bad for them, and seeing their response to this break up was a big trigger for me (that is not what triggered my binge, but just reflecting on how anxiety-inducing that whole situation was). I just wanted to shake them and say *you don‚Äôt have to feel this way.* 

I came home and made a nice dinner- chicken. The three beers and joints would have been enough. I ate my dinner-all of it. Clean plate club, just like you trained me. Craving protein? Maybe, but I also just couldn‚Äôt stop. Made popcorn. Ate the whole bowl. Made another bowl. Ate the ice cream from the fridge. Filled the gaps with raisins.

I am full of shame about it. And it just keeps me in this cycle of self-disgust. And now I literally *feel* disgusting. I am bloated from the binge, I am bloated from the menstrual cramps. *Disgusting creature.* It is almost like a way to prove to myself, *see I TOLD YOU, you are gross.*

Love, you don‚Äôt need to feel this way.

I could feel it ramping up. The overwhelm. The stress. Food has become a way that I try to complete my stress cycle. The chomping of my jaw. The constant movement. If you are busy eating then you are busy and you don‚Äôt have time to confront the things you are trying to avoid. I keep the chemicals hitting my brain, that little hit to the reward/pleasure center. But my brain is confused. These are not rewards. This is not pleasure. *This* is definitely not what pleasure feels like. 

Writing, getting it out, that is pleasure.

*Actually* completing my stress cycle in the form of a run, washing my face/body, showering, relaxing into the couch, connecting physically with my lover. That is pleasure. I need my brain to understand that the binge behaviors are not pleasurable. Remember this feeling. When you have an urge to binge, remember this feeling of fullness in your belly. The feeling of heaviness. The sluggishness. The foggy brain. The salty, thirsty mouth. The exhaustion from unnecessary shame brain. Every little binge behavior is a step down the slippery slope that leads to this low. I do not choose this for myself. This is not how I am going to treat myself anymore.

I could feel the overwhelm setting in. Sourdough starter expanding and spilling onto the counter, demanding my attention. The box of flour I said I was going to say stuff with, demanding my attention. The list of articles and essays and poems I want to write- Demanding my attention, demanding to get out. Deciding to go up to 40 hours/week at my job. My work internally, wondering *how to heal the hateful stories I have been assaulting myself with.* Threats of pre-inauguration armed protests all over the country. And I just want to be free from this world. And I am understanding the true weight of the oppressive force I am trying to free myself (aka all of us) from is absolutely overwhelming. 

In the back of my mind, I want to say, trust yourself. You know how to navigate when you are connected to your body and your breath and the moment, you will know what to do. But when I gorge, when I listen to my body and it leads me to *gorge,* I don‚Äôt know what to trust. The gorging just seems to be a message that I can‚Äôt actually trust my body. It makes me feel incredibly unsafe. 

The thing people don‚Äôt talk about with trauma, violence, abuse (or the conversation I am not hearing yet) is that sometimes it does not have to come from an external source. Sometimes it comes from your very own mind, your very own heart. Of course, the stories that I am telling myself, that are allowing me to cause myself so much harm are not my own. Technically, they came from an external source. But I have been giving them a safe home in my mind and they have certainly been allowed to thrive. Now I have quite a beast to deal with.",1610867658.0

And then it hit me,55,kt5acy,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/kt5acy/and_then_it_hit_me/,9,"I have been a bingeater for most of my life. Things started escalating when I started to live on my own. I could eat whatever I wanted.

So I did. 

So now here I am, after years of therapy, happy with life, but still bing eating. My boyfriend doesn't understand it and is afraid I do so out of stress (and sometimes I do). 

But the problem is, I don't know why most of the time. But now two things came together. The first is that I started intermittent fasting. It means you fast a certain couple of hours during the day and have an ""eating window"". This can be anywhere from 12 hours to 4 hours to one meal a day. A doctor called doctor Fung from Canada came up with it to fight Diabetes and what not. This really changed my pattern because I used to eat from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. Breakfast was the main reason I got out of bed. 

So that was the first thing.

The second thing was something this doctor said about food. (I'm going to be paraphrasing) sugar (and therefore also carbs) and salt make us feel like we need to eat more. Something to do with hormones. Big companies stuff our food with it so that we want to eat more and more. You won't eat a whole pan of bland boiled potatoes, but packets of cookies, chips and goodies? You could eat those all day long and they make you feel good for a moment (again hormones).

Those two coming together. The bland potato story and the fasting made me realize what my favorite food is doing to me. I am perfectly fine before I eat it. After I eat it I can't stop. 

In this interview the doctor explains it.

&#x200B;

The deeper you contemplate the better your results will be. If your food addiction comes from escaping unpleasant things in your life, highly suggest you seek a therapist to get to the root cause instead of covering it up with the pleasure of tastebuds or get into meditation to address the root cause.

Restarting medication,6,kimyt7,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/kimyt7/restarting_medication/,0,"When I (26F) was younger (elementary school and high school especially), I was on Ritalin LA, at the highest dose that you can get. I had a raging case of ADHD, and I never would have made it through school without it. It suppressed my appetite to the extent that I basically didn‚Äôt eat all day, 5 days a week. Then when dinner would roll around, or when I would go out to eat with my friends, I could stuff myself silly and never quite make up the calorie deficit. I functioned fine like that, but when I went off my Ritalin in college, I never adjusted for the lack of appetite suppression. The idea that I could enjoy food at any point during the day, without feeling nauseated or reluctant, was a revelation. I gained over 100 pounds in the last 8 years. Today, I had my annual checkup and I talked to my doctor about starting the Ritalin again. I‚Äôve been engaging in a lot of dopamine seeking behavior, and impulsive eating choices is a part of that. We‚Äôre hoping that with the Ritalin acting as a mild appetite suppressant (I‚Äôm trying a lower dose), and also as a treatment for my ADHD-fueled impulses, I‚Äôll be able to slow my brain down long enough to make food choices informed by my goals and my body‚Äôs needs. 

I‚Äôm scared. I haven‚Äôt been on these meds in a long time, and I‚Äôve tried so many other things. I know all of the science-the healthy eating, balancing macros, self-forgiveness, identifying food triggers, etc. I just haven‚Äôt been able to implement anything long-term, because my need for that hit of dopamine overtakes my rational side so easily.

I can't seem to escape yo-yo dieting. The *only* way I don't overeat is if I'm counting calories. I'll be doing really well, and then I inevitably relapse.

When I'm particularly depressed about my gross body, I starve myself. Which obviously also results in relapsing. I eat generally healthy. I don't let myself buy sugary or fatty foods. Doesn't matter, I'll still go back to binging. 

I was restricting during lockdown earlier this year and I was doing really well. Stayed within my goal every day, lost weight and all. 3 whole months I was doing good. Long enough to form and get used to new habits. Then I relapsed again and gained all the weight back in like a month.

I'm so fucking sick of food, I'm just lying here crying rn. I'm so exhausted. I hate what my body has become but I literally can't fight it. Or at least every single time I try, I fail.

New and looking for advice- after a rant,7,kac5z2,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/kac5z2/new_and_looking_for_advice_after_a_rant/,4,"I have come to the realization I am a food addict. I constantly think about food and dieting. I have moments where I am exercising consistently, then lose steam and in my guilt start binge eating. I have been trying to lose weight all year but it is so hard. I also have PCOS. Sometimes if I overeat, I make myself throw up. I was shocked to find out you still absorb calories, shocked even by doing that. My body is so inflamed by sugar and gluten, also have an allergy to lactose from trying KETO. I walk down aisles of junk food, feeling guilty but still buying the crap. Afterward, I have indigestion, my body feels like it's on fire, my throat is hot and yet I will continue to consume crap.

I managed to stick to Keto for 9 months and lost 66 lbs. However,  I was molested in a club and that made me fearful of people's newfound attraction to me. I have always been a fat girl and so losing all that weight and suddenly being noticed was just a mind fuck. I use to be so much better at this. Perhaps the trauma of that night (nobody saved me from that man, I had to save myself by picking up a bottle of jack daniels and then people ran to save him). I want to be healthy again, look nice, and feel great about myself. However, that moment of powerlessness where some drunken bastard had me pinned down to a seat groping me, has yet to leave my mind- that was 2018. I wasn't even drinking, I wasn't impaired and I couldn't get him off unless he got up himself. It was terrifying. I remember thinking ""Am I this weak or have men always been this strong and scary?"" I made a promise to myself that I would never be in that position again. However I self-sabotage  constantly because of the  fear from that ,night. I was lifting weights, deadlifting 80kgs- thinking of bodybuilding as a hobby and that idiot stole something from me that night. At first, I felt shame, I thought maybe it was my fault. However, why is being attractive permission for assault? Why do I feel shame when I only failed to return the favor and harm him in return? Then I became angry, angry that I didn't crack his skull open, but I guess I wouldn't have been a free woman to even seek this help- I live in China. I ended up in a crippling depression and on the psych ward for care for 5 weeks before the pandemic started. I now have MDD, was on anti-depression drugs that made me so numb to the world I don't even remember half of the quarantine or writing my thesis. I remember that memory stuck on a loop instead.

I want help. I don't want to be a forever dieter. I want self-control back. I want my life back, to be back on track for that bikini fitness competition I wanted to try. I want to look and feel strong again. I want to recover what that piece of shit stole from me. I want life to move past Christmas day 2018, in a club with a stinking stranger trying to rape me in a crowded club where no one tried to help. This is the first time I have shared these feelings. The hate and anguish still feel new. I never stepped foot in a club again, avoid social gatherings, stopped going to the gym, distanced myself from the social circles I was just entering. I was mixing and mingling with people at rooftop lounges, was told I was the prettiest lady at events. Things that never happened before. I thought my mediocre existence has turned around. That I could be the person I always wanted to be. How did I get back to this state? I am sick of it, he got to move on with no consequences. Consequences that only I had because I, unfortunately, sat in proximity to that dumpster fire of a human. He wasn't affected only my life was derailed. People ran to save him from me when I was had to respond with violence. I am over it.

How should I start? Tomorrow I will be starting the sugar detox but after that, what else should I do? What would be the next step? Thank you for the help, sorry for the expletives. I needed to share it. I had to put this out there and get it off my chest. I did nothing wrong. All I wanted to do was spend Christmas with my best friend, and even she let me down by not helping me- but she is smaller than myself so not much she could have done physically. I will get my life back, however this time I won't transform into another victim. I will not suffer alone again. I have finally forgiven myself for not being more proactive, finally getting comfortable with saying what happened and realizing some people are just awful. No one deserves that kind of thing. I will start moving from that point now. I will not be another metoo person trapped in their trauma. I will learn self-defense as I go because IF a bump another predator- I will be the prey that left permanent scars.",1607591132.0

I really need to have a good digital cry,24,k3zppi,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/k3zppi/i_really_need_to_have_a_good_digital_cry/,5,"Hi, first time poster...

I am currently just shy of 280lbs and I'm 6ft.2"" and 31. As hard as it is for me to believe, 10 years ago I was a clothing model. I didn't deprive myself of food during that time; I ate normally but my life was a much happier place and so I didn't turn to food in the way that I have since. 

It's a cycle where I am eating to give myself something to get me through the day, to cheer me up. Ironically, a large part of what makes me so miserable, what makes my days so hard to get through, is looking at what I have done to myself, what I've allowed myself to become and the thought that even if I can turn the tide I've lost some of my best years to looking and feeling awful.

As a kid I enjoyed ""bad"" foods but all that dissipated as I grew into being a teenager and by the time I reached my twenties my eating was generally excellent. Then I got into a very negative relationship and the food addiction began. It started with ""well you deserve to eat the whole cake after the week you've had"", until I reached the place I am in now where getting through the day feels like an immense task.

I'm trying very hard. Today I have eaten only some wholemeal bread and a banana and I will eat a fully healthy fish dinner. However, I've just been told that my grandmother is reaching the end of her life and for all the life of me I want to run to the shop and buy chocolate and ice cream that I can ill-afford just to hold me together.

I'm sorry that this perhaps reads in a really disjointed way; I just need to get this out there no matter how it sounds.",1606755379.0

The worst part is not the added weight. Its being back to the suicidal thoughts and empty life and using sugar to black out from my life.

Going back to college meant finding motivation to work and make money for a life I don't even wanna have for free and the fact that I need to makes things worse. 

Going back forced me to face the reasons I should live and grow and accomplish things which for me is non. 

When I cut off sugar I told myself I don't have to face my mental health or anything or be pressured. I'll just simply replace filling up my time with healthy food as opposed to unhealthy.

I quit sugar because I recognized my addiction. I followed a program that starts off without any added sugars, fruits, starchy vegetables, or artificial sweeteners for the first few days. It gradually adds back in starchy vegetables, then fruit, and then grains and eventually being able to enjoy the occasional sweet. The first few days were rough.

I am also good at making birthday cakes so I get asked to bake something big about every month and 
I am so tired of not having the self control to not taste the food I am making (specially cake frosting).

I did keto for a while and it was great, it felt liberating to not think about food the whole day, but I feel off that horse after developing keto rash and increasing the amount of carbs I was eating and now I don't know how to go back to it.

Afraid to Diet OR Intuitive Eat...,7,jv7aqx,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/jv7aqx/afraid_to_diet_or_intuitive_eat/,6,"I was on the Four Hour Body diet in for a few weeks in October and making progress. Then, out of no where I DERAILED so hard. The last two weeks has been nonstop ice cream parties and basically just shoving everything I want into my mouth. 

The day starts okay - with coffee, chicken broth, protein shakes. Then around 4-6pm I start craving wine and drink a glass, which turns into a bottle throughout the night. It quickly escalates into eating whatever I can think of. Often I go to gas stations and grab a pint of ice cream and consume the whole thing, and start digging into chips, french fries, microwave dinners.

Inevitably, I wake up in the middle of the night having slept terribly. The crappy hungover feeling the next days leads to my doing it all over again to feel better. 

On one hand, I derive pleasure and enjoyment from these nightly weird little food binges I go on. It feels like the only way to 'let loose' and do something fun.

On the other hand, my binge eating feels like some sort of sick self punishment. I know the food I am eating isn't good for me. I know I feel better about myself when I eat healthy. And I sleep better. 

The thing is, I am actually afraid to go back on a healthy 'diet' attempt. I am afraid to deprive myself, knowing that it could boomerang into this awful cycle that I'm currently in.

I'm tired of disappointing myself. My failed diet attempts erode my self trust and confidence. All of this back and forth drama and emotional exhaustion just to try to loose ten bloody pounds.

Looking at MyFitnessPal, I never go over 140, and never go under 130. I would really like to get to a weight of 120-125 just to be on the mid to lower BMI scale for my size. Looking at the weight fluctuations is infuriating because all of this nonstop drama around food, only to never reach my goal, but always feel frustrated, disappointed, and exhausted. How can I try so hard and get no where? 

Vanity aside, this behavior erodes my quality of life. It almost feels like self harm. 

Do I just cycle through and eat all of the foods I crave and want until I don't want them anymore?

I feel like Intuitive Eating could just be a slippery slope into my finding justification for extreme binge eating. 

It is scary to feel so out of control. It is scary to be overpowered by the desire to do this, night after night. 

It seems easy enough to just STOP already, and it always is at first. I will have a few nights where I eat healthy, normal, or don't drink. But inevitably by Thursday or Friday, some unseen force has taken over my brain, commanding me to buy it burritos and mac and cheese. 

I also can't tell if this is food addiction, or alcoholism, or both. Wine is always involved. I love wine. If the only option was beer or hard liquor, I generally don't touch it. White Claw or sweet cider are okay as well, but I don't seek them out. I can't tell if wine causes it, or is an excuse to help me 'lose control' and eat for sport. 

I have two voices screaming in my head now: 

One says, let's start 'The Four¬†Hour Body' again. Do it RIGHT this time. Repent for all of my sins for the last two weeks.

And the Intuitive Eating voice - dieting is futile and only causes weight gain.

Eating shit causes me to sleep like shit. Then I wake up and eat like shit to try to feel better. Then the cycle repeats. I would like to just break the cycle today.

How do I learn how ignore, overpower, or say no to the voices telling me to do this every weekend?",1605535609.0

Having a job now means I earn my own money and have access to food and snacks and sweets way easily than before. I realized I was gaining weight but assumed it was just because I'm getting older and don't have my fast teenage metabolism. (Im 23 now)

And on top of that, I'm a type 1 diabetic. The longest I've gone without sugar was 2 days, and that's probably in the last 4 years or so. Usually what makes me break my self control is when my blood sugar crashes and I go straight for candy or cakes or some kind of dessert. This is probably just a habit left over for when I was younger and used to only be allowed deserts of my sugar crashed.

I now realize that sugar addiction is my issue, and it's not just sweet stuff, just the random mid day snacking because I'm bored and don't want to wait for the next meal.

So here's my question..... What now? I don't think going cold turkey is the solution, but at the same time I want to. I wanna stress that I don't want to eat sugar, it's just that within a few days I know I will feel that craving.

- low carb breakfast
- low carb lunch
- sensible dinner, any carb ok, but must be eaten with 1 hour window.
- no snacking between meals

The overall goal is avoiding carbs for 23 hours/day. Then eat carbs for up to 1 hour, with focus on the insulin release 15-30 min after the carby dinner. No calorie counting, although it does give some guidance, like 1-2 Tbsp of oil per meal, 2 cups of veggies or salad per meal, 3-4 oz of meat per meal.

Weight loss is about calories in and calories out. If you eat less than you burn, you will lose weight. Most of the calories you burn comes from keeping you alive rather than exercise. In fact, exercise is not necessary for weight loss as you can always reduce calorie intake. Here is a website I use for determining how many calories I burn per day (
https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp). Note that as you lose weight the amount of calories you burn will drop.

2) Set a budget for calories consumed. Try to shoot for 500 - 1000 calorie deficit per day. This will allow you to lose 1 - 2 pounds per week.

3) Track the calories you eat (there are apps for this) as best you can, including calories in drinks you have. Tracking can be done upfront if you want to meal prep or after the fact. It is important that you stay within your calorie budget. Once you're calorie budget is spent for the day, you stop consuming calories (food, alcohol, juice, etc.).

4) Don't think you have to eat food you hate. You can eat whatever you want and lose weight as long as you stay within your calorie budget. See If It Fits Your Macros diet for information about flexible diets (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/iifym-guide#what-it-is).

5) Wait 15 minutes before eating. If you feel the urge to consume calories, wait 15 minutes before doing so. I find my cravings usually pass within 15 minutes.

6) Have low calorie density food on hand to help alleviate cravings. I use pickled peppers for my cravings.

7) Try to avoid having extra food around the house. If there isn't anything extra to eat, then it will be harder to overeat.

8) Identify why you want to eat. For me, I often eat because I'm bored, anxious, or depressed. Being aware of these feelings can help turn your attention to the actual problem rather than to using food as a pick me up. Meditation can help with this.

9) Focus on what you can do today (i.e. sticking with you calorie budget) rather than focusing on how much weight you have left to lose. This will help prevent you from getting overwhelmed.

10) Weight fluctuates daily so don't worry too much about individual scale readings. The key thing is that overtime the trend in your weight is downwards.

11) There will be stretches of weeks in which your weight will not change. This is normal, and within a few weeks you will find that you lost like 5 pounds overnight. Stick with the calorie budget, and don't get discouraged.

12) Don't borrow calories from tomorrow's calorie budget. If you overeat today then you overeat. Take the L and move on to tomorrow.

13) Get motivated. Google weight loss transformations. Here is a tread with stories from people like us who got their shit together (https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=108359701). Watch some motivational speech videos on youtube. Do whatever you got to do to become excited about working on your goal. 

14) The first day is the hardest day and the first week is the hardest week. Once you get past these, it's all downhill from there. Eventually your behavior will become habit, which means you won't have to use as much willpower to stick with it.


Other health advice

1) Exercise is good to do for your health. Strength training will help you retain muscle mass as you drop weight. Cardio helps improve cardiovascular health. I usually refer to https://forum.bodybuilding.com/ for exercise related questions.

2) Make sure you get enough protein and fats in your diet. Here is the resource I use for determining how much proteins and fats to get (https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=173439001).

3) Make sure you get enough vegetables and fruit to get your vitamins needs for the day.

4) Deal with the shit that is going on in your life that is causing you to overeat. As mentioned earlier, chances are the reason you overeat has nothing to do with you being hungry. You are likely using food as a crutch to manage the feelings that you have from the shit that is going on in your life. These feelings include, anxiety, depression, boredom, low self esteem, lack of goals and purpose in life. Identify the problem and work fix it.

I've always been into food my whole life. I grew up in a fat family. My father was always skinny until he met my mother and they got married. Now my father has a pot belly. My mother was the child of two skinny parents and she is big however. My brother was always large and I am too. I don't like to drink. I don't do drugs and I don't smoke cigarettes anymore, I barely smoked to begin with lol. I just love food. Diets never worked and I always wanted bad food. I always thought that it was my unhealthy household that caused me to be so big but once I moved out I knew it was me. I have full control over what I eat and yet I am still like this.

When I moved out I was recommended a book about intermittent fasting which I read and began to practice and it worked. However things like temporarily being unemployed, my mother getting cancer, my brother being terminally ill all just kind of got in the way I think? I didn't stress too much, I think I stayed logical the whole time but I think that instead of dealing with the emotions I just ate?

After getting a fulltime job in my field and beginning to really be in charge of myself I lost some weight. I was doing daily walks of about 40 minutes, eating between 12 and 8, very little carbs, stuff like quinoa and from March to July I went from 267 to 240. I was so proud of myself. Then I hit a wall. I stopped losing weight and some weight began to creep up because I started cheating. I lost all determination and now I'm here at 249 and extremely ashamed of myself.

5 days a week I get up early before work and do an hour and a half walk through the park, its like 3.5 miles maybe 4. I drink mostly water and decaf coffee. Yet I'm gaining and I know why. Because I can't help myself. I just think about all the food I want to eat all the time. I can't focus on anything. I just think about chocolate bars and food I can order. Even with the healthy ingredients I buy I still manage to ruin it and make an unhealthy meal. If I'm out I can't stop myself from buying candy or chocolate, it's like I'm on a time release binge or something.

I don't even realize I'm ordering the food or buying it until I'm doing it and I'm like hearing a cacophony ""fuck it"" ""do it"" ""It's just this"" and I am like a robot and I just eat it. Worst part is that I'm still hungry after wards. Why is my appetite so fucking large?

Guys I'm falling apart, I don't want to be like this. Obsessed with food. Wanting to eat all day everyday and be in bed. I'm scared of what I would do if I really lost sight. I feel like a pig and I really hate myself right now. I'm doing this to myself and I can't stop.",1603292095.0

My parents were unhappily married for as long as I lived with them. As my father was prone to screaming fits and temper tantrums, I very quickly found myself on my mother's side during my childhood. (As an adult, I realize that my father is probably on the autism spectrum. I have great sympathy for him now, but that is another story...) 

My mother had two things to which she turned to cope with the unhappiness of her life: shopping and food. She also complained she was terrible cook; I was a picky eater. Thus began the ritual of a bagel and cream cheese from Dunkin' Donuts or chicken tenders from Burger King on the way home from school (we were on a first name basis with the drive-thru ladies) and extended ""beach runs:"" driving along the shore, circling our neighbor multiple times with our snacks, before heading home.

My mother's weight climb to obesity: 5'4"" and nearly 300lbs. She firmly believed that the fault of her weight gain lay with medication that had slowed her thyroid. But if that was really the case, then was the cause of my weight gain? Despite being an active kid and a competitive swimmer, my weight was ballooning. By age 10, I was 150lbs. But my mother buried her head in the sand.

Those ""beach runs"" got longer as I hit high school, trying to avoid the inevitable. Our bathroom butted against my bedroom, and at night I heard my father sob in the shower. My increasingly miserable mother spent more and more money we didn't have. She talked to me about committing suicide together. 

By my junior year of high school, I hit 190lbs at a height of 5'4"". Panicked and disgusted, I turned to Slimfast. Had there been access to food during those days, I would have failed. Because I took no money to school for lunch, my only option was a chalky shake. But at least I succeeded in bring myself back from the brink. I forget the exact weight loss, but I think I dropped to about 150lbs.

I'm now 30, married, and become independent. I've moved to the other side of the world and effectively ended my relationship with my parents, but I haven't been able to stop with this compulsive eating that prevents me from losing those last few pounds and ending this chapter of my life. 

I hate my current job, which is a cause of great stress and strife, which is a huge trigger. I'm taking the necessary steps now to make a career pivot, but that will take at least another 9-12 months. How do I break this stupid cycle?",1603278190.0

I can finally eat mostly regular portions,16,jbzfiq,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/jbzfiq/i_can_finally_eat_mostly_regular_portions/,0,"So, finally cracked it I think. But first a bit of a long winded story. And explanation for context. No tldr for this one sorry, it's emotional and important. If you don't have time or inclination that's cool. Good luck out thier and it gets better. 

I've known for years food was my addiction. But it was also part of my identity. I worked as a chef, I'm everyone's favorite cook, I was the guy who could win eating contests. And as much as it was killing me it was also something I felt somewhat proud of. 

I didn't realize just how much more than a normal person I was eating. Because I didn't binge eat, not really. At least I don't think so. 

My portions were consistently massive. I would eat two double big Mac meals, supersized with four mcdoubles on the side in a single sitting. Regularly. I calculated out numerous meals that clocked in at 10k+ calories. 

I'd never really feel ill after eithier. Sleepy sure, but for me to get sick after eating. I would need to consume truely abominable amounts of food. I'd eat fast food as easily as I'd eat an entire loaf of bread and a roast chicken dinner meant for four. 

My food capacity started when I was a farm boy. On a small hobby farm with my mother. I would work dawn to dusk. Chores, school, work (in a stockyard), chores, sleep, repeat for 10 years. 

I would eat constantly to fuel this level of activity. And I would eat when my emotions were acting up, or my mother would verbally or emotionally abuse me. But it wasn't a problem yet because I actually needed all of this food. I was a massive squat wall of muscle that moved all day. 

I moved off the farm when I turned 17, went to college to be a chef. And suddenly I was free of the constant labour. But, food was still my love and my life. So I kept eating. And now no one could tell me what or how much I ate. So I did things like drink an entire gallon of milk in one sitting (yes for real, I know it's not supposed to be possible. But I did it.) Or eat entire packages of sausages, bacon, or whatever else I wanted. 

But now I didn't have the work, the muscle did what it always does. *Poof*. I gained another third of my body weight in less than a year. But I didn't move like a fat person, so I must not be really obese right?!? Right? I was still strong, just rounder. I'd been called fat all my life as well. So what else was new.   

And the shock, and in some cases awe, or even what appeared to be on some level respect. From the people around me as they watched me consume as much food as a family of four would. Kept me from really approaching it seriously. 

Even the diabetes, and high blood pressure didn't stop me. I just cut out the refined sugars. And that seamed to get my blood sugar under enough control. The neuropathy stopped at least. ( I was 26). I was on a couple basic meds, and the two things seamed to sort the health issue. 

My mood was destroyed at this stage. Undiagnosed ADHD. I'd been chronically depressed since I was 6, also undiagnosed. Anxiety disorder, supprised supprised, undiagnosed.  Mom didn't believe in that stuff. I was just high energy and needed to cheer up. Or do more farm work, literally work me till I couldn't move and go again. I was a draft animal. 

Finally at 28 a friend helped me realize I had a problem. Got on meds for anxiety and depression. They helped me. I started to wake up. But things were still wrong. Still couldn't get anywhere or completley beat my head or my body. Food was the one thing to always love me. 

Now on to the good part. I got diagnosed with ADHD and started biphrentin. Doc told me it would kill my appetite (lol nope). But it did kill my anxiety and depression almost entirely when combined with my strong dose of Escitalopram, an SSRI. And I could focus and think clearly for the first time in 32 years. 

I started working on my health. Really started to realize how badly I was hurting my self. Doc sent me to a diabetes educator. 

And she (also a doctor, of pharmacy in this case)  put me on a GLP1 inhibitor called ozempec. It's expensive and has some nasty side effects at the outset. But it's knocked my appetite out almost entirely. 

Well compared to what I used to be. And people around me don't get it. They don't understand what it's like to be *free*. My stomach doesn't rule me. My money goes so much further because I don't eat *all* of it as fast as I can. I can go to a restaurant and order what I want. Not the largest portion available so I can be full for an hour. The sky has opened and angels are singing. It's fucking beautiful. 

Best we've been able to figure my binge eating and appetite came from a hormone imbalance. Much more severe than normal. On top of the emotional issues, childhood trauma, and  poor habits. 

The inhibitor was like an off switch. And I can finally see what it means to control your eating. The absolute joy I feel when I eat a half a sandwich. And stop because I'm content. And then eat it a few hours later because I'm hungry and it's time to eat. Not because my spine is being forceably ripped out of my rib cage because my stomach is in a rage. 

But the inhibitor is not the cure eithier. It was everything else and that. The SSRI, the self discovery, the seaking help and acknowledging my problem. The support from my best friend. The desire to love my self for once in my damnable existence. Finding the source of my issues, and getting the help I needed. And the tools I needed to get that help.

 The inhibitor was just the most recent piece of the puzzle. And I'm not done this journey yet. I'm dating for the first time ever. I'm gaining rank at work for the first time ever. I don't want to die every day. I have hope, and some confidence. It's rainbows and fucking butterflies.

 But I still have rough days. I'm not cured of any of this and likley never will be. But you know what? That's okay because it's so much better. I just wish I'd been able to get this journey started as a young man. My life would be so much further along. Even that's okay though. Because the future isn't just the silence of a grave stone. I've got a good run too get there yet. 

Things don't get better overnight. No one treatment, pill or diet saves us. It's holistic, something doctors are learning. And it takes time and effort. Pain and suffering. But, *it does get better, and don't you forget it*. Good luck peeps, the world can't keep you down forever.",1602807084.0

Hey gang. 

I have an addictive personality. I eat way too much. I've been trying to cut down for years, but it seems that food is my ultimate vice. 

I had a drinking problem: I beat it. I had a drug problem: I beat it. I used to smoke four packs a day: now I smoke one cigarette each day. I have a problem with porn, hence my user name: I haven't watched porn in three weeks. 

I've managed all that, but I can't go more than about two days without McDonalds. It's never a happy experience either: I'll be talking to myself in the queue, telling myself that this is the last time, and feeling weak and worthless. This never stops me. Each time feels like a sort of relapse, so I binge. I will often buy two large value meals plus a couple of double cheeseburgers.

I think I crave the ""hit"" of salt and sugar and fat. It really is like a drug to me.

I have two slipped discs. It's a long story, but the short version is that my back is never going to get any better, only worse. I am in constant pain. I can slow my deterioration by reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, but I just can't do it.

I eat healthily at home. I'm a fairly good cook: I was a house-husband for a few years, so I used to cook every day. I'm alone now, so I batch-cook healthy meals. I don't keep snacks in the house. I would be doing fine if I just cut out  fast food.

Here's the thing: I've managed to stop porn for three weeks on the NoFap subreddit. I did this partly because they have an automatic day counter, so you can set yourself a target. The day counter is broadcast as a flair next to your user name, so you feel accountable to the community. I suppose I'm wondering if this is an appropriate subreddit to try something similar, to count the days without McDonalds. If not, I wonder if someone can point me to the correct subreddit.

I hope you're doing well, wherever you are. We can beat this thing.",1602495313.0

Really have no clue how I even have a boyfriend.. but he's one of those people gifted with an incredible metabolism. He eats mostly junk. Chips, pizza, fast food, cookies, chocolate, etc. It's felt impossible lately to keep myself away from his treats. He's very sweet and says it's ok, he never minds, etc., which just makes the food monster in me more ""ok"" with eating it. 

It's an awful cycle of self-hated, sadness, desperation, giving up, indulgence, regret, disgust, guilt and shame. I feel like it might be easier to avoid these things if they weren't so easily accessible. But I'm afraid I'm just fooling myself.

Is it crazy to consider getting some sort of lock box to keep his snacks in? It sounds crazy even just typing that out. But what's also crazy is that I feel sick from eating 9 servings of Reese's minis. I'm so sick of living like this, and seeing these tempting things whenever I open the cabinet.

I've battled a lot of addictions, and this one is by far the oldest and most difficult to overcome. My heart goes out to all of you, I hope we can find a path to peace and happiness.",1602387974.0

How do you start over?,3,j4pwtu,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/j4pwtu/how_do_you_start_over/,3,"So like many of you I have always had a problem with over eating. I‚Äôd like to vent and ask for help, and if anyone cares to share their story it is welcome. I‚Äôll try to make mine as brief as possible:

From and early age I would find myself binge eating an entire bag of goldfish chased by soda after soda. I become overweight as a teenager and remained so until I went to college. In my college years I found myself so busy between school and work that I naturally lost weight from simply not having enough time to chronically snack. 

Fast forward a few years and once I graduated and started working full time I did gain some weight back... but I then found group exercise classes and fell in love with the various formats. I managed to loose some weight, however what was more impressive was I was gaining muscle and stamina. I eventually got to the point where I was spending 1.5 to 2 hours 5 days a week at the gym. It was wonderful. I pretty much ate whatever I wanted and didn‚Äôt gain a pound because I would just ‚Äúburn it off‚Äù at the gym. I know that‚Äôs not the ideal scenario for maintaining a healthy lifestyle but that was my balancing act... until I injured myself.

3 years ago I developed a bone spur on my heel that prevented me from doing the high intensity interval training classes I depended on so much (not only for maintaining my weight but also my mental health). 

I became disillusioned and ultimately quit the gym all together. Now, without the gym I naturally would have to change my eating habits to maintain my weight... but of course I couldn‚Äôt. I gained a significant amount of weight back and lost all the muscle I worked so hard to build. 

Now, since COVID and a schedule where can work from home a fair amount... I am the heaviest I‚Äôve ever been and am genuinely uncomfortable in my own skin (5‚Äô7‚Äù 220 lbs female)... but I still can‚Äôt muster the will power to work out (I bought a stationary bike that I‚Äôve used for a total of 3 weeks before giving up.) I still haven‚Äôt been able to change my eating habits for the better... food has become the highlight and the lowlight of my day. It depresses me how much value I give food... and how little value I feel for myself. 

I find myself dwelling on the past... wondering what if I hadn‚Äôt quit the gym. Trying to will myself to have the same enthusiasm for exercising that I used to have. But more importantly, I find myself being extremely hard on myself. It‚Äôs a mindset that if I can‚Äôt give 100% to obtaining my old lifestyle then why bother in the first place.

Ultimately I have never found a solution to my over eating. Working out was just a band aid on a crack in the dam. It was bound to fail at som point and now that it has, it‚Äôs forcing me to ask myself what‚Äôs wrong with me that I can‚Äôt regulate my eating like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people. It‚Äôs basically sent me into a downward spiral that I‚Äôve never experienced before and I don‚Äôt know how to climb out of it.

If you made it this far I thank you very much for reading. I just wanted to get this off my chest as I don‚Äôt really speak to anyone about this.",1601771445.0

First of all, thank you for reading this. Second, pardon me for any grammatical error, English is not my native language.

So i am a  28yo 6'5, 150Kg atm male, that for all his life has been slightly overweight (always just a tad above my ""Ideal Weight""). I used to work out a lot when i was younger, i played basketball and had a pretty healthy lifestyle. Sadly dealing with depression for my entire life, and having a pretty aweful childhood where my parents left me alone in the house while they worked since i was 6 hasnt been very helpful to me. 

&#x200B;

I guess this need comes from my godmother, as she was always looking out for me, and every saturday she took me out to eat something and buy some videogames. As i've gotten older i realized that the need for eating as a reward didn't go away, i always need to get something good (not healthy) to eat...

&#x200B;

When i was 22 years old i was diagnosed with Major Depression, as i was unable to even get out of bed. At that time, things have gotten out of hand. I was eating junk food daily, and had been cheated on with several guys by the GF at the time, so not a pretty moment of my life. It took me over a year under medication to get over that episode.

&#x200B;

Alright, so after giving you guys some context (Sorry about that...), at this time i am happily married, and have a beautiful daugther. But still cant fight the need to always eat something and my wife is getting worried... I've been able to lose weight every now and then, but i always gain it back, and i am tired of it... I just want to feel good with myself and  be there for my child. 

&#x200B;

I was wondering if any of you have gone throught the same thing, and how have you gotten past it? Any advice will be greatly appreciated it, as i dont have the means to do it myself at this time....

I have always battled food addiction, and recently I am working really hard to try and lose some regain so I can hope to get pregnant. My current dilemma, beyond constantly thinking about food and my next meal, is that I have a tendency to over-buy food because I see a good deal (we live on a very tight budget) and then I feel an obligation to eat all of it, often past the point of feeling full, in an effort to divert waste. I like, eat what my toddler leaves, even tho my daughter and my husband don‚Äôt eat the same things that I do.

It ends up that I am like... constantly searching myself if I am hungry or feel like eating or could fit something, and even if I am not hungry I eat, which causes me to massively over consume calories. I feel like this is a better place than BED or OEA, because it‚Äôs not like ONE meal when I overstuff myself, it‚Äôs constantly snacking, and grazing, stuffing myself for every meal. Like I have a catalog in my fridge of what needs to be eaten, it‚Äôs expiration and thus the order it should be consumed before it goes bad, and I know no one else will eat it, so it‚Äôs up to me. 

It‚Äôs clearly obsessive thinking.

Confusing having energy with hunger,16,imhow9,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/imhow9/confusing_having_energy_with_hunger/,6,"Skip to after the line in the middle of the post if you don't want to read so much.

I recently entered a friendly weight loss competition with family members.  We've agreed that the competition will be 8 months long.

There's a little money on the line.  Not so much that people might resort to drastic measures, but enough to keep us on track.  Nobody wants to cough up $10/week and then $100 at the end (about $420-ish in total) without at least trying to stay competitive.

I have been on a carnivore diet for a while.  It's helped me with my food addiction issues.  I never counted calories, or did anything crazy like multi-day fasting.  I just ate ground beef, and bacon, and steaks.  And I used to eat ridiculous amounts of cheese.  But I saw no progress with any weight loss, and I would occasionally feel cravings for carb-loaded foods. Once I cut out cheese and other dairy my food cravings went away.

But I was still probably eating too much.  I can't say for sure.

The competition made me look at what I was eating, when I was eating, and how much I was eating.  Peter Attia had a pretty good video about that on Instagram a while back.  You have to control at least 2 of the 3 levers.

So I dialed back how much I was eating.  I started eating one meal a day.  A giant meal.  But only one.

I had tried OMAD before, but always failed because I was ""hungry"" later in the day.

So now I've moved the time for my one meal.  Never before 3 pm, and usually around 6 or 7 pm.

And now I have a ridiculous amount of energy throughout the day.  I feel like I could go 12 rounds with Ali, and then still run until my legs fell off.  That kind of energy.


**********

So that's the setup.

What does that have to do with the title of my post?

I just figured out that I was confusing the feeling of having energy with the feeling of being hungry, just like we can confuse the signals for thirst and hunger.

I would get a little antsy, maybe feel agitated.  I thought I was hungry, I thought I needed food.  So I would eat, and the antsy/agitated/energetic feeling would go away. 

But I recognize the difference now.  It's been a huge revelation to me.  Like hearing music for the first time or something.

Having energy is not the same feeling as being hungry.

I'm realizing that just changing the food I was eating wasn't enough.  And I didn't need to ""change my mindset"".  How the hell can you change your thinking and your reactions to something you've never experienced before?  I needed to basically start over and learn some new thinking from the ground up.

I think I might be on the right track.  I think I might - with continued work and education - be on the beginning steps of recovery from my food addiction.",1599232272.0
Beating food addiction when you have health issues?,9,im6ugq,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/im6ugq/beating_food_addiction_when_you_have_health_issues/,8,"I have huge problems with FODMAPS and gluten. Chronic IBS results, and gluten also gives me crippling brain fog, eczema and dandruff. Not only very lactose intolerant but any diary gives me severe migraines as well. But the one psychiatrist I went to who specialises in treating binge eating disorder doesn't believe FODMAPS or inflammation issues are a thing. I was gobsmacked when she said that. An entire university department and years of scientific research have validated the effects fodmaps have on people, let alone the evidence provided by the personal experience of millions of people, and this supposed medical expert doesn't believe they're real.

Sorry. I'm still angry about that. Anyway, I was wondering how you've all gone at trying to treat food addiction while having to restrict your diet because of allergies or health issues? 

My stupidly addicted brain apparently can't deal with not eating things that make me sick. The allergic-like reactions have been a fairly recent thing in the sense that I've eaten everything I liked until a few years ago when the IBS and immune responses started showing up and it's been getting worse since. I have an appointment with an immunologist in November, thankfully, but having a food addiction and the necessity of restricting certain foods for health reasons don't go well together. I'm also extremely frustrated by the fact that as soon as any medical professionals know I've got a history of an eating disorder, they don't listen to any legitimate medical complaints I have that relate to diet. Some foods will leave me in agonising pain and/or sick for days, and they'll say don't eat a restricted diet. It's ridiculous and nonsensical. 

Looks like I'm going to have to sort this out myself. I've started taking probiotics and investing a possible autoimmune angle. But mostly I'm trying to figure out how not to give into cravings to eat 'forbidden' foods like dairy chocolate or piles of hot chips or whatever. 

Apparently my brain doesn't care that doing so will make me ill and leave me in pain. I get so much inflammation that I feel 100 years old and bending my knees or any joint, really, is incredibly painful. My hands swell right up, so much I can't wear my rings, and I can feel the swelling and pain all over my body. I get bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea, as well as headaches and migraines. The diarrhoea causes severe leg cramps that are so bad sometimes I can't walk to the kitchen to get electrolytes. And yet! in a few days I might go ahead and spend a whole lot of money I don't have and can't afford to eat food that will do the same things all over again. I haven't learned no matter how much suffering I put myself through. This is full blown addiction.

I was trying to explain this to a psychologist a while back and the summary of her answer was 'well, clearly you don't want it enough'. I didn't know how to answer that. She is a highly educated, normally very sensible person, but here she's suggesting my motivation for change is not sufficiently high or I didn't want it badly enough. I mean, what do you do with that? Here I was, suicidal on a daily basis, in enormous debt and very unwell because of food addiction, being told that suffering so much isn't sufficiently motivating to make changes in my life.

I don't believe that's the case. I don't deserve to be in pain or suffer any more. I certainly want to change my life for the better. But it's going to be bloody hard and I could use all the help I can get.

Luckily, or unluckily, I have this unyielding need to understand everything psychology. When I don't I get irate.

I am dieing to understand ...whats wrong with us?

Were is the loose screw? How is it that despite your best intentions and plans, their is this command that eclipses all of your controls, and takes over your muscles movement and literally lifts our bodies to go and binge. And I'll be sitting on my bed, when the urge hits, trying to understand it - negotiate with it - show it love, do the hoponobono move (self-love), acknowledge it, ignore it - and it doesn't work. It sends my body into anxiety if I don't give into it - its almost like its tied to survival. and I get up, and have that third burger of the day, finish the jumbo size of m&ms.

I know that I'm sending myself to my grave early, I already have PCOS, and could be prediabetic. But that even doesn't stop me.

So I ask, what is wrong with us? Do we have a definitive answer as to whats wrong? Is psychological , biological, physiological? Is there one solution?

I don't know what's wrong with me, or if this is the right place to come so I apologize if this should be somewhere else. My health is becoming really bad. I am 6'3 and weigh over 350 lbs, I am now pre-diabetic, and I have been struggling with a pituitary glad tumor as well as hypothyroidism, both of which I take meds for. I am also on the autistic spectrum if that matters at all. I am scared I am just killing myself slowly at this point.

I feel like I have zero control of myself when it comes to food. I get extremely strong cravings that I can't ignore, they drive me insane for days until I finally cave, and which point I just get a new one the next day and the cycle starts again. I have no portion control, and will eat everything I can get my hands on, no matter my hunger level. I will always order huge amounts of food at fast food or restaurants, or make giant meals at home. I'm wasting so much money, but I feel powerless to stop.

It feels like my brain just switches off, I don't care about anything, any consequences. All I am focused on is experiencing that flavor that I desperately want. I hate myself for being like this, and I know my fiance and my family are scared for my health and life.

I'm not sure where to even start to get help. Should I go to my doctor? Has anyone tried therapy? Has anyone experienced this and gotten over it? I appreciate any feedback, comments, or criticisms, thank you.

Has anyone else gained a problem with food after starting antidepressants? What can I do?,6,if22yu,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/if22yu/has_anyone_else_gained_a_problem_with_food_after/,1,"I was chubby when I was young, and I decided to lose weight when I was 20 and I did, I had no troubles controlling my diet for 9 months and I lost weight very well. But I was also chronically depressed and eventually I went on antidepressants to deal, but now I've lost control of my eating habits and I'm at a point where this is either serious food addiction or binge eating disorder.

I've tried to gradually come off the antidepressants a couple times but due to being chronically depressed, having low self esteem and the struggles of having autism, I crash hard every time and coping without them is impossible. The reason I think the eating problem has stemmed from them is because I noticed I suddenly started eating food that I didn't even like before taking them and I was eating a lot more than before. My weight is now above where it was when I first lost it and my eating is only more and more out of control.

It doesn't help that my situation is different to when I was 20, back then I had full control over what I ate and what food was around me. I'm now with a husband (who I love dearly) who causes me to end up in a lot of situations with food, such as dates, going to his parents for dinner practically every week, party situations, living far away from my own family so we eat a lot when we see each other, even just getting takeaways all the time that he enjoys (but he can because he's so much taller than me, around 6ft and works out on the regular, I work out too but I'm only 5'2 and I can't keep up with my bad eating to keep from gaining weight)

I don't know what to do, I'm completely out of control. Back before the antidepressants I at least had some level of self-control around food but now it feels like I've got zero control, if the food is there, I will eat it until I hurt. It's killing me inside and yet my eating is just getting worse and worse, I feel completely lost, can anyone give any advice? TIA

Am I winning? Hoping this might help somebody,19,ibejmf,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/ibejmf/am_i_winning_hoping_this_might_help_somebody/,7,"TLDR: Try an endocrinologist. Might help.

While I know the cause of addiction can be mental and other factors are there too, I think all this time I blamed myself and thought it's all about willpower. Well. I went to an endocrinologist (hormone doctor) because I was having extreme fatigue and dry mouth. So fast forward. End up finding out I had very high cortisol (stress hormone) and very high insulin. Basically. The reason I was constantly hungry wasn't 100% mental. It was also physical. The more I ate the more hungry I got. The doctor literally used the words ""vicious circle"".

After two months of taking medication I have easily but gradually eaten less and less sugar(almost without trying) and only overeaten once in the last two months. Vs 8 times a day before. And I feel great. I am less stressed and less angry and I can think more clearly. All my mental health issues are a lot easier to deal with. I had chronic pain for years and it just disappeared. I used to be so fatigued I spent over 20 hours a day in bed and now I can sit for a few hours. I am literally happy that I am able to sit without needing to lie down because of back pain and general tiredness.

What's my point. I have a lot of mental problems that led me to turn to food. But it's the sugar that kept me coming back.

If you have time youtube has free documentaries about how sugar causes addiction and how sugar is in so many processed foods that are deliberately designed to make you addicted. They went as far to say that there are documents proving that sugar was known to be harmful at the very start but just like with tobacco the companies hid the facts and now you can get addicted and poisoned anywhere anytime. And yes I mean the sugar.

It rewires your brain and even might cause brain damage. But you probably knew all this already. You probably felt it.

What I wanted to say with this post: If you can afford it, see a doctor. It's a health issue. And it's not your fault. (of course dont ignore the mental side either).

here are some youtube links of helpful stuff to watch:

The Secrets of Sugar - https://youtu.be/K3ksKkCOgTw

Another documentary - https://youtu.be/TLpbfOJ4bJU

Also, something that helped me was to make sure my body is nourished. Even if I am going to overeat and eat addictive food, still I always make sure to have my body nourished first. Nuts and fish. That's minimal sugar, and high fat. Fat. is. good. for. you. Don't go low fat. If you go low fat you go high sugar equals high addiction. And I don't mean fat as in fried food. I mean fat as in olive oil, avocado, nuts and fish. And I know you think it's expensive but buying a small bag of nuts that will last days is far cheaper than buying 5 bags of potato chips that will last less than a day.

Another thing that helped me was to think rationally when I can. Do I want chocolate because of the cocoa and the cocoa butter? Because it has iron, magnesium and antioxidants? I can get that from other food. Oh I don't want spinach? Then all I want is the sugar? Go have a spoon of sugar only then! No, thanks. That's kind of how I try to rationalise things before eating.

Now I still eat chocolate. But only no sugar chocolate(it's sweetend with stevia because it doesnt raise glucose or insulin and still is sweet, watch out for diarrhea though). Eating no sugar and only stevia-sweetened foods if i crave something sweet has made my cravings go down by like 90%.

Now, it's twice the price of regular chocolate but it lasts me like months vs regular chocolate lasts 5 minutes. In the end you save. Both your money and your physical and mental health.

Another helpful thing I did was eating a lot of blueberries. I felt great. I assume the anti-oxidants lowered my cortisol and that felt so great. But then blueberry season ended and I am back panicking. So I guess in the end I really needed medication and I am glad I accidentally got it.

Anyway, if you have any questions feel free to ask me. This stuff won't apply to everybody of course but even if it helps one person thats great.

Non-plan / non-checklist approach to overcoming food addiction,43,i8jyfu,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/i8jyfu/nonplan_nonchecklist_approach_to_overcoming_food/,11,"I've tried to follow a lot of meal plans, etc. I'm terrible at following plans and checklists each day of what I'm supposed to be doing. **I'm way more flexible and free-will than that.**

**Maybe this will ring true with someone else and help them.** 

Over the past year I've been dissecting how my food addiction operates. 

*Step 1 was getting out of a terrible relationship that I was severely depressed in.* Once I was out and feeling normal again, I listed what I call the 'non-reasons' I eat. 

 **Non-reasons I find myself eating:**

¬∑ Stress ‚Äì uncomfortable situations, I eat to soothe myself  
¬∑ Tired ‚Äì either being tired first thing in the morning, or at night when I‚Äôm getting tired, I crave food   
¬∑ Boredom ‚Äì eat just to fill the void  
¬∑ Intense emotions ‚Äì anger, frustration, excitement, I eat to soothe myself   
¬∑ Panic timing ‚Äì assumption that just because I haven‚Äôt eaten for a few hours, that I must eat again, or worrying about future hunger   
¬∑ Specific cravings ‚Äì sugar is the worst culprit (which includes breads, chips, etc as they elicit the same response), sometimes I crave flavours or heavy foods that make me feel very full  
¬∑ Socially ‚Äì if others are eating, I eat even if I‚Äôm not hungry 

**Reasons I should eat:**

¬∑ Hunger  
¬∑ Experience ‚Äì a unique, uncommon occurrence to try something I‚Äôve never tried before

**Then I broke it down to the main reason the food addiction bothered me: unhappiness.** 

Food became more than sustenance and I must tackle each non-reason I eat to overcome food addiction. **It is difficult to tackle an addiction when I will die from abstinence.** 

Eating whatever I want, whenever I want only gives me a few minutes of pleasure (during the moments of consumption). Beyond that, I feel tired, disappointed, and unwell. I obsess about food (what and when I‚Äôll eat next). I am not happy with how my body looks or feels when I engage in this behaviour. **Those few minutes of pleasure from eating are not worth the unhappiness I experience the rest of my time.** 

In my life I am seeking happiness. In many areas I have found greater joy. 

**I live in my body** ***every*** **minute of** ***every*** **day** **and it should bring me happiness, too.** I enjoy being active, wearing clothes that look great and fit well. My body should feel good and function in a way that supports my happiness. 

When each non-reason presents itself, I break it down into why I'm feeling that way. Then I focus on what I actually want. 

**In the beginning there's a lot of quiet.** When food has filled in so many gaps, it will take work to find your real joys in life. I had a lot of emotions to face, too. Try new hobbies, learn new things, take up old hobbies you enjoyed but stopped. 

This has been a year long process for me and I'm reaching a point where I feel like I'm not dieting anymore, that I'm actually engaging in a lifestyle that supports my happiness.

admitting it to myself,15,i6wvj6,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/i6wvj6/admitting_it_to_myself/,8,"i think in order to come to terms with what i likely have i have to write it somewhere that feels tangible. 

i have an addiction to food

throughout my childhood i‚Äôd always had food by my side as living with my grandparents for a time left me with little interaction with other other kids and once i did enter kindergarten food became a crutch to stand on when i felt down because i couldn‚Äôt make any friends.

although i didn‚Äôt realize it at first i would largely ignore how much of something i ate because i was a kid and didn‚Äôt really have self awareness. add the fact that when i did move back with my parents they worked long hours so sports or after school activities where not ideal.

this rolled over all the way until 6th grade when i had long ago realized that i had weight issues. not to mention i was past the point of developing proper social interactions so that snowballed into my weight insecurity. i was never really morbidly obese but i was atleast 45 pounds overweight.

7th grade stared and puberty had started its magic with my growth spurt, i joined the soccer team (i wasn‚Äôt good at all but the running helped), and i stared eating less junk food. eventually began losing weight and while i  never got to my ‚Äúideal‚Äù weight i didn‚Äôt really mind being now only 10 pounds overweight. this remained for 2 more years or what would be this past january. 

i was still on the team(still bad) but i began caring less about what i ate then quarantine hit. 

i saw this as a perfect opportunity to get my dream body. then i was offered a job that required me to do physical labor for a good part of my day. first few days i kept forgetting to pack lunch so i got fast food. no big deal it‚Äôs only temporary i still have months.

april and may pass. i‚Äôve been eating fast for atleast 3 times a week now. and i can‚Äôt get full easily so i eat a while meal. but hey ‚Äúi work hard so i probably use those calories, right?‚Äù

 june,july. my eating habits have gone to trash now. i don‚Äôt hesitate to grab a corn dog or an order of fried chicken now. i snack endlessly and get 2nds regularly. just minutes ago i found myself nibbling at a block of american cheese. i can‚Äôt help myself anymore. if someone offers me unhealthy food i‚Äôll take it with the presence that it‚Äôs only this one time.

i‚Äôm still anxiety ridden to a small degree even if not diagnosable and i find myself in the kitchen looking for stuff to eat. the worst thing is that i know it‚Äôs bad for me but my brain turns off but only to the point where i don‚Äôt care but i know exactly what i‚Äôm doing. 

i just want to stop i don‚Äôt want to go back to how i used to be even if this is just a small step towards a good path i feel writing this down is my best choice at the moment. to acknowledge to myself that i need to do something good",1597028214.0

Before, I sometimes used to attempt to eat slowly by chewing for much longer. The urge to swallow made it very frustrating for me, so I just accepted I would never be able to eat slowly until one day, I came up with an idea. I decided I'd watch my friend eat out of my peripheral vision and time (in my head: 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi) how long she took between bites. So I did. It was **10 seconds**.

So I tried it out. I'd take a bite, drop my cutlery, chew for however long or short I want to, swallow, count to 10 in my head, and continue. It worked. I finished at the same time as my friend. It's not as tormenting as what I was doing before.

So I know it might be a bit too soon but I do feel very strongly that now is a good time for an update. So I tried it. The first three days or so were hard. Very hard - especially since I was surrounded by said addictive foods and offers all the time and was difficult to remember what foods I could and couldn't eat. Around that time I also started a 1200 calorie diet (I have a bit of weight I want to lose) with meal ideas from r/1200isplenty, so in a way I took this experiment to the extreme. After the first three days or so, I still got cravings any time I saw these forbidden foods but my mind created something akin to a wall or block which physically stopped me from having these foods due to the blacklisting. Today something happened. My aunt (who I live under) forced me to go off my diet because it was rude (long long looooooong story). The things she cooked did not involve these forbidden foods but I was/am still very upset about it. Due to my personal experiences around this experiment and the experiment itself, these are the changes I noticed:

1. I do not have a big of an appetite as I thought.

2. I do not really care for food anymore (this is probably because I'm still annoyed that I can't stay on my diet)

3. I eat much more slowly now.

4. The blacklisting of these 10 foods made managing cravings so much easier. There were still a lot of snacks, drinks and fastfoods that did not involve these things but they were not addictive enough for me to not be able to control myself.

I believe I'm going to blacklist these foods for life. I think the way I eat now is how I'm supposed to eat naturally (intuitive eating and bla bla bla). We have to remember that these foods are actually engineered to get us addicted.",1595885237.0

26/7 Sun, Sunny day

So, I have been very depressed lately because of my body image problem. I gained tons of weight during MCO (movement control order) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sigh! When I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw a fat obese girl who is just a food monster who craved for food everyday. Don't love anyone, even herself. INSANE!!¬†

I could feel every inch of my skin, especially belly, thighs, face are covered with fat!! I could feel them jiggering whenever I moved, especially when I went down the staircase. They are like hoping up and down. I feel my arms are shaking like butterfly whenever I moved them.¬†

Not only that, I don't dare to meet my friends and family as I think at the first sight they see me, they will judge me as FAT in their heart! Yes! I am fat af!¬†

Whenever this kinda thoughts come to my mind, the only solution to comfort myself is FOOD! I just wanna devour all the ice cream, biscuits, cakes, snacks, chocolate all day long! This makes me ""happy"" as if I'm at least in control of something. At least, there is actually something I can trust in.

But I realize, this is just a vicious cycle. Whenever I eat the food, I purge. But somehow, I still gain weight, maybe I didn't purge thoroughly out of my stomach, there're still calories being absorbed.¬†

Hence, I realize, if I don't get myself out of this vicious cycle, if I don't save myself, who can save me? I will just be trapped in this black hole until the day I die due to obesity or some other non-communicable disease.¬†

Oh ya, forgot to mention that, I have hyper cholesterol and uric acid and some hypothyroid problem. Whenever I think of my health issue, I feel more depressed as if I am just fucked up everything, so just let my life be a shit. If there is a button to restart my life, how grateful is that. But in reality, there is none. You have to make changes yourself!!!

7:30am, I started to binge through the whole morning starting from the moment when I opened my eyes and purged the food out clearly. I looked at the mirror. I feel like I need to make a change. I realize it is only me who can save myself out. I see hope in myself.¬† Hence, I started by doing a 30min HITT workout to make me feel less guilty and boost my dopamine level.¬†

Ok, i decided to try keto diet to control my appetite as well as lose some weight before the school reopens.¬†

After working out, I drank a bullet proof coffee, cooked myself a healthy lunch and packed it to the nearby cafe to start doing my revision for upcoming exam. Now, I'm in this cafe, thinking of writing down my recovery journal, hoping that this journal can make me reflect more on myself and as well maybe can share my experience to those who are currently encountering the same thing as me. I don't know whether I can overcome it or not, but at least, I have move the first step.¬†

If you are also a victim of bulimia, first stage of change is realization!

Realize that you are so much better than you think! You deserve a better life than being depressed and trapped in this vicious cycle!! COME, join the recovery journey together. Though we may fall, but we stand up together and fight till the end! Believe in ourselves, not any outside sources!

I will try to keep updating this journal and share my feeling and progress to you. See you in the next post. Have a nice day.¬†",1595736477.0

I managed to break a regular soda addiction by pushing through abstaining from it for 2 weeks,41,hw9659,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hw9659/i_managed_to_break_a_regular_soda_addiction_by/,9,"Between 2002 and 2014 I stopped drinking plain drinking water and primarily drank regular soda. I knew it was a problem but the addiction was strong, to say the least. I even remember thinking that I could make any food sacrifice, but don't touch my coke. Signs of an addict.

In 2014, I stopped drinking regular coke for (2) weeks as part of a diet program. At the end of the two weeks I was no longer addicted to coke and haven't drank regular soda again since then. I didn't want it, and I didn't miss it. When I tried it again months later it tasted entirely different --like any other sweet snack and that was the only time I had regular soda since then.

That's when I realized that abstaining from an addictive food for two weeks was the key to breaking the addiction, at least for me. One that before this I literally drank at least 3 times a day every single day.

When I missed it, I just kept telling myself that I could do anything for two weeks. And I literally cried at the end of it when I was no longer addicted. That wasn't even the point. It was just a low carb diet program that I was doing for the two weeks, but it had that unintended consequence. I also lost 10 pounds at the end of the two weeks so that was also a plus.

Every time I go out.,2,hsdukk,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hsdukk/every_time_i_go_out/,5,"Hi.

I have a problem. If I don‚Äôt leave the house, I can somewhat control myself. If I leave the house for any reason, I HAVE to eat something. That something usually tends to be a LOT and it ends up being unhealthy... obviously.

I have lost 50 pounds so far. I‚Äôm half way to my goal. This all happened during the lockdown so it was kind of difficult to get unhealthy food in my household.

Now that things are somewhat more accessible, (although it probably will go back to lockdown soon) I‚Äôve been having to go out to run errands and such. This has become the catalyst to eventual regain of weight.

I have been finding excuses to get out of the house and even if I actually have to go out, I always eat.

Food somehow is so important to me that my productiveness can be completely halted to scheme on how to get out of my house to binge.

If any of you have experienced something like this or have any general tips / tricks... please help.

Thank you so much.",1594920048.0

\*I'm 15, around 78 kg, 5 foot 9/10, and male. I don't look fat/chubby, but my weight is concerning me.  


Ever since a young age I've been eating chips for pretty much all my life. I used to have it made at home, and only ate chips at restaurants for quite some time, until I thankfully developed more tastes. I'm worried for myself, because its starting to take over me, and its scaring me. I really am trying my best to quit eating chips so often, because diabetes runs in my genes, and I gain weight very very quickly. Due to the uncertain situation I'm not even able to play sports anymore, and any type of exercise on my own is very mundane to me, even thought I've been going out cycling for around 20-30 mins a day at around 16km/h. I started ordering frozen chips, which I've been cooking in an air fryer instead of deep frying them, and cut back on takeaways massively, with ordering maybe once a week. I'm still gaining weight however, and I want to change, but I can't find myself to move and I feel like I have no energy to. I don't expect any remedies but rather using this forum to allow myself to vent, but any help/motivation would be highly appreciated, and if anyone could recommend foods/recipes which i can incorporate in my diet to build muscle and lose fat.   


I really hope that I can change my lifestyle, because I don't want this to be my life.",1594810463.0

I‚Äôve never really been much of a snacker. We didn‚Äôt keep snacks or soda or desserts in the house when I was growing up, and so I never really bought those kind of foods for myself as an adult. My problem has always been portion sizes of meals, and choosing to eat high calorie shit at meals. Emotional eating, looking forward to a big meal to unwind from a bad (or just boring) day, food as a reward, all that.

The thing is, I‚Äôve tried plant based, Keto, 1400 calories a day, Noom.....and through all of those things...I‚Äôll be great with it for a month and half straight. It‚Äôs not hard, I don‚Äôt really crave anything or struggle, and then suddenly a month and half in I hit a wall where the very idea of planning a meal prep/grocery trip or tracking one more goddamn calorie is suddenly overwhelming and I just break. I‚Äôll spend 3-4 months fucking up, unable to put forth any effort at all, and then I‚Äôll feel like shit and start over. 

The problem is....I keep developing worse and worse habits anytime I break. After Keto I suddenly got obsessed with Ben and Jerry‚Äôs ice cream out of nowhere and started eating a pint like twice a week. Stopped once I started counting calories, and then after a month of being good with no problem, fucked up, started ubereatsing like crazy, went back to the weekly ice cream...and starting snacking at work via vending machines. Like eating 3-4 things a day from the vending machine in addition to the lunch I bring. Eating shit I don‚Äôt even like (potato chips, poptarts, dry ass cookies) every day. Started Noom, shed the habits relatively effortlessly, got that sudden overwhelm 2 months in, gained back all the random habits...and started drinking soda.

This go around I‚Äôve started fucking SMOKING. I‚Äôm so annoyed that I‚Äôm now eating all these things I‚Äôve never liked before or had problems with. I‚Äôve tried just dropping the bad side habits themselves without changing my bad meal habits, but I don‚Äôt seem to be inspired to drop anything unless I‚Äôm thoroughly dedicated to eating better.

How do I stop my sugar addiction?,19,hokhkr,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hokhkr/how_do_i_stop_my_sugar_addiction/,5,"I must admit that I have a big problem. It‚Äôs followed me throughout majority of my life. I‚Äôm addicted to sugar. Lots of it. I‚Äôve tried quitting sugar all together, replacing sweets with apples, or replacing sugary stuff with low calorie versions, I tried slowly reducing the amount of sugar I ate over time, and I tried making myself do pushups or run laps if I had any sweets.

I‚Äôve even set up my house with no other sweets but fruits such as clementines, apples, and blueberries if I‚Äôm craving. I make it as hard as possible to get sweets. If I want sweets I have to leave my house in blistering summer heat. Yet I still do it!?!?!

My biggest problems are pastries and bubble tea. And they‚Äôre very specific. The only pastries I‚Äôll eat are the raisin twist and coconut buns. If it was anything else I would deny them.

Things I have done to help stop my bad eating habits,35,hn0n3b,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hn0n3b/things_i_have_done_to_help_stop_my_bad_eating/,8,"Hello all! Last October, I had a major relapse into my food addiction, and this has been the second worse relapse in my entire life. Over the past 7 months, I have been gradually trying to break free from this, with a surprising amount of success. Lately, I've had minimal slip-ups and managed to lose 10lbs! Here are a few things that helped me specifically. I am not saying they help everyone, but they have massively helped me.

1. First of all, I realized that a big problem for me was being able to have easy access to buying whatever food I wanted at any time. I can't exactly shut down every restaurant or store in my area just for my sake, so I realized I needed to **restrict my access to my money**. I opened a saving's account and had the majority of my paycheck go immediately to it, out of sight, out of mind. I only had just what I needed go to my checking account, and I refused to open a credit card. This forced me to adhere to a strict budget without room for food I shouldn't be buying.

2. I decided to set one rule of thumb 'no buying food from restaurants.' Doing the above forced me to stick to this rule, since food from restaurants adds up quickly in costs. Due to the coronavirus, I haven't had to put much effort into avoiding restaurants.

3. I realized I can't trust myself to always make the right choices when it comes to buying food. Stepping into a store almost guarantees I'll walk out with at least 1 food I shouldn't be eating. Even with a list, glancing at a bag of chips for too long may do me in. Ordering groceries online is the best way to go about it for me. I have my 'list' already saved to my account so I don't even need to browse to add things to my cart. Just hit order and it's good to go.

4. I've formed a diet for myself based off of my dietary needs and what works best for my body. This includes excluding a great deal of foods, including *all* processed foods and sticking to a 95% keto diet, which might not work for everyone, but it's what I had to do. I am the type who must cut out all junk foods completely - I cannot do moderation. It may be different for you. This took me MONTHS to finally do. I had to cut out certain groups of food one group at a time until I finally was 100% within the bounds of this diet. This isn't to lose weight; it's to stay healthy and avoid another relapse.

Lastly, I wanna note that I did not work with a doctor, dietary expert, or therapist throughout any of this. I highly recommend doing so if you have the time and resources. I suppose I'm lucky in that I never became overweight as I always manage to fight my way out of a relapse before it gets to that point. However, being overweight doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy and being unhealthy doesn't necessarily mean overweight. Despite being 125lbs, I ended up with high cholesterol among other issues. Because of my autoimmune condition, food addiction could kill me if I don't fight to control it.

These are just some general tips that worked for me. Again, it's different for everyone, but I thought sharing my experiences might help a few people out there. Good luck everyone! :)",1594148115.0
My experience/battle with food addiction.,13,hn45go,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hn45go/my_experiencebattle_with_food_addiction/,2,"\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\* This post discusses my personal experience and battle with food addiction. If you want to use it as advice, that's awesome. However I understand that everyone faces their own unique circumstances, and not everything works for each person. \*\*END DISCLAIMER\*\*

HI friends! I wanted to share how I've managed my food addiction, including the realizations I made, the steps I took to become healthier, and some persistent issues that I'm facing.

At first, I wasn't including sufficient nutrients to feel satiated and healthy (particularly protein). I wasn't drinking nearly enough water. Also, I wasn't eating a large enough quantity of food. As I didn't eat often enough, I always felt hungry. I would usually eat breakfast when I got up, then go 5-6 hours before lunch, then 6 more hours before dinner. I usually ate small breakfasts and lunches, then large dinners (and huge amounts of ""treats"").

It stood to reason why I could come home and eat a whole box of crackers, or bag of potato chips, 6 apple strudels, etc.!

I learned some basic knowledge about healthy eating - which nutrients are beneficial in which ways, how to read nutrition labels/what ingredients to look for, and how to schedule my eating. How to create meal plans and budgets, how to select cheap and quickly prepared foods. I changed my diet to reflect this knowledge- as I added the water and nutritious food, I decreased my snacking.

I also started meal prepping, and bringing food with me in Tupperware containers. I started eating larger breakfasts and lunches, then two smaller meals after that, usually with3-4 hours between meals. While I had mild trepidation around eating and drinking in public, I quickly overcame this when I realized that nobody was staring at me, and the health benefits outweighed any possible awkwardness.

With the diet change, I became motivated to take better care of my health with consistent sleep and exercise. This increased my general willpower and made it easier for me to say no to destructive eating patterns. I saw the big picture of good health compared to one hour of fun eating followed by massive guilt.

Speaking of guilt, I learned how to reframe my thought of food- not making it an emotional or moral thing, just focusing on **facts and how the food affects my health**. It has virtually nothing to do with ""society"", morals, or even looks. I stopped thinking that my eating patterns inherently made me a better or worse person (however, eating healthier gave me more energy and made me more pleasant to be around haha). This is for ME and MY health. I know that I feel better and have more energy to accomplish tasks. Keep in mind, that DOESN'T mean I took the fun out of food with the idea that ""food is fuel"" and nothing else!

I continued to find enjoyment in food, by learning fun, nutritious recipes and simple ways to make everyday food more exciting. I didn't get bored eating the same bland chicken and rice all the time. Learned how to season my chicken in different ways. Spiced up my morning eggs with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, chili powder and onion powder.

Tasty and healthy. There is a sense of pride and accomplishment in learning how to cook things you actually enjoy eating. I figured if dinner is fun, no need to have dessert all the time.

On that note, I also tried to find enjoyment in other aspects of life besides food. I looked for ways to get more involved in my community, and tried new hobbies.

While I saw a significant improvement in my habits after improving my diet, some behaviors persisted. I still struggle with these, and I'm gradually coming up with methods of stopping. Sometimes I have backslides, but I don't get angry at myself. I'm still doing better than I used to overall.

**Stressed, working on a difficult task** If I had to force myself to do an essay or a task I find unpleasant in a short period of time, I would bring a whole bag of chips (at least) with me. Now, I try to start projects well ahead of time, devoting a little bit of time each day, so that I don't get overwhelmed. If I still ""need"" a snack, I opt for carrots or dried fruit with no added sugar.

**Relax/reward myself at the end of the day** I decided that caffeine-free tea was a nicer way to unwind, I slept better than when I would eat cupcakes or cookies. Choosing different flavors of tea is fun. If I can't get tea I implement other (non-food) rewards, such as watching funny videos, reading books, or drawing.

~~Every time~~Sometimes after I eat at home, I think why not **""top it off"" or ""have dessert"".** As it truly takes a lot of food to make me ""feel full"", I don't trust that sensation. After I finish my food, I try to start washing the dishes and cleaning up the area asap. This gives me something else to focus on, and if everything is already cleaned up it's less tempting to get more food.

Generally, I try to eat at certain times, and stop eating or snacking after a certain time, (usually around 6 pm). If I really didn't have time to eat before and missed a meal, of course I make an exception.

Honestly, being in quarantine has rekindled a lot of these behaviors. Sometimes I feel like my life revolves around food. Making a pretty tight budget helps so I can only buy the healthy foods, and avoid the treats. I do make room for treats less than once a month though, just for fun. When at home, I try to eat in my kitchen only - no food in front of the TV or in my room!

Well I hope this was a good read, please let me know if you have any questions or comments! Have a great day!",1594159335.0
Parents are unhelpful.,7,hmtybl,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hmtybl/parents_are_unhelpful/,5,"As the title says, my parents are hell-bent on not helping with my addiction. This is half-venting, and half-me soliciting advice. 

I've graduated from college and am trying to get into graduate school. For now, I'm living with my parents, unable to work because the only line of work I'm qualified for is high-risk for coronavirus and both my parents are immuno-compromised. Basically I am stuck until I can get into school next year.

When I was at school, I lost a lot of weight. I learned as long as I don't keep food in my apartment, I won't think about food or eat out of boredom. I ate 1200 calories in dollar menu fast food, coupled with vitamins and fiber supplements to lose 50 lbs in about four years. I was exercising, and I was getting close to my goal weight of 160lbs. Only problem is that whenever I come home, my parent's lifestyle creeps up on me and I eat an obscene amount of food. You see, my parents cook about four meals a day, and leave snacks out all the time. My father BBQs twice a week, buys a dozen breakfast tacos every Saturday (bEcAUsE iT'S tRAdItiON), and prepares a huge brunch every Sunday. Every morning he gets fastfood breakfast. He shouldn't even be preparing all this fattening food because of his pancreatitis, but he eats his share, vomits it up the next day, but expects us to eat our own share of food to make up for his smaller portion. My mom is no better; she's the one who leaves out snacks all the time and gets pissy when I try to hide them to keep them out of sight. My father loses weight because of the pancreatitis, while my mom, brother, and I all pack on pounds. Every time, I came home for winter or summer break, I gained at least twenty pounds. It was a harrowing cycle of losing twenty pounds, putting them back on, and losing them again, etc. Now that I'm back home for a whole year, I'm afraid it's only gonna get worse.

I've asked my dad to cool it with the cooking. If my mom is gonna keep getting snacks, at least I can get rid of fattening meals right? Nope. He was LIVID. He felt like I was personally attacking him and his cooking. I pointed out he's a good cook, but that was the point - I needed to eat less. He got upset and told me i just needed to keep my mouth closed, failing to understand the nature of an addiction. I pointed out that when I was living away from them, I lost weight just fine and that the whole point was to not leave food out, but by that point he was just fuming. If anything, he doubled down and ordered pizzas the next day. I tried talking to my mom, since she was also disappointed in her weight gain. My mom listens to prosperity gospel preachers, and told me that her pastor explained how through the word of God and self-control, his daughter was able to overcome an opioid addiction (sadly, she relapsed). If I wanted to lose weight, just show some self-control! I said if we had any self control, we would throw away the obscene amount of food we left out, but she was mortified at that. She grew up poor and the thought of not having enough food scared her to death. So talking to them does not work.

Since coming home last winter, I've put on all the weight I lost and then some. I'm the heaviest I've ever been. A year ago I was confident enough to go on dates and go out clubbing. Now, I am praying I don't get type 2 diabetes before the age of thirty. I feel shitty for being ungrateful for my education and living space, but my mental health has gone to shit with the weight gain and living with them. Any advice? This is a long rant but I just needed to vent.",1594126254.0

A few weeks ago her and I went to lindent chocolate store to get stuff for a gift basket for our friend. She ended up buying 150$ worth if chocolate that was 80% off, it was two large bags full. I managed to control myself and only buy a small bag worth, I was extremely proud of myself because on top of that I gave half mine buy away. 

Skip forward to this past weekend, we have a little get together and this friend brings one of the huge bags of chocolate, like this bag has 100 lindent chocolate balls in it. She insists on leaving it at my place, says she has no room. I‚Äôve confided in her many times that I have this addiction and that it is imperative for me to get control of it to loose weight. About 5 years ago I lost 160 pounds, and I thought things were going to be great because I was working SO hard but that‚Äôs when I got sick, the more weight I lost the sicker I got. Turns out I have a rare genetic disease and because I was abused and neglected my health and the pains I had growing up. Because drs kept brushing off my symptoms because I was fat my genetic disease caused a fuck ton of damage and there for lots of other comorbidites so after I got sick I quit loosing weight because my mobility started to suffer horribly and the pain kept getting worse. 

I managed to keep the 160 off for 3 years, then I started to gain bits back but I stayed relatively stable. But the last 6 months I‚Äôve been on new medication that has made me gain 30 pounds straight, I don‚Äôt know what to do, I need to loose weight but it feels like no matter what I do I just can‚Äôt break even in any way.",1593494306.0

I'm worried about my mom,19,hacfem,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/hacfem/im_worried_about_my_mom/,6,"Im sorry if anything i say come off as fatphobic. That is not my intention. My mom has been morbidly obese my whole life. It's always just been a fact of life. Something I didn't even question. When i was about 8 (I'm 24 now) she did try to lose weight with better diet and exercise, but it didn't really work and that was when she officially gave up ever trying to reduce her body fat. Up until recently it just wasn't something I cared about. She's an adult, if she'd rather live that way it's her prerogative. But in the last couple years she's had a severe decrease in mobility and a monumental increase in daily, constant pain. I wouldn't be surprised if she was bed ridden within the next couple years. She's tried massage, and cortizone shots for her joints, and chiropractic care, and other medications. But actually addressing the the root of the issue, the fact her body cannot function under its own wieght, has basically been taboo. Both my father and I have not even brought it up for fear of insulting or hurting her and knowing she is very unlikely to show a desire to make lifestyle changes to promote fat loss. 

I'm just really as a loss for what to do. It's her life, should I just let her live it how she's comfortable? Should I try to confront her? How could I in a productive way? I'm just scared of losing my mom, whether its because I insult her so much she shuts me out, or because she can't even leave the house and live her life, or literal death because her body is failing. 

Any advise would be appreciated. And again, I'm sorry if I said anything that came across as fatphobic. I'm a bit curvy myself and have nothing against extra fluff. I'm  just worried about my mom's health.",1592340581.0

My Road to Recovery,22,h7bxf8,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/h7bxf8/my_road_to_recovery/,4,"Hey everyone. I‚Äôm new here, and am currently recovering from an 8+ year binge eating disorder. I‚Äôve gone almost a full month without binging, and feel confident I won‚Äôt binge how I used to ever again. I‚Äôm not an expert and still am learning and growing,  but I wanted to share my experience and hope that it helps even one person with their own struggles.

For around 8 years I let fast food ruin my life. Every day, or every other day, I would eat a 1,600-2,000 calorie fast food meal, with a large soda, multiple sandwiches - everything. I gained a lot of weight and really hated myself. At my heaviest, I weighed 335 pounds, and gained over 80 pounds of that in a single year.

I hid eating from my family and friends, and hated myself for it. I would eat 1,500 calories of fast food on my way home from work, and eat another full dinner so that my parents wouldn‚Äôt suspect anything. I let myself spend money I didn‚Äôt have. I felt trapped, and no matter how hard I tried, how well I rationalized with myself, how much I really, truly wanted it, I couldn‚Äôt quit. I imagined having kids and trying to figure out how I would manage to binge eat without them finding out and wanting to do the same. I came up with excuses for coming home late after a binge months in advance of when I‚Äôd need them My binge eating disorder felt like a cloud that was going to hang over the rest of my life. I was resigned to gaining weight slowly for the rest of my life until there wasn‚Äôt a road back to normalcy left to follow.

After my first therapy session last month, I looked online for books about binge eating disorder, and found a medium post about a book called Brain Over Binge. The post described feeling uncontrollable urges the way I‚Äôm sure that many of us do, and said the book helped her stay binge free for 2+ years, and recover quickly. I bought the book, but cynically. I didn‚Äôt expect results and figured I would at least begin dragging myself towards recovery. I finished the book in two days and haven‚Äôt binged since. There are a lot of resources online related to that book that I‚Äôll link below, but finding a new way to frame my eating, and new ways to quell my urges has worked for me. It used to be that I couldn‚Äôt go three days without a fast food meal. I used to feel hopeless and worthless and sad and resigned to the damage my eating would cause. I‚Äôve lived the past month free from my disorder for the first time in almost a decade. I hope this post makes you feel that recovery is possible, and please feel free to comment or DM me if I can be of any help to you. Nobody has to walk alone here.

Coming to terms with my addiction... Any advice?,18,h14auj,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/h14auj/coming_to_terms_with_my_addiction_any_advice/,3,"Sorry I'm gonna spill some info about myself because it all goes hand in hand with food addiction.

I've been addicted to food for a long time. I was ""normal"" before third grade, but a year's worth of abuse from a teacher really messed me up really bad. Already coming from an abusive home life to an abusive relationship with a teacher... Not good. I turned to food. I would eat so much. I've gained so much weight. I'm only 24 and I have no doubt in my mind I have a heart disease. I'm just over 300lbs. I feel worthless a lot and the only thing I look forward to every day is meal time. I don't eat as much as I used to, but I eat a lot of carbs. I don't ever feel full if I don't stuff myself with noodles or bread. Balanced meals aren't enough to make my growling stomach be quiet for longer than an hour or so. 

If I'm craving something, I HAVE to have it. If I'm craving spaghetti but all we have to make at home is chicken ramen, I will get sick. I dry heave and my throat refuses to swallow a single bite. If I can't satisfy my craving, I don't eat that day. 

These craving fits don't happen all the time but when they do... That's when I end up binging. When I get that spaghetti I eat multiple servings. I don't stop until I feel like I'm going to pop. The binge gets especially bad if I try to ignore the cravings for days or weeks. During the craving standoffs, I barely eat so my appetite grows more and more. 

I've tried dieting. But my fiance√©... She's blessed with a great metabolism while I'm convinced I don't even have one lol. She buys a lot of junk food that I probably shouldn't be around. We always go to pubs or Italian places when we go out to eat. I am constantly surrounded by temptation. I've talked to her about it and she agrees to eat healthier for about a week before bringing something home that we agreed we shouldn't have. Fiancee does want to eat better because even though she's thin, she is not healthy. Her words not mine. 

So I guess I'm here to ask for help. How can I avoid all these foods when I don't feel full unless I eat them? How can I successfully combat the cravings? What are some good ways to lose some weight when one is very obese?

I have developed disordered eating due to IBS, so now when I eat I have panic attacks due to the repercussions I'm going to face. This caused me to stop eating entirely. 


Only to return to binge eat all the foods I'm not supposed to have. Poptarts, cookies, ramen, sub sandwiches. Then I'm sick again for a few days, rinse and repeat. 


I'm trying to convince myself that FOOD IS FUEL. I'm so wrapped up in this idea that everything I eat MUST be delicious. I can't just eat grilled chicken. I want fucking fried chicken. 


I'm now back on a restricted diet called low fodmap. I always feel great while doing it, but eating the same foods over and over causes me to ""relapse"" and I start eating whatever I want again. Then I get sick and it's just a vicious cycle. 


I know I'm not struggling with the exact issues as everyone else, but this is really affecting my life. I can't stick to a diet that benefits me due to my inability to see that food is just fuel.

This isn't a knock on them, it's just that they cannot comprehend this insatiable desire, and I think there's not enough information out there about food addiction.

As a recent example, my wife baked cookies.  I would prefer that she didn't, but I'm not going to deny someone else the opportunity for cookies!
She knows about my addiction, but still asked me if I would like one.  I said ""no thank you"" and my wife, knowing sweets are a triggering food for me, STILL insisted I have ""just one"".  I sat her down and tried to explain that for me, I can't have just one.  I need to have 30 until I feel sick and bad for myself.

I know my wife was just proud of her cookies, and sees them as a source of happiness that she wanted to share with me. 

Would you ask a recovering alcoholic to have just one beer, or a recovering heroin addict to share just one hit?  Of course not.  Food addiction needs more attention so maybe people will begin to understand.

I had my doctor's appointment today... It honestly went so much worse than I thought it would. 

I told him everything, what I'm looking for (a game plan and skills I can actually use,) and he essentially told me I should destigmatize food, eat whatever I want, and stop restricting. The only helpful thing he had to say was that my weight isn't my responsibility, which does help take pressure off on me. But there was nothing else, nothing to help me actually destigmatize food. Nothing to practice. 

It feels like I'm an alcoholic that just got told to stop drinking. I haven't been able to stop crying. I honestly don't know what to do. I asked for a skill, just one to practice, and he had nothing to offer. I'm so distraught.

Im in my 30s and have struggled with using food to cope since i was a child. Looking back I can see some things that my parents did that probably started this. But I know very well that there wasnt much information on food addiction, or even nutrition when i was a kid.

I remember my mom taking me Mcds to school because i was crying and didnt want to be there. I remember we would get fast food after doctors/dentist appointments. I remember my father obsessing about my weight. Constantly talking about it and judging everything I was eating. I still remember that he said I was so fat that i looked like a beast. I wish I was making that up, but even my sister remembers him saying that. I have gotten closer to my dad now that I am older. But he has compounded a lot of the issues I have. In my 20s, he told me that I would never find a partner, because my personality is too much like my mothers.

I know, i completely understand that my current situation is my fault. I choose to continue going down this path. I was just reading up on food addictions and started wondering when this all started.

Now i am in my 30s and on my own. My mother passed away from pancreatic cancer 3 years ago. That was probably the most difficult thing I have ever gone through. My mom was the one person that truly understood me. She never stopped trying to help me live a better life. But I have been so lost.

&#x200B;

I found out last year that I have abnormal cells in my uterus (caused by low progesterone, since i have never had a normal female cycle). I have a chance of developing cancer. I am on medication to try to reverse this, and the pills cause intense hunger. So i have gained even more weight than before.

&#x200B;

I am tired. All i want to do is sleep. My body physically hurts, just walking a little bit makes me tired and out of breath. I sleep all night and have to take quick naps during the day (working from home due to the quarantine). When i was working, i would nap during lunch hour.

Theres two halves of me right now. Theres the part of me that wants to be free of this compulsion to eat. That wants to be healthy and strong, and give my body the chance to fight this illness. I dont want to end up sick like my mother.

Theres the other half of me that cant even imagine changing. I know this sounds horrible, but food gives me comfort. When i am scared, angry, sad, or feeling lost, food makes me feel safe. It gives me comfort and helps me to keep going. Im crying, because i know what i am doing is destroying my body and yet i dont know if i can stop.

Talked with a fellow Redditor. I wanted to share my answer to maybe help others who struggle (Contains information about intermittent fasting),21,gjzcl4,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/gjzcl4/talked_with_a_fellow_redditor_i_wanted_to_share/,1,"First off I just want to say I understand the topic of fasting can make some people upset as they equate this to an eating disorder. I want to make it clear that intermittent fasting IS NOT an eating disorder but merely choosing WHEN to eat. I am not interested in arguing with anyone but I am always happy to have a discussion and answer from my own perspective to have a real talk.

  \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The biggest question I have is why are you doing fasting? Is it to take control of your eating?  Are you doing this to lose weight? Or maybe to just be more healthy overall?

I think the first thing I want to talk about with you is your mind. I am not selling you a faith system or anything like that but we are often very hurtful to ourselves in our own heads. I often joke with others that if I talked to you the way I talk to myself you would hit me. I think that is true for many of us. As I said before we get ourselves in these mental patterns of self-sabotage out of fear. Fear of discomfort, of failure (we think it is better to fail now, than later), out of lack of self-trust, etc.

A huge help to me has been listening to talks by a man named Alan Watts. This is the one that has helped me the most and I show to all my patients as they are detoxing from their drugs of choice. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emHAoQGoQic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emHAoQGoQic) ‚Äì Alan Watts ‚Äì The mind is a vicious circle.

I think the hardest truth to learn in our journeys is that you cannot avoid in some way suffering. Merely appreciate it as the opposite side of the coin to life.

So I ask you to reflect on yourself and ask yourself what is your main goal? What are some smalls steps you can do to get there starting now? Could you create a thought journal around your hunger, logging your emotions as you notice the drive to eat comes up? Can you reduce the amount you eat from as an example 6 times a day (including snacks) to 5 times or 4 times? and slowly reduce the overall amount over time.

I think by people being so wrapped up in the guilt and shame of not being able to get past this hurdle you are blocking yourself. It is my opinion you have to not take this so seriously. 

A huge comfort to me was understanding that hunger comes and goes but the intensity decreases overtime with fasting. I included the video about how to quit sugar not so much about the sugar but about hunger and techniques to get past it overall. So as you go through watching just replace sugar with hunger in terms of the understanding you are not depriving yourself of anything.

Quarantine trauma = food addiction epiphany,19,gjqk1s,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/gjqk1s/quarantine_trauma_food_addiction_epiphany/,12,"...well, epiphany might be going too far. I've known I've had a problem with binge eating since I was..16? 17? I'm in my 30s now, and covid 19 saw me being forced to leave the country I had lived in for years, with no notice to get used to the idea or say goodbye properly.

Since then it's been a steady pattern of eating, eating, eating...sugary food to the point my heart is beating faster, as I've spiked my sugar level so much.

I guess I am eating a lot due the familiarity of it; a sense of ""normal"", because it's something I've been doing for so long when I've been sad, lonely, bored, stressed...etc etc.  Eating sugary foods is numbing the grief of leaving what had become my second home.

But it's getting too much now. It's now a miserable necessity to buy sugary treats as apposed to enjoyment. I am very much an all or nothing person; I have an addictive personality (quit smoking and yes, that's not helping the sugar cravings) so I know I have to go completely cold turkey and abstain from sugar completely.

Just could really do with support and fellow understanding :) 

Edit: sorry if mentioning sugar abstaining was triggering because it sounds like I'm trying to restrict food as well, which is never a good idea. I'm still learning the best way to recover and heal.

Pattern of weight gain?,1,gg9bel,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/gg9bel/pattern_of_weight_gain/,3,"So I have noticed a pattern of weight gain in myself. I will hold a weight without even trying for a period of time, the last one being nearly 4 years, and then all of a sudden I'll shoot up 15-20 lbs. 

I'll think this weight is unacceptable, this is where I draw the line, attempt to get alllll the weight off for a while, keep quitting because of my food and sugar addiction and then just accept it and go back to full feed and eating whatever I want and however much I want. 

Here is the pattern and things I can remember with each:
2007- I was 17 and went on birth control. I already thought I was fat. But I went from 160's to 175 in a matter of months with no other changes to diet or exercise. 
2011- college, junior year I stepped on a scale and bam, 190. I had held 175-180 all three years of college thus far and had no life changes when the weight flew onto me. 
2013ish-205 No changes to lifestyle AT ALL
2016-220 same thing. 
2019-I had a baby. Highest weight while pregnant was near 250. Eating whatever I wanted the whole pregnancy and only gaining 30 lbs, I thought: not too shabby. 
Shortly after having baby I lost weight really fast. At one point I remember being down to 210 and so happy about it. I continued breastfeeding and eating whatever I wanted. Indulging any craving. The weight crept back on until I was back to pre pregnancy weight. 
2020-I noticed my wedding rings were tight and uncomfortable and realized I should weigh myself. I was 237. Highest weight I've ever been not pregnant.

I have a family history of type 2 diabetes and that body type where all my weight is in my waist. My legs are still not so bad but arms and face/neck are now very fat and I feel like I don't even look like myself. 

Can anyone help me connect dots here? Is this a normal pattern of weight gain? And does anyone have a history of how they broke the cycle of food/sugar addiction? I'm eating myself into an early grave and I just want to feel confident in myself again. I'm definitely at a low point.",1589000914.0

My Food Confession - From 242 to 185 to 305 in Two Years,19,gc4hjr,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/gc4hjr/my_food_confession_from_242_to_185_to_305_in_two/,5,"(A long, rambling post about my struggles with food addiction).

TL;DR below. 

-

I (20m) am writing this for two reasons: to vent my struggles and to motivate myself. 

I grew up in a pretty healthy family. Having a stay-at-home mom meant home-cooked meals every night and a healthy lunch for school. However, as I grew older (early teens) I found myself closet binging on whatever was in the house, usually salty snacks like crackers and chips. I was never a ""fat"" kid but I was always 20 or so pounds heavier than my friends in school. 

Enter my dad. While always very supportive and a role model to me, his fitness-nut mentalities and body builder physique led to severe self-image issues once I started noticing the way my body looked compared to others. Coupled with my struggles with my sexuality in my mid teens, the pressures to reshape myself more in my father's image lead to more and more closet eating (counterintuitive, I know) and a slow trend upward on the scale. By the time I was in my Junior year of high school (16) I weighed 242 at 6'1"". 

By that point I had enough of always thinking of myself as the fat guy and went on the HCG diet - a program my mom had lost 74 pounds on the year prior. It worked great for me, and by my senior year I was down to 185 pounds and felt great. However, my closet eating habits were still ocassionally giving me troubles, especially when I was stressed out. Then, right before I went to college in another state, I began dating my best friend, my parents divorced, a family member passed away, and I was sent to therapy for my bisexual tendencies. All of those issues compounded and manifested in me binging thousands of calories of junk food every night from my nightly grocery store runs wherein I would buy roughly $20-$30 of candy (filled licorice was my weakness), fried chicken, sandwiches, ice cream, pizza, and other assorted junk. I skyrocketed from 185 pounds in June of 2018 to 268 pounds in September (a gain of 80+ pounds in just 4 months). 

Since then I have been caught in a cycle of losing 10 or so pounds and keeping it off, only to slip and fall off the wagon and gain it all back and even pack more on. That cycle continued until I peaked in April of 2020 at 303.8 pounds. My blood pressure has increased, my hair has begun thinning, my overall health is in decline. My binging habits and addiction to food is leading me on a path to suicide by caloric intake. I have managed a few weeks free of all of my old binging foods and have managed to lose around 15 pounds and lower my blood pressure and resting heart rate marginally (I live with my GF (19F) who is a Medical Assistant and she helps me by keeping tabs on my vitals). 

I'm dreading the thought that this might just be another occurrence of the cycle I've been stuck in and I would love to hear from others struggling from food addictions as to what they do to keep their cravings and urges under control. I'm excited by the prospect of getting to relive that moment of seeing that scale read under 200 pounds for the first time and hopefully I will be there by this time next year.

Previously, I was eating fast food for 95% of my meals. I tried to stop a few times, but the cravings and withdrawal were too much. Now, I have not touched fast food since I started my recovery 12 days ago. That is the longest I have been without fast food in almost 10 years.
One thing that has helped me is I have started posting on instagram daily about how I am eating. Knowing that I have to post about any possible mistakes helped me avoid fast food because I don't want deal with the guilt (or the guilt of lying or not posting).
Also, notice how I didn't say that I was posting about ""my diet"". This isn't a diet. This is a life style change. I don't plan to come off of this change and eventually go back to the way I was eating. My main goal is not to lose weight (although that is something I would like), but to be healthier. For some reason, just knowing that this isn't just a temporary change to lose weight has somehow helped me keep my cravings down. 
I have accepted that I may never eat fast food again, but that there are other foods I can eat that taste good. Once I feel that I am ready to take the next step, I plan to slowly work more healthier foods into my meals.

An Intro! Hi everyone!,11,g51yzk,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/g51yzk/an_intro_hi_everyone/,1,"Hi! I'm new here and I'm trying to recover. 

*\[Might be triggering for people who struggle with EDs\]*

I've never had a normal relationship with food. As a small child, I did not like the taste or texture of food, found zero joy in eating, and found the whole thing a major inconvenience. Once puberty struck, it's like a flip switched and I started loving all types of food, even fruits and veggies. I slowly gained weight over the years and by my teens I was overeating regularly, and though I didn't know what ""binge eating"" was at the time, I was definitely having episodes of binging. 

As a young adult, I wanted to change and I lost weight so I was in a normal range and looked skinny. At the time, I thought I was healthy but looking back, it wasn't healthy at all. I literally had a treadmill next to my bed, I'd use it first thing in the morning, last thing at night. If I wanted to eat, I had to ""punish"" myself by working out both before and after eating. I didn't drive, so I would purposely sign up for 10+ hour shifts at work specifically so I would be stuck there all day and night without any access to get food and eat. After work, I'd go home and binge eat, and then fall asleep. That was a pretty regular routine. 

I am coming to the terms that I was also bulimic - it is hard to even type that out. I denied it for so long. I started doing this with the excuse that I would only do it when I had fast food, as a type of punishment - if I didn't want to vomit, then I'd stay away from fast food forever! But I'd still occasionally eat fast food, so I'd throw it up. It never became a regular routine or a daily thing, but it's something that I would do when I felt extra amounts of guilt and shame from overeating or binging. This behavior went on for a couple of years but of course it didn't last. The nature of this is unsustainable.

Thankfully, I realized that my behaviors were unhealthy. I figured that since I was at a good weight, it would be an easy transition (ha ha ha) to maintain in a healthy matter. I never realized at the time that I never had a normal relationship with food. Also everyone in my family is either obese or morbidly obese, so I had no framework on what a healthy relationship with food and fitness were. I went right back to overeating and binge eating. I always swore I would be different from my family, I wouldn't get to the point of obesity. This Spring, according to the BMI (which I am aware is not perfect and at times can be very flawed), I have crossed the obese threshold. That's where I am today. 

And I'm ready for change and do a lot of inner work.

Also, that 'Schema Therapy', which deals with these mindsets, could be useful for helping this group of people. The results of this study will be important to support the assessment of the schema modes of people with eating disorders, which could then help Schema Therapy to treat eating disorders.

She loves this program and swears up and down that it helps, she just let herself fall again. I want so badly to understand and be there for here. I tell her all the time she can always talk to me about anything. I know it's also harder for her because while she is addicted to food, sometimes a i hate food. i suffer from anxiety and tend to get nauseous when im stressed out which instantly kills my appetite. her and i both struggle a lot maintaining a healthy weight but in different ends of the spectrum. i'm also not suffering anywhere nearly as bad as her. Is there anything i can do specifically to help? i try to ask her all the time but she tells me she needs to do this by herself. i get that, but wouldn't keeping sweets, talking about weight not help? ive offered to get rid of my snacks, be there if she needs to vent, but she says that if she is gonna binge, having my snacks there wont make a difference. i just feel so helpless!!! i see her suffering and struggle and so desperately want understand her more and do something to help. she talks to her therapist and her (now new) sponsor about this stuff but that's it. Is this normal? i feel like i've found absolutely nothing helpful online no matter how many hours i surf the web. just repetition of the basics of what a food addiction is, that she should see a therapist, and family/friends need to be ""supportive.""

Over this past 8 years, I gained 120 lbs (currently 280 lbs) and my health has gone downhill. I have tried multiple times to lose weight and stop eating fast food, but now I realize that I need to focus solely on my addiction before I can even begin to try losing weight. 
Currently, I eat fast food for 95% of my meals. Tomorrow, I begin the first day of not eating out. Does anyone have any tips? I plan to start by eating all of my favorite non fast food meals until the cravings calm down a bit. 
And for those who have been on this journey a while, will I ever be able to eat fast food again? I have heard that it is a chemical dependency, and am worried that if I were to ever try to treat myself by going out, that I would revert back to my addiction.",1586641293.0

I had a meeting with my food addiction counsellor today and I woke to the fact that while I have been abstinent from flour and sugar for the past year in recent months I have been inconsistent with committing my food before eating it and eating only what I had committed to eat. This lying by omission has only caused a lot of unrest and tension Within Me. I got rigorously honest this afternoon by telling my other fellows who are experiencing food addiction what is going on with me and resetting my abstinence date. Fear and dishonesty and codependency are the trifecta of my disease. I am not going to let them win anymore. I accept my powerlessness over the food and food behaviours and am introducing additional structure into my recovery to safeguard against such slips moving forward.

Finally!,16,fy4mme,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fy4mme/finally/,3,"I feel like the clouds are parting.  Like the proverbial weight is lifting and soon, the physical weight will too.

So, a little background.  I'm 36, and have a BMI a little over 43.  In lamens terms, that's dangerously obese.  I can still walk, but very overweight and it effects  my health every day in increasingly dangerous ways.

I have been fighting a very unhealthy relationship with food since I was five.  FIVE.  I know it was this age, because that was the first time I remember feeling obsessed with food - I was put on a diet to lose my 'baby fat' for the pageant circuit (seriously, eff those things.)

I have studied nutrition in nursing school.  I know healthy eating.  I know how to exercise and burn calories.  My problem wasn't lack of knowledge.   I wish I could say it was a medical issue, a part of me wishes I could say that I tried and tried but nothing would take the weight off.  The problem was flat out food addiction.  I could write a book about this struggle (after all, it's been 30+ years,) however I won't. I'm sure you've read lots of stories and have your own.

A couple months ago someone talked to me - someone that dealt with anorexia/bulimia.  This may sound stupid, but it was a strangely healing experience.  Idk, I was internally insecure, I had this thought that she would be so grossed out and disgusted by me as a fat person.  I saw myself as the thing that she had once nearly died to avoid becoming. But she was really understanding and totally connected with how exhausted I was with this constant fight with food.  She said that our food obsessions had different symptoms but was a similar disease in some ways.  It made me see clearly that I can't allow myself to feel ashamed for needing outside help in combating this.

Most importantly, she told me to not just get help - to get as MUCH HELP AS I CAN.  Don't just look for a single accountability buddy, or read a book, or watch a youtube channel.  Join a class, get some therapy, and TALK TO A DOCTOR a out possible medical help.   

 SERIOUSLY.

There is so little talk about this, I have mentioned help to every doctor I have ever had in the last 15 years but was too nervous to directly ask what options were out there.  Evwry doctor has told me ""it's just a out willpower.""  I THOUGHT I KNEW.  I thought the only options for medical help was some sort of dangerous stimulant (which I didn't need), appetite suppressant (which doesn't help if you eat compulsively), or surgery (which is also not a magical fix and is kind of the nuclear option, imo).

Enter my newest doctor that I met a couple weeks ago.  I got established with him, and said my main concern was weight loss and getting my blood sugar consistently in a healthy place.  I was upfront about being in therapy for food addiction and compulsive eating.  And this doctor did the unthinkable and started asking questions and started LISTING OUT OPTIONS in medicines we could try to help.  And holy crap, when I said appetite suppressants were useless because I ate compulsively and I was trying to stop, HE HEARD ME.

So he prescribed me Topimax.   I'm on day 6.  Tomorrow I start taking it 2x a day.  But holy crap.  Things are changing.

I still enjoy food.  But I don't have the same emotional attachment to food.  I don't feel loss or agitation if I choose to not eat something.  

I can recognize satiation, and stop eating, rather than eat until I start feeling uncomfortable. 

I choose healthy options way more easily and can walk away from sugar until I feel it appropriate.  I baked a big freaking cake on day 2, and there's still a 3rd of it left (my husband has a piece or so a day).  

My senses of smell and taste are... maybe intensifying is the wrong word... coming back?  I had to go to the store yesterday and could smell the toothpaste when we walked by the isle for it.  I'm starting to reject a lot more foods because I notice certain flavors are either off or too intense (I may never eat McDonald's again bc of the salt).

I don't know how long this medication will help like this, but I will use this as best as I can during this time, continuing with therapy, diet, exercise, and education. 

I know that's a lot of text.  TLDR is to please get as much help as you can.  U.S. peeps with little to no Insurance, call dept or health, churches, doctors offices, everywhere to see what is available for reduced prices or free.

I got a job in the beginning of March. Went out and celebrated with friends after trying to abstain for sugar for lent (not even religious but it was a good excuse). Gave in to peer pressure. My friends friend is a food enabler and I hate hanging out with them together. Ever since then I went back to my old eating habits. And my vice is ARTIFICIAL SUGAR. I literally have the worst sweet tooth and I know it‚Äôs killing me. My old eating habits consist of constantly eating. I know how to eat so much food and not feel full. Probably because my body was always used to being in starvation mode and now it‚Äôs trying to fatten itself up and not die. I have constant desire for the instant gratification for fast food when I know it‚Äôs horrible for me and it never EVER tastes as good as home made. I eat everything on my plate no matter how much is on and I constantly go for seconds and thirds. Constantly thinking about something new and tasty to snack on.

So what‚Äôs the point? Why should I get skinny if I‚Äôll always look ugly? I‚Äôm trying to do it for a health standpoint. I want to be healthy and live well and I know fasting is the way to do it.

Weight Regain and Past Addiction to Coca Cola,11,fwq2n0,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fwq2n0/weight_regain_and_past_addiction_to_coca_cola/,7,"Hi everyone,

For the last two months, I have hit a major plateau and have struggled to lose any weight.

Due to global circumstances and me losing momentum, I have been steadily rediscovering my old eating habits and binge eating behaviours, and I have somehow let them back in, falling back to how I used to be.

Food cravings have emerged and are really intense. For a while I was able to hold them at bay, but anything that is sweet, sugary, salty and delicious keeps calling out my name and I find myself giving in every time. I would feel so bloated, stuffed and gross afterwards, yet I myself going back again, creating a perpetual painful addiction cycle!

I have been gained about 4kgs in the last three weeks which disappoints me as I just managed to fit into my old bathing suit, now I am back to being too big to wear them!

I want to wrestle back the momentum, however with the pandemic and several key resources being closed off, it would be much more difficult and I don‚Äôt have as much freedom for food availability.

For a while, I have restricted myself from drinking Coca Cola, and have not had a sip at all for over 600 days. However with limited food freedom and changes to budget, it will be hard to keep this up, and I may inevitably give in at some point.

I now find myself asking what would be more important and beneficial to me? My mind keeps going left and right?

A: Going cold turkey?
- More beneficial to health
- Maintain streak
- Possible growth of anxiety and unhappiness over restriction and control

B: Letting the walls down and allow myself a drink in hope of having things under balance, which benefits lower anxiety and increased happiness?

- Lower anxiety over less rules to stick with
- Happiness of my settler achievements
- Increased likelihood of more weight gain
- Increased responsibility to prevent addiction
- With moderation, minimal impact to health",1586285102.0

My main motivation to eat healthily is to maintain a low weight for rock climbing, my current greatest passion. As awful as it is, a part of me wants to use the quarantine as an opportunity to stop working out and get fat, so that when the quarantine ends, I'll want to quit rock climbing. Then I can finally be free of the one thing that's preventing me from embracing a life of food and overeating. How can I be so addicted to food that I would throw my greatest passion and all of the hard work I've put into training during the past year?

Also, that 'Schema Therapy', which deals with these mindsets, could be useful for helping this group of people. The results of this study will be important to support the assessment of the schema modes of people with eating disorders, which could then help Schema Therapy to treat eating disorders.

"I Feel Lost, Any Advice Would Help",12,fqcc29,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fqcc29/i_feel_lost_any_advice_would_help/,9,"Hey, this is my first post on Reddit ever, but I've been a longtime lurker of this sub. If my formatting or anything is incorrect please let me know and I'll try and fix it. By the way, this post might be a little lengthy, so I'll be sure to include a TL;DR at the end. Anyways, I'm a college freshman, 18F. I've never been overly heavy for my height, however, I've always been a little chubby. For reference, I'm 5'6 and before I came to college I weighed around 165 lbs. 

I've always had problems with controlling my eating. Throughout middle school and high school, I'd eat breakfast almost every morning, when I got to school, I'd buy lunch, and when I got home, I'd have a large snack that usually consisted of two or three bags of snack-sized Doritos, four or five girl scout cookies, and a small stack of Ritz crackers. After this, I'd usually make myself a small wrap or heat up some soup in the microwave. This was a daily ritual for me, one that I couldn't seem to shake. I'm sure that the only reason I wasn't heavier than 165 lbs was because I played multiple sports through out the year. However, I always found myself feeling uncomfortable with my body and with the amount of food I was eating. No matter how hard I tried to eat a normal, healthy amount, it's like I'd become naturally drawn to the pantry, the fridge, the microwave, etc. 

A change came when I left home for college. Within just the first semester, I lost about fifteen pounds. This was not only the result of implementing a weekly workout schedule, but I found that with being at college, I ate a lot less than I would at home. I felt as though I finally had real control of my eating and portions for the first time in years. However, upon returning home for fall break, I found that I fell back into my old tendencies, hard. There was always an excuse for eating the massive portions I ate, one reoccurring one was, ""it's Thanksgiving break, this is okay, I'll just control my eating at school"". With this, I'd consume towering-portions, multiple desserts, and snacks throughout the day. Afterwards, I'd always feel stuffed, and utterly guilty. 

When I returned to school, my I got my eating under control once again, and got to my lowest weight of 140 lbs. The fact that I could control the foods I had direct access to helped a lot. What I found though is that every time I'd go home, I'd eat as if every meal was my last. This was especially true during winter break. Upon returning to school for spring semester, I found that I'd gained 10 pounds over winter break, and I was back at 150 lbs. This time, my eating pattern didn't fall back into normalcy as it did upon first coming to campus, or returning to campus after fall break. This time, I consumed all the snacks and sweets in my room within a few hours. I even ate half a jar of Welch's Grape Jelly over the course of a day. Almost anytime I got money, I'd spend it on food. I'd buy a pizza, and eat the whole thing within an hour of receiving it, despite having felt full after my second or third slice. My eating had gotten as bad as it was previously, if not, worse. 

Now, I'm home for the rest of the semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since I've been home, my eating has been more out-of-control than ever. At all hours of the day, I'm eating *something*. I've read countless books and articles regarding food addiction, about trying to ride out your urges, but I feel like I just can't. I couldn't even tell you what thoughts go through my mind when I start craving a food. It feels as though I just visualize a food, and my legs bring me to the pantry. And, within moments, I'm uncomfortably full and entirely disappointed in myself. 

My weight just keeps climbing up, and currently, I weigh about 167 lbs, my highest weight yet. I feel as though I can't stop myself, especially when I see food around me and within reach. I don't want to keep doing this, I don't want to get any heavier, I don't want to keep feeling out of control. If anyone has any specific tips or recommendations, I'd really appreciate it. 

TL;DR - I'm a long-time food addict and with being home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been consistently gaining weight, and eating more uncontrollably than ever. Overall, I was just looking for any tips or recommendations to help me try and conquer my food addiction.",1585365673.0

I am so lost. Having no more physical structure is horrible.

Before this, I was going to the gym and getting better at eating. But even before corona started, I started relapsing a bit. I started eating more and going to the gym less. 

Now, with all classes going to online, I stopped taking college seriously because it's very hard to when you wake up to join the lecture call just for attendance and immediately fall back asleep, and have midterms you can obviously cheat on. My parents are fighting more because we're all stuck inside and are making less money. All I do is eat to cope. 

I keep trying to tell myself, whether it's true or not, that I should ration food as who knows how much longer this will all last. It doesn't work. I don't care. I just want to keep eating and eating, almost to the point of passing out, contributing to my already lack of motivation to do any college work. I even bought adderall before full quarantine to try to lose weight during this isolation, knowing ill gain weight other wise. Well taking only 5mgs a day isn't enough to keep the appetite away. I won't even have a physical desire to eat, it's all mental. How do I cope with this.

For some extra details, I live with my parents, and I have Russian parents, meaning they are all for buying a lot of food and just in general in our culture it's normalized to eat a lot and therefore always have a shit ton of food at home. I can't just ask my parents to buy less food because I have been saying that for years and, well, they need food for themselves too don't they? I am sitting here full beyond belief, too full to get myself to go do my assignment. I try to go out to exercise as I have a nice running park by my house but I can't do it. I've been going outside to see some friends at least twice a week but I can't get myself to go outside to work out. 

I don't want my boyfriend to come to my house after quarantine is over and be greeted by a heavier me. How do I gain control and lose weight in this situation?
Finally for some more detail Incase it's needed; 19 year old 155 pound female 5'4"", with some of that weight being muscle mass from when I hit the gym regularly, have been overweight to just a point of ""chubby"" my entire life. My heaviest was 160 at 13 years old. I don't know how I slimmed down from that. I was 140 ish 8th grade to almost all of high school and then gained weight back in college. 

If I can't lose weight during this time, I need to at least make sure to put it off. I thought this quarantine would be the perfect time to lose weight as most of my calories prior came from eating out with my boyfriend and friends and having to eat college cafeteria food, but now it's just turned into eating my entire fridge without even enjoying doing so. I even went back to vaping to try to lose weight. My friend on the wrestling team back in high school had to lose 10 pounds for the tournament, and when I asked her how she stopped eating, she said ""a lot of nicotine."" So I thought it'd try it. It didn't work and either way why would I go back to a bad habit to try to lose weight when it doesn't even work. I just don't know what to do anymore.",1585195236.0

The pain/addiction positive feedback loop,7,fjietp,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fjietp/the_painaddiction_positive_feedback_loop/,1,"Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis started showing up for me 2 months before I turned 18. I was a track athlete, and coming down really hard on the balls of my feet all the time. My feet became very swollen. I will turn 22 in approximately 2 months, and my feet are only worse. I usually cannot spend more than, say, an hour a day on my feet. There have been brief periods of remission, but ultimately I've not been able to experience lasting relief with medicine alone.

I was diagnosed a year after symptoms showed up. Immediately, it became clear that my diet had to change. And I have read (or rather, skimmed) so many books, and watched so many interviews, and paid what feels like *such* close attention to the potential ways of eating that seem appropriate for someone in my condition. **But I haven't changed a thing about my diet**. I *have* been trying, you know? I'll make a meal plan and try to carry it out for a week, in hopes for trying something out for at least a month. But I'm just too fucking addicted to processed food. As soon as I get anxious I want it (and I get *very* anxious *very* often).

I guess I'm posting this because at this point my illness and my addiction seem inextricably linked. Many of the folks in the arthritis/PsA/chronic pain subs either don't see that it's addiction that's playing a hand in their pain or aren't addicted, and are thus able to just fix it.

I feel like such a pussy. All the time. Because I *know* I'm capable of getting through this and overcoming this, because I *have* to be. But damn it, I don't think I can do it by myself. I need help. Not from talk therapy, I need ***help***. I need to **STOP**. I'm scared of what happens if I don't.

Self-Treatment so far..,12,fhngay,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fhngay/selftreatment_so_far/,2,"I've been in this group for a while and have found some inspiring threads over time. I'll like to explain my upbringing and some tips I have found to help me.
I've looked to food as a crutch since childhood (due to trauma, parents divorcing, and depression that started when I was about 10). Over the course of the year 2000 you could see my weight increase as I turned to food for happiness and the release of endorphins. I would steal food from cabinets, money from my father's wallet to buy food from the corner store, and make random food experiments in hopes to satisfy my enraged hunger for more. This type of behavior continued almost daily until 2017 when I was pregnant with my daughter. I made it my goal to be the perfect pregnant woman and eating the most heathly as humanly possible - and I was successful. Eating whole foods plant based with Quinoa and Rice. I'm pretty sure eating this way saved my pregnancy from any problems I could have developed (preeclampsia, prenatal diabetes etc.).
After birth, however, things took a turn. With postpartum depression, the lack of ability to breastfeed, and a child that if left on her back would choke and almost die without constant attention. These events led to a deep abyss of self doubt and feeling a lack of control over.. anything.
I continued eating a while foods diet until about a month after birth where my child WOULD NOT SLEEP - this led to late night/early morning drive in a car to get her to sleep. Jack in the box is open 24/7.. and they just launched their Munchie meals for discount until 5am - I would have one whole box each morning at 3 am after my daughter fell asleep in the car. This was only pre-breakfast to my day. I felt disgusting after I would eat the whole box - sick, greasy, and this habit is not cheap when added up in a month.
My portion sizes became MASSIVE (thankfully I did a moderate about of walking and cleaning to never reach over 250 lbs). Eating cups of cooked rice a day, pizza, bread and any other carb you can think of. I do have a dairy intolerance, after my pregnancy I became intolerant to gluten, and I cannot have high amounts of sodium due to swelling. One could say I am blessed as these things have really pushed me in a better direction - most would view this as a curse as my diet is now very limited. 

What has helped me so far (as there are still some refining to do):
1. Document! In a journal write down what you ate and how it made you feel. Does eating boxed Mac&cheese (what was my kryptonite - not anymore) make you feel bloated? Do you feel satiated? Could you really taste the layers of cheese flavored powder? Having food addiction and consuming can become a mindless activity - but making the time to write these things down can really bring you back to the moment and helps with future decisions.
2. Savings! Eating out is EXPENSIVE and not always healthy nor hygienic. It is easy to add a lot more items to your meal eating out than it is to eat in. Take a look at your finances and how much you are really spending on each item in a week. Swiping a card and eating the contents of a bag to fill the void of the present - is easy. So to save that money - when I think about wanting two crunch wrap Supremes and a breakfast crunch wrap from Taco Bell and knowing I have food at home - pull into the parking lot and whip out that Mobil banking app and depositing that money I would spend into my savings. By doing this I've made an investment in my future, and the money would have been pulled out of the checking account anyway. I honestly feel a lot more satisfaction doing this simple act, then waiting in the driveway and binging on 2500 calories.
3. New Favorites! Don't be afraid to try vegetables. I still eat about the same in terms of plate portions as I did while in my haze - but I have replaced everything on my plate with fiber, good fats, water, and proteins. I eat cups of broccoli, potatoes, avocado, mushrooms, spinach tomatoes, apples and more in a day. By finding these new Favorites and using them in my daily plans I can eat large amounts and never go over my 1800 calorie limit in a day. Now, I understand eating these new foods are not really fun in the beginning - but experiment and have fun with it. There are YouTube videos that show you how to prepare a single egg 63 different ways! Pick out seasonings that you really want and soon you'll begin to crave an avocado with seasoning salt or whatever your new favorite becomes. 
4. Plan! Colored construction paper, sharpie and tape/tacks (all from the dollar store) and write down a food plan. What the total calories are for each meal and what is in each meal. Be general here and just list the basic ingredients you would want to each time of day - this way you can make each meal to how you are feeling in that moment. Make the ingredients into a soup, roast them, saut√© etc. Don't have the time to make each individual meal? Meal prep - there are thousands of recipes and resources on the internet and you don't have to go with the extremes. Make the plan to how YOU want it - and tape it on your fridge.
5. Refine! As with all things natural in the world - it takes time. Crawling out of the addiction will not be easy and you will learn a lot of things about yourself along the way - triggers, determination, spirit - and you CAN do it. If you slip, get up and keep moving. Don't have the guilt weighing on your shoulders for having that pizza - be real and admit that pizza was damn good - and move on. As we are always growing as people and learning so much more each day, if something in your plan is not working - refine it. Makes those adjustments, add some more fiber and fat into breakfast. Drink some more water (Crystal light if you prefer). It's okay to change something if it's not working.
6. Research! Food science! Learning is so much fun! Learn about how food is broken down into our bodies, nutrition is moved from point A to point B and how the brain sees food. How our body works is not often tought in schools nor does a doctor tell how insulin is used in the body ( it opens the  gateway for nutrition to enter vital organs). The more action you take into furthering your knowledge the better you help yourself in the future. Make that investment in yourself for when you retire and want to run outside. That investment for your kids and grandkids. That investment in not needing assistance at an old age because you new how to take care of yourself enough to keep moving forward.

I hope this post inspires someone, as so many others have inspired me to take action. Wish you all the best in your journeys!",1584046565.0
Day in the life of what I‚Äôll call ‚Äúproblem eating‚Äù,17,fgrxqq,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fgrxqq/day_in_the_life_of_what_ill_call_problem_eating/,8,"I don‚Äôt know if this is food addiction, but I‚Äôm so frustrated with how I eat. I‚Äôve gained so much weight and dieting feels like death to me. I‚Äôm out of control. I just need to vent..

I feel like food and alcohol are all I think about anymore. From the moment I wake up, I‚Äôm thinking about what I‚Äôll eat that day, planning everything out. For breakfast, two giant bowls of cinnamon life cereal with a shit ton of blueberries and full fat milk and a nice cold can or two of soda to wash it down, all before I need to leave for work. And since I sleep in so late everyday, I have about five minutes to scarf it down, which I do easily. 

I NEVER eat slowly. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm always the first to finish my plate and now I prefer to eat alone. Between 8:30 and 10:30 am at work I‚Äôll have yogurt, fruit, some type of breakfast bar, maybe some hot Cheetos and whatever donuts or sweets someone brought in. Usually there‚Äôs leftovers so I‚Äôll have another donut. I also have a couple cups of coffee and another soda. 

Ok now it‚Äôs about 11 am..and I feel STARVING for lunch. It‚Äôll probably be fast food where I‚Äôll order large sized French fries and a soda in addition to a burger or burrito. I eat all this in my car in less than 10 minutes (only get 30 for lunch and I‚Äôm WAY too embarrassed for everyone to see what I eat and don‚Äôt even bring the trash inside, I just leave it all in my car and throw it away at a gas station later). 

Everyone else at work skips breakfast and has a cute little salad for lunch. ‚ÄúHow are these people not keeling over?‚Äù I wonder. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they fucking hungry?‚Äù If I try to eat like that, I get the worst anxiety. I shake, I can‚Äôt talk, I can‚Äôt think. I feel short of breath, light-headed, irritable, like I‚Äôm going to faint. I‚Äôve had fasting blood tests (which I barely manage to get through) to screen for blood sugar problems and thyroid and everything else under the sun but they always come back normal. I can‚Äôt just NOT eat for two or more hours and it‚Äôs hard for me to imagine how easily everyone else seems to do it. When people say they ‚Äúforgot to eat lunch‚Äù I want to slap them.

Usually I have more fruit and some crackers and a yogurt then more soda in the afternoon. A lot of the food I eat might be considered healthy but it‚Äôs the quantity and frequency I eat that feels so out of control to me. Plus my drinking doesn‚Äôt help at all.

As soon as I get home, I crack a 16 oz. IPA to drink while I cook dinner. I get drunk really easily, like 2 beers gives me a hangover, even though I drink everyday. So I‚Äôll get kind of drunk while cooking pasta or tacos or a fat juicy steak with loaded mashed potatoes or if I get too drunk too fast, I order pizza. I can‚Äôt just not have my two or three beers per night. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic (or maybe I do qualify idk, I just know the crippling_alcoholism sub would laugh me out of the room) but I seriously can‚Äôt not have my beers. I‚Äôm a fidgety, anxious, irritable mess without them, but I‚Äôm also anxious when I drink because a hangover at work is just about the worst hell I can imagine, so I eat a lot to make up for how drunk I am. If we get pizza, my husband and I order our own medium sized pizzas and finish them off. I have to get rid of the drunk somehow because my hangovers are horrendous even if it‚Äôs only from two beers. Then I need my sweets. So I‚Äôll have 18 or so Hi-Chews plus ice cream if we have it. Lately it‚Äôs been Girl Scout Cookies and ill eat about half a box in addition to my other treats. Finally I go to bed, hating myself for all the bullshit I ate that day and wondering why all I ever think about is food and booze. 


If I didn‚Äôt have my food or alcohol to lean on, I feel like I‚Äôd explode into a million little pieces. I remember what life felt like when I wasn‚Äôt like this, when food didn‚Äôt consume all my thoughts and I was one of those people who would forget to eat. When I weighed a normal, healthy weight and wasn‚Äôt disgusted by my huge out of control body. I don‚Äôt know what happened and I just want to go back to how things used to be.",1583903106.0

I basically barely eat anything and then get angry and my brain just doesn't realise that I haven't eaten. And when I do get something to eat I just take a few bites and put the rest back. I usually need to finish the whole plate/whole box/whole bag.

There is no escape from a lifetime of food addiction for me.,23,fdrfe8,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fdrfe8/there_is_no_escape_from_a_lifetime_of_food/,20,"I've always liked food more than anyone I know in real life. I've always been more excited about food than anyone I know in real life. I've always ate 2-5x as fast as anyone I know in real life.

When I come home from the grocery store with bags full of all my favorite foods, it feels like Christmas morning.

When I sit down in front of the TV with a large pizza, a family size bag of chips, and 1.5 quarts of ice cream, I am squealing with delight on the inside.

When I walk into the buffet, I'm like a kid walking into chuck e cheese.

I remember once in the 1st or 2nd grade eating seven dinner plate-sized pancakes for breakfast like it was nothing. In middle school, I would regularly put down 6 tacos and a pound of potato oles from taco john's for dinner. In high school, whenever I went to my mom's for the weekend, I would go through 1-2 containers of ice cream, 2+ bags of chips, and 1-2 packages of cookies. During my freshman year of college, when I went to the dining hall, I'd get 2-3 plates of food so that I could obtain a sizeable portion of every food item that seemed tasty, and at the end of each meal I'd get one of every dessert. I'd also walk out with additional desserts in my hands. During my junior year and senior year of college, my eating got really out of control. There were days in those two years in which I had breakfast from McDonald's, two pizzas from Little Caesar's, a box of pastries, a family size bag of chips, and 1.5 quarts of ice cream.

Because of years and years of eating unhealthy food in copious amounts, I am wholly unsatisfied eating <= TDEE. It doesn't matter how much protein, veggies, and fruit I load up on, I still want to eat my weight in sugar, and no, throwing in 1 donut or 1 slice of pizza doesn't help, it just makes things worse. The only way I can keep my calories in check and maintain a healthy weight is through sheer willpower, but I can only sustain that for so long. How can I turn down opportunity after opportunity for instant joy and euphoria day after day after day? Is being skinny really worth the constant self-denial, constant battles, and perpetual torment? People say eating healthy gets easier over time‚ÄîI doubt that's the case for me. Eating 12 donuts will always seem like a ticket straight to heaven.

Sometimes I think it would be better to let go and just accept becoming obese so that I can eat whatever I want whenever I want without a care in the world. If I only I didn't care about rock climbing. If I only I didn't care about my appearance. If only I didn't care about being physically attractive to the opposite sex.

I did manage to lose 24 lbs recently for the sake of rock climbing by eating 700-1000 calories under TDEE for months, but I developed binge eating disorder because I missed eating two pizzas in one sitting too much. And fwiw, my stomach did not shrink at all during this period. I was able to eat 70 chicken nuggets in under 30 minutes as part of a challenge after losing all that weight, and after eating those nuggets I made more food for myself to eat...",1583391171.0

I didn‚Äôt always have low self esteem, it was a process of bad experiences that lead to it. Primary school wasn‚Äôt great. I was bullied sort off. I guess I was left out a lot.

I was back on a repetitive cycle again, I gained even more weight. A few months later I‚Äôd go on a diet again, sabotage myself and give up, then go on a diet again, then sabotage myself and give up. Another repetitive cycle that just went on and on. My self esteem kept deteriorating as time went on, I felt hopeless, like nothing could change. I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm ashamed of my body completely. Where every time I‚Äôm near a reflection I dread looking at myself. I can‚Äôt even wear my hair up cause I‚Äôve completely convinced myself that I look fatter with my hair tied up. Things where pretty shit. I then finally told my parents. I need to see someone. The physiologist was nice. But she really didn‚Äôt help. I still felt hopeless. My sister told me I relied on food for confort. That‚Äôs probably why I always binged. if anything goes wrong in a diet or during a diet I‚Äôd go searching for that comfort. She might be right. Currently I‚Äôve been on a plan. A diet plan that‚Äôs very expensive for my parents, I didn‚Äôt force them to put me on the plan. But never the less I feel guilty everyday because of the cost. It‚Äôs been almost 5 weeks. And today I ruined it by eating chocolate I found in the wardrobe. I have no self control. I keep doing this to myself. I keep hurting myself. I have this crippling low self esteem and yet while I‚Äôm on the process of getting better I make it worse. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I thought about it being a food addiction but honestly I don‚Äôt really know. I can‚Äôt stop myself. Things only get worse.

I feel like I have a new life!,7,fcaqbc,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/fcaqbc/i_feel_like_i_have_a_new_life/,2,"I wanted to share my thoughts and write them down.

Last week, I realised I had a food addiction. I was watching 'My 600LB Life - Where are they now' and during one episode, one of the participants on the show said something which was like a light from the heavens suddenly shone on me. It it was a total epiphany - for the first time, I realised I had a food addiction. 

Since I realised this, my life has totally changed. 

My bad habits and poor relationship with food has been going on my whole life. My family had/has extremely bad eating habits which I am realising the more I research into food addiction. For example:

* Massive portions - the big plates always have to be full of food
* Always eating desert after dinner 
* 'Enough' being when you are stuffed 
* Attaching food to emotions - eat junk when something good or bad happens
* Food being the only time my family socialises
* 99% of the time eating at all-you-can-eat buffets
* Unhealthy snacks every Friday/Saturday night
* Mostly frozen/pre-packaged foods

You know that feeling when you hear bad news? It was like that when I realised I had an addiction. 

I felt disgusted, angry, sick, disappointed, shocked,.... (the list goes on) in myself. I can't believe I never taught myself about food (I say this as someone who loves learning and strives for opportunities to learn more).

I've read lots of stories of overweight people 'having a moment' where it just hits them that they have a problem. Like running into a brick wall. I never thought this wound happen to me - but it did. And as soon as that realisation hit me, I spent most of the day at work researching about food addiction. 

I started self-counselling myself on my eating type, my triggers, my bad habits, my good habits, etc.

I realised I am about 80% habitual eater, 10% external eater, 10% emotional eater:

* Habitual - Eating set things at set times and having an expectation of what I will eat
* Habitual - Easily being derailed from eating habits by events (coming home late from work, stress, etc.)
* Habitual - Eating when not hungry because my internal schedule says it's time to eat
* External - Sometimes being tempted to get food if I know I can do so easily - such as a cake in the office, craving a fizzy drink and nipping to the corner shop two minutes walk away. But, I only do this for foods I'm craving, i.e. I wont see an advert on TV for Oreos and immediately want to eat some, even though I don't mind them.
* Emotional - I often eat junk food if I feel sad/sulky, or want to celebrate. But, this is usually controlled i.e. I don't usually gorge and eat a whole tub of Ben and Jerry's, I'll have a scoop or two

In the past, I have tried things like only eating when I am hungry, but I couldn't keep it up for more than a few days; something always made me slip up. Nothing seemed to be able to defeat how my brain was hardwired. But my epiphany was like someone ripped out all the wires and put them back in the correct way.

For the first time in my life, I feel like I have control over my food and my eating habits. Today at work, for the first time ever in my professional life, I didn't pay attention to the clock to see when if it was time I could eat. I am able to overcome cravings driven by my old eating types. 

I have considered myself to be on a weight loss journey for a long time. At one point I lost a lot of weight with extreme exercise, but I gained it back once I could no longer keep up the workouts. But now I see a light at the end of the tunnel with my weight loss journey for the first time in my life. One day I can quit being on a journey. The train will arrive at it's final destination of internal peace with food and I will never suffer through stuff like calorie counting again.",1583148560.0

I don't overeat for 3 days, I feel really proud of myself, I tackle every craving and hold strong, i'm convinced that this is it, this is the time it will work, and then... I run out of rice cakes when I'm not expecting to, so I think... well... peanut butter on toast is ok. There's no butter. Husband's left over chips, still warm, sit on the side. I try to replan, something for dinner, something for dinner. 

Then it happens.

... You could just eat the chips. You could eat the chips and then eat that bag of mini eggs with a cup of tea. You could eat literally whatever you want.  You could order takeaway.

Currently 20 hours sober from bingeing. Anyway, what I want to talk about is how relaxed binge eating, and nothing else, makes me feel. I lost over 30lbs a couple of years ago, but ended up putting it all back on, and the reason is: I lost the weight during a period I wasn't at work, I was relaxed all the time, and if there was a time I wasn't, I had plenty of time to get relaxed. Then I went back to work, and after 10 hours of stressful work, with only 3 hours before I had to go to sleep... bingeing creates instant relaxation. If there's a chance i'll run out of food before I feel completely sick, then its not relaxing, its gotta be 4 peoples worth of food or nothing.

Today I realised I'm addicted to food,7,f9vc1n,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/f9vc1n/today_i_realised_im_addicted_to_food/,0,"Like the title says; today I realised I'm addicted to food. I just had this total epiphany. I did some googling and realised it was definitely a thing for me. I wanted to write and get my thoughts out and at the same time analyse my problems, think about them, and think of ways to overcome my addiction.

I've been watching a lot of my 600lb life recently (I work in a office and have it on in the background whilst working). Despite watching so much of this show it never hit me I was exactly like them. Until today. One of the participants on the show said something and it resonated with me totally, and I realised I was an addict.

I'm a little overweight; not 'big' but I definitely have an addiction.

My problem areas:

* Snacking during work - I can't stop thinking about snacks or eating. My job is really, really boring and sedentary but I can't leave it at the moment for various reasons which I won't get into now. So the most exciting and interesting part of my day is eating. I'm trying to change that. I started only snacking on only plain rice cakes in the past few weeks, and watching TV shows in the background to distract me (like My 600lb Life).
* Dinnertime - I can eat pretty well during the day but I dinnertime is ALWAYS my weak point. And I'm extra screwed if I don't eat so well during the day because I will still have a bad dinner. It's my most calorific meal by far. I'm okay at keeping snacks/breakfast/lunch under 300kcals but everything goes downhill at dinner. Even if the dinner is pretty low-cal, I end up having lots of desert, or snacking during the evening because I'm like ""I had a small/ low-cal dinner"".
* Weekends - I don't take care of my diet at the weekends at all. Often my priority will be convenience over health because I want to have fun, not cook (not that I hate cooking, but there are more fun things to do). I will eat mostly stuff like breads, and fries. Sometimes I cook a healthy Sunday lunch (boiled carrots/parsnips/sprouts/peas/potatoes and some plain vegetarian meat substitute all covered in onion gravy) but even when I do this I stuff myself crazy, so still end up consuming more calories than I should and I don't even know why. This happens every single time I make a roast dinner. I think its because I'm like ""oh it's mostly plain veg so it won't be super filling"" but then it is.
* Stress being a trigger, but then an excuse. If I'm super stressed I might make mac and cheese or a pizza. But then I keep doing that, rather than snapping back into a healthy rhythm after one unhealthy meal.
* I eat really fast. My family were all fast eaters, and my best friend is too, so I never really notice it. To eat slow I have to literally focus all my energy into it because my mind wanders a lot, and when it wanders I forget to eat slow and I look down and my food is gone.
* Getting my mind stuck on what I want to eat. For example after dinner, I might think about eating cake or a chocolate bar. Then I can't stop thinking about it until I eat it. If the food isn't in the house it's a lot easier to stop thinking about the craving.
* I see others snacking so think it's okay for me to snack.

My good areas:

* I cut out sugar from my hot drinks about 6 months ago.
* I eat plain bran flakes for weekday breakfast (no milk).
* I only snack on rice cakes during work and am going to start doing this during home-time too.
* I only home cook food. I banned myself from takeouts this year and still keeping it up, and I've also banned myself from ready made stuff (ready meals, cookies, cake, frozen pizza, etc.). If I want cake, I have to bake it. If I want pizza I have to make the dough myself and use fresh ingredients. You get the idea.
* I can restrict myself. E.g. if I'm craving some chocolate, I will eat a few squares rather than a huge family sized bar. 
* I can have junk lying around in my house and I can avoid it. As I said above, I often get my mind stuck on foods I want to eat. So unless my mind is stuck on a particular food I can avoid it.
* Generally, if I don't have something in the house, I won't eat it. If I'm REALLY craving it, I will walk (never drive) to the store to buy it.
* I'm getting better at saying no to myself. For example last night I thought about having some tea and biscuits. But I was like no girl it's 10PM you don't need sugary biscuits before bed. Just have a plain tea and call it.

What I want to change

* Drink more water.
* Eat my meals more slowly.
* Not buy junk food or unhealthy snacks.
* Meal plan better for the weekend and find healthier alternatives to the food I like.
* Understanding that you shouldn't feel full after every meal - feeling really full should be the exception, not the rule.
* Not snacking before dinner.
* Finding some quick, easy and tasty meals to cook at the weekend when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to cook.
* If I'm craving a veggie sausage sandwich, just have the sausages plain instead of making them into a sandwich.
* Don't bake so much!",1582732756.0

I think I am addicted to food,8,f9pr0v,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/f9pr0v/i_think_i_am_addicted_to_food/,0,"My family is trying to transition to the keto diet, but that plan was tarnished from the start. My brother doesn't want or need a diet, and he's too lazy to ever make something for himself so my parents buy him a box of sugary cereal bars every day.

My dad has spent our entire lives trying to make up for emotional coldness and parental abandonement with food. 3 times a week he buys a whole sack of junk food. For 2 weeks I managed to talk him into only doing it once a week on our cheat day. But then my mum became paranoid about Coronavirus and people emptying stores, so she's stocking up food and my dad took it as permission to forego the diet.

I can totally resist takeaways and cafes and eating out, but I absolutely cannot ignore what's in the cubboards at home. And now, as I'm trying to do an effort to be healthy with 0 help from anyone, I'm realising just how bad my food addiction is. I'm at a normal weight, but I'm skinny-fat, extremely out of shape and most likely insulin-resistant, which is scary because diabetes runs in my family.

I get food cravings all the time. In the morning I always crave something sweet, besides the times during the rest of the day. It astounds me how I just get a specific craving for everything including cheese, fruit, bread, pastries, fish, pickles. And I actually end up eating more if I haven't satisfied that craving. And because the keto diet involves avoiding processed carbs, I just end up eating more to deal with the lack of bread.

My worst behaviour of food addiction however is when I go to my grandma. She has cubboards absolutely filled with junk, besides the good meals she makes. And whenever I visit I always end up overeating to the point where the next day I have indigestion. I seriously don't know why my instincts just tell me to gorge as much as possible at her place. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm nervous around her and never liked her, and need my hands to fidget with something, and it's more socially acceptable to use them for cutting up food or eating a packet of crisps than playing with a rubber band or something. But maybe it's also due to conditioning ever since we were young.

It's mostly because I'm depressed though. I'm depressed because of the very real problems I have that are unfixable. I feel no joy, ever. I only tolerate life so I don't try to kill myself and end up as a vegetable instead. And I'm so desperate to have any sort of joy during the day that I turn to food. I literally wake up in the morning wondering if there's anything sugary in the cubboards or if I can get something at university. I literally look forward to the specific days of the week where I'll inevitably eat junk food.

Sometimes I wish I actually did gain weight. Because I've always been at a normal weight, though skinny-fat and with insulin resistance, that just never budged in either direction. At least if I were overweight or fat, maybe the disgust towards my body would be enough of a motivator to start eating healthy. Because with my body, no one would ever think I have a bad relationship with food or have a high chance of developing diabetes.",1582702780.0

I put on 4 stone due to all I can guess was metabolic issues (I was in hospital eating set meals while still gaining). Soon after I had these intense cravings for pizza from dominos pretty much every week. I carried on this way for years until I went on a Keto diet which cuts out basically all carbs. I went to a party and decided I‚Äôd have a pizza from the pizza van as a special treat. Then I was back on the takeaways. I also would order from other places such as kebabs, subway, McDonald‚Äôs etc. Now I probably eat out 2-3 times a week. 

These last couple of weeks I have been trying portion control without much luck. I did initially lose a bit of weight but I have eaten out so much this last week and big portions. Which has really messed up my weight loss. I have a job that burns a lot of calories so I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll be easier in the long term. I gathered maybe I can still eat out or order in aslong as it fits my calorie intake. This is still very expensive but I feel like it‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôm going to lose weight. 

Does this sound like a food addiction? Or could it be just I enjoy the buzz feeling of eating out/ordering in?",1582046854.0

I Think I Legit Have A Food Addiction,18,f50mey,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/f50mey/i_think_i_legit_have_a_food_addiction/,21,"I'm 33, nearly 34, been overweight my entire life and deal with depression and anxiety. And for the longest time I thought I stress ate to cope with the depression and anxiety. But I'm wondering if I have a food addiction that is fueling them instead.

Against my better judgment I started reading articles online about food addiction, thinking I was going to read myself into some psychosomatic episode. But reading the articles and taking stock of my eating habits, it really does seem like I have one.

I don't have much in the way of a sweet tooth, but definitely carbs and they usually come in the form of some kind of take out/fast food. Here are some of the habits I thought about:

* Spend a TON of money on take out. I'd estimate between $90-$120 a week.

* I eat WAY too much. I'm not talking the kind of full you get from going out to all you can eat sushi once in awhile. I mean, my stomach hurts, but I'll keep eating it because I want to taste it.

* The cravings are ridiculous. I work in factory and we are currently closed for slow season until March, so I'm trying to ration my food because my money is very limited at the moment. I noticed last week that I had strange cravings, but I was proud of myself that I had gone what felt like a really long time without caving, felt like a week or more. I checked the calendar, it was 3 days.

* I absolutely lie or will try to hide how much I eat. Often times I will get pizza a few times a week, a couple larges can last me 4 days if I'm disciplined, 2 days, if I'm not disciplined, that night if I'm binging. So pizza boxes tend to pile up. When taking the pizza boxes to the recycling in my building, I will only take 2-4 pizza boxes at a time, any more than that and I don't want anyone to see how much I eat.

I've wondered about this for awhile, because I've had these habits for over a decade. But I kinda wrote it off as me just lacking discipline and being weak. I have a doctor's appointment on the 24th, so I am going to talk to my dr about it then. But right now I am just sitting here just processing all of this. It's weird, because I've been a pothead since high school. But I've taken breaks throughout my life (like not smoke for a week or a month at a time), just to make sure it doesn't become an addiction. No issues with drinking either. I barely touch alcohol, but I never thought food would be what I'm addicted to.",1581901904.0

I think I am in hell,12,f1pi2x,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/f1pi2x/i_think_i_am_in_hell/,7,"Short intro: I have always suffered some kind of depression/low self-esteem since I was strikingly little. I am also way, way more serious and ""in depth"" (at least superficially) than people my age (I am 20).
I've always been skinny, and often mocked because of it.
For great part of my life, that wasn't a big problem, there were other aspects that troubled me.
The shit started to hit the fan when I got the opportunity to study biochemistry with a wonderful prof, who is also an athlete and a nutrition expert.
He taught me it all: all the hormones, the pathways, role of vitamins, and the energetic homeostasis control settings that our amazing body has.
I was so enthusiastic about this that I started to applicate all this knowledge into my life.
And with that, orthorexia ensued.
I couldn't even watch a cookie. I know all the effects of the seed oils, their method of extraction and their goddamn smoking point.
This all happened at the start of last year. Then things became worse.
My self esteem crashed, because of bad sexual experiences, lack of interesting and supporting people around me and too much time spent by myself.
One day (it was March I think) I looked at myself in the mirror. I am a very active person, and I was exercising pretty much every day. Turns out that I had a little bit of fat on my ass. That should be funny. But for my brain it wasn't.
It was horrible. So I said ""I am going to get thin"".
And so I did.
Went into full blown anorexia. Fasted for three days, then started to eat only vegetables and a little bit of lean protein.
In a month, I lost 5 kgs.
The anorexic phase lasted all summer, with the peak reached in August (I was 48 kg for 1.90 mt. guy).
I've spent all the summer closed in my house, fasting, obsessing over food and growing more and more desperate.
Then something switched in my mind, and I recognized that I was in big, big trouble.
After horrible adventures with doctors who wanted to hospitalize and sedate me, I was able to get a grip on my sanity and I started to eat again.
Unfortunately, now I am binge eating almost constantly.
There aren't trigger foods: as long as I fast I am fine. Once I start eating, I am a bottomless pit.
I am going to the gym every day in order to use the ungodly amounts of calories that I swallow.
But it's becoming more and more frustrating. I feel so alone and lonely.
I tried every diet. Every nutrient dense food. And I regained weight, mostly muscle, thanks to my everyday workouts. But still I am so, so frustrated.
I am an attractive guy and I was full of dreams. Now I know only fear and disgust for myself. I am destroying my health.
I try to repair with fasting and exercise-but I know it's not sustainable. The people around me are supporting,but I feel so miserably alone, they can't get the amount of suffering and the horrible easiness that triggers my brain to go berserk over food. That is all I am. An addicted who can't resist temptation.

I've been struggling with food for quite some time, and it wasn't until recently that I realized I could probably categorize my experience as food addiction.
My mom passed away in November of 2018, and I think that's when it started. My metabolism used to be great- I could eat whatever I wanted and never gain any weight. It was awesome.
But when my mom died, I ate all the time, as much as I could, to cope with the grief. I wasn't expecting to gain so much weight. On the BMI scale I'm classified as overweight, and I never thought that would happen. I thought my metabolism would still be fine, since it had been for the longest time, but I started putting on pounds. Not very quickly, but not slowly either.

I hate my body. I hate my belly. I hate my thighs. I hate my back. I feel so self conscious walking around anywhere now, and it's so hard to push what I look like now out of my head. But despite this, I eat. I feel the need to eat until I'm uncomfortably full. It's almost like as soon as I start I can't stop. And it's so frustrating.

I want help. But I don't know where to start. I've briefly mentioned eating problems to my therapist, but she hasn't really given me solid advice that I can use to fight this addiction. I also briefly brought it up with my dad, but he simply said I was making problems that weren't there.

I feel so helpless. I want to be healthy. I want to be in shape. I want control over my eating habits again. Please, give me advice. Thank you all so much for existing and being here. I hope we can all make it through this.",1579848339.0

The interesting thing is that my body fat is now considered ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù my muscles are considered ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (which is good), but I‚Äôm still technically overweight - 155lbs at 5‚Äô4‚Äù female 36 years old. 
And I keep overeating since getting these measurements.
Shouldn‚Äôt all this accountability make me more motivated to watch every morsel?

I have beaten a shopping addiction.

I CANNOT for the life of me beat this. And after losing 100+ pounds, it's just gotten worse. I FEEL STARVED even when I'm not. I'm depressed because my life has turned into literally Go To Work & Exercise in ALL your free time.

I'm afraid of myself, the cravings are overwhelming. I'd like to think that being mentally well and keeping the weight off are the most important things, but when sugar is around, it's like ALL OF THAT GOES AWAY.

When I don't start eating, I have no problem just...not eating. But the second I take ONE BITE of literally anything, even lettuce, it's like the monster wakes up and I either don't want to stop or can't stop, and I can't tell the difference. I never feel satisfied.

I WISH SO BADLY FOR A PILL TO  JUST SATISFY ALL FOOD NEEDS.

This is RUINING me and taking away my life.

Does anyone relate, and has anyone actually ever gotten better? I feel completely hopeless and broken. I've been addicted to food my WHOLE life. I'm turning 33 next month, and I'm basically just depressed that I'm even still alive. Like...what am I alive for? To eat? To constantly live in the very real fear of regaining all the weight? Or more?

The only thing that feels worse than feeling like this is feeling like this AND being obese again. I'm tortured by the fact that this will be my reality again if I can't fix my addiction.

HELP. Anyone who can help. PLEASE.

Thank you.

From under the protection of the cloak I don‚Äôt care if you like me because what you‚Äôre getting isn‚Äôt really me. It‚Äôs just a reflection, a surface image meant to hide what‚Äôs really inside. 

From here I‚Äôm just another [fat girl](https://www.myinnerculture.com/heal/2019/2/20/any-arbys-or-horsey-sauce-with-that). No one really looks at us. You don‚Äôt notice when my clothes don‚Äôt fit right, or if I sneak up for seconds at the buffet--and if you do, you shrug and say, ‚ÄúOf course, she‚Äôs fat.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have to smile at the cashier, or wave hello to the person I vaguely recognize down the department store aisle. No one expects me to sign up for committees, care about the environment, comb my hair, or chime into that group text. No one thinks I‚Äôll do great things so I‚Äôll never disappoint them if I don‚Äôt.¬† I am anonymous. I am a ghost. 

I am invisible. And it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve survived. 

The scariest part about sharing my story is knowing‚Äîif I was going to tell the truth‚ÄîI would have to finally shed the cloak. Not just the [weight ](https://www.myinnerculture.com/meanderings)that has kept me hidden, but every protection mechanism I‚Äôve garnered since childhood when the need to protect myself from things I couldn‚Äôt control emerged. What I found cowering beneath the layers was the same terrified little girl that went into hiding in the first place. She‚Äôs just a kid looking for safety and acceptance, but is so afraid she won‚Äôt find it that she destroys her outer shell so she‚Äôll be too damaged venture out into an unforgiving world.  Hunkered amid piles of [chicken strips and pizza](https://www.myinnerculture.com/heal/2018/9/18/the-dissolution-of-a-food-culture), where she can quietly drown in her compulsions without anyone noticing, is like being among old, non-judgmental friends. They are her saviors.

In a recent meditation I found that scared, stubborn child sitting in the dark. I knew if I didn‚Äôt show her there was nothing to be afraid of she‚Äôd continue to hide, and her protective methods would never cease. I‚Äôd never be free. Lately she‚Äôs been rebelling. As if she senses a [new phase of life](https://www.myinnerculture.com/heal/2018/9/28/creating-a-new-food-culture) is beginning she clings to the past and all things familiar, and desperately seeks to[ stay hidden ](https://www.myinnerculture.com/create/2018/10/2/the-house-i-built-for-myself)where nothing changes. I can‚Äôt let her do that this time. 

Writing about my struggles is shedding the cloak. Speaking my truth‚Äîto myself and everyone else‚Äîreveals an ankle. Facing myself in the mirror, even when it hurts, reveals a wrist. Staying present with whatever comes loosens the fabric from around my neck. Taking my power back, respecting my body and soul, and confronting my fears pulls the hood off my face.

I said, ""You're right."" and told one of the boys to put it in the freezer. She said ""The freezer wouldn't stop me from eating it..."" She knew.

Well, I've been having an unhealthy relationship with food, to say the least. Not any kind of food, it's mainly fast food, and mostly, KFC. I never really liked the place before, but recently I've been going whenever I have the chance. I am currently in my first year of Medical school, and it has been tiring and really stressful till now, and I know it doesn't get any easier. I guess the way that I have been coping with stress, be it my personal anxiety or any stress related to my studies, was by eating in such places. I have to say that I have a limited allowance and so I am spending most of it on food, and this is causing trouble. I'd be studying in the library, I finish a chapter or two, and as a reward to myself I go and get that crispy strips meal that I've been literally hooked on for a while, all large size and most of the times I would add 2 more strips, which would add up to 7 pieces with all the stuff that comes with it. I sit there and usually watch something on the phone while eating, like a comedy series episode or something. I guess I've conditioned my body to enjoy food more when I am watching something with it. More than once I borrowed money from my friends saying I needed money to go home by taxi, and I'd use the money for KFC, or Mcdonalds or any fast serving place with WiFi inside. My life in the past months became literally: going to classes, eating, then studying, then eating, then studying some more, then eating, and if I'm studying late back at home I'd also eat whatever option I like in the fridge. I gained weight, and I'm on the verge of obesity. It's causing me constant demotivation and depression, and of course, the only way I know how to deal with such emotions is by eating. Even if there is good food at home, I prefer faking an excuse to go out and eat somewhere, alone.

Advice on eating until full and eating only when hungry?,13,ein244,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/ein244/advice_on_eating_until_full_and_eating_only_when/,9,"I‚Äôve come to realize because of my food addiction and because of my structured day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) I don‚Äôt eat when I‚Äôm actually hungry.

On the flip side, how do I tell when I‚Äôm full? I can tell when I‚Äôve eaten too much to the point of feeling stuffed, but at what point should I normally be stopping? If I eat a smaller portion I‚Äôll just get hungrier faster, and sometimes I can‚Äôt eat then because I‚Äôm in class. How do I find the right balance?",1577909489.0

It tastes like heaven. My addiction took over me and I started googling different recipes for lower-calorie meals I could make instead of the alfredo (to at least make myself feel a little better about binging) Then it hit me. I gave away all the pasta in the pantry!!!!!!!!!!! And I just came back home from a LOOOOONG day. I‚Äôm not going back out there.

As a young kid (i‚Äôm sure like many people) Mcdonald‚Äôs and junk food were like the biggest treat of my life. But for me  I would literally cry when I was unable to get junk food as a kid. I remember my older brother telling me at 11 years old that I was addicted to food but ofc i never took it seriously. 

Well, this obsession didn‚Äôt stop there and as an adult after years of basing my life around food and dealing w abuse, mental illness, etc. I found myself literally gorging myself on junk food/ordering delivery 3-4 times a day. I literally never cook +  the depression plays a huge part in it since I self isolate constantly and never eat at the table. It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I‚Äôve gained 70-90lbs over the course of 2 years. 

I don‚Äôt know how the fuck to get out of this cycle. I‚Äôve been trying to see food as simply fuel but it seems almost impossible considering the part food played in my life since childhood. I did have a good streak going where I tried keto and I felt absolutely amazing and dropped 50lbs over the course of 7 months and then college came around and the binging and constant overeating led to me gaining 30lbs back. 

As a child, my family was able to control my access to how much food i ate, what type, and when, but now i have the funds and the easy access w nothing holding me back. I‚Äôm stuck, and I truly don‚Äôt know what to do, i didn‚Äôt think it was serious until my mom was looking at me in shock with all the deliveries and the amount of food I consumed on the daily. 

I hope someone out there in a similar situation has advice that worked for them. It‚Äôs embarrassing to say that I have a food addiction but I think I truly do. Spending all day thinking about what you‚Äôre going to eat next even while full is a problem. Sorry for the long block of text.

I've been overweight my entire life. I grew up in an unhappy home with an alcoholic mother and an absent, but very nasty dad. When other relatives found out about my mothers alcoholism and after a string of events (she lost her driving licence and nearly died), I went to live with my grandparents, my grandad was terminally ill and my grandmother was very loving, but had a very bad temper, she became unwell in my late teens. I also managed undiagnosed epilepsy until I was in my mid-20's (I had a diagnosis of panic attacks and fainting from age 7), I am now medicated with anti-convulsants.

I have always used food to self-soothe. 

When I was a teen, friends of mine self-harmed, and other kids used drugs and drank excessively.. and I used to feel proud that I was able to 'cope' without resorting to such things.. unaware that my use of food was a form of addiction, a form of self-harm. I was badly bullied for my weight as a teenager and resorted to unhealthy measures to try and lose weight, to no success. 

My weight has yo-yo'd in my adult life, though I have always felt the same size, and I've always seen the same person looking at me in the mirror. I have worn clothes from UK size 12 to 26. 

After the death of my grandmother and diagnosis of epilepsy, I dropped out of university. I was a UK size 14, weighing about 210lbs. My acne quickly returned, and I slipped into comfort eating again.. shortly after, my best friend attempted suicide. By the end of the year I had ballooned to over 330lbs. 

Over the 3 years that followed, I have lost 110lbs. I still see the 330lb+ person looking back at me in the mirror, in pictures, in reflections as I walk down the street. I am obsessed with losing 50lbs, having skin removal surgery and being 'normal', but I hate myself so much, I just can't find the motivation to make it happen right now.

I wear a fitbit HR, I have been eating at a 500-1000 calorie deficit, counting calories using myfitnesspal, resistance training and exercising using my stationary bike.. but my weight hasn't budged in weeks. I am so exhausted from depression, that I can't find the energy to give more. In the last few days, I have just given in. I ate at maintenance, but I know that if I wasn't really losing at deficit, I will surely gain at maintenance.. 

I went on holiday recently, and all I felt was nothing. Apathy. Food is the only thing that is bringing me any pleasure, comfort, joy. Why am I depriving myself something that takes me to my happy place, when I can't find happiness in anything else right now? I'm trying to heal a heartbreak right now, so I thought, maybe it would be a good idea to try online dating again. All I've had is guys either fetishising or soliciting me. I feel so dirty, degraded and gross.. Just by having a profile.

Today I ate a box of cheese twists dipped in cream cheese, 2 duck breasts, polenta, asparagus, and peas with beef gravy, and a slice of cake, and 3 chocolates. All I could think about was heading to the freezer and eating a tub of ice-cream, but I managed to resist it. 2131 calories, with drinks (coffee and orange juice).

Anyway, that's me and my vent.",1576885965.0

Conflicted - moderation or abstinence?,15,e3w4kq,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/e3w4kq/conflicted_moderation_or_abstinence/,10,"From what I see, the general public/medical consensus is moderation, mostly whole foods, but occassional treats are fine. I've been in eating disorder treatment and that's the undisputed standard of care. I've seen a lot of formerly obese/eating disordered people who have maintained healthy habits for a long time preach that this is the way to go. They do say that stricter control can be used in the beginning to make sure you are doing the right thing physically, but mainly calorie and nutrient counting and nothing like cutting out entire groups of food. The binge eating sub also seems pro intuitive eating. 

Then I see this sub and other food addiction sources promoting abstinence. I'm keto OMAD myself, even avoiding (but not strictly excluding) some zero carb foods that are semi-triggers for me, like cheese, salty cured sausages and diet drinks. I've been binge free for 6 months for the first time in my life. But it's still a short time, and I've always relapsed in the past. Sometimes I wonder if I'm deluding myself and it's only working because I'm redirecting my eating disorder into restriction instead of fixing the core issue. Sometimes I feel like an anti-vaxx conspiracy theorist going against the medical advice. Everyone tells me that's what is happening and I'm going to make it worse.

I don't know what to believe. Is it really the case of ""whatever works for you""? How do I know it works for me? I don't have cravings and I don't obsessively think about food anymore, but it's not effortless either. I feel like something is missing, like I'm holding my breath all the time.

I gained a lot of weight in 2008/9 due to it (coupled with alcoholism) and while I‚Äôm almost 2 years sober from alcohol I‚Äôm still 290lbs. I haven‚Äôt dated or anything at all during that period and I feel like being morbidly obese weighs on me (no pun intended) and makes it impossible to be happy. I doubt I will ever get married or have kids which is what it is but being an obese woman just limits a lot of things.
Anyway, now they I‚Äôve droned on- I‚Äôd love to have accountability buddies that I can check in with and vice versus to keep accountable for not binging. Anyone interested?",1575053247.0

I always think what's on the menu today. What will I eat now and what I'll eat after. What desert to eat. There's always cake. I'm at the point where I'm super ashamed of myself. After realise Ng what I've become and what I am. I feel insecure to eat out anymore. I feel insecure to eat if I'm hungry after my main meal of the day ( like couple of hours after). I drink a heck ton of tea and exercise. And feel depressed. And crave food while severely hating myself and being disgusted over what I am and what I've done to myself. Lately I got comments from owe family members saying I've gotten fat. I've been dieting my entire life and have only once being at my target weight. What a failure I am :)

I used to be nearly 400 pounds. One day I woke up and decided I didn‚Äôt want to be that big anymore. Over the next year I lost 160 pounds. It was healthy, all diet and exercise. 

That was 4 years ago. Recently, I‚Äôve gained 90 pounds back. I try, so so so hard. In the mornings I start off well‚Äîeat light, small amounts of food. But in the evening, when I come home, I eat and cannot stop. I eat until I feel sick, wait about 30 minutes until the feeling is gone, and eat some more. I know I shouldn‚Äôt do it as I‚Äôm eating it, but I can‚Äôt stop myself. My clothes are starting not to fit, and that‚Äôs more discouraging than ever. 

I know I have underlying psychological issues from a traumatic childhood. I‚Äôve tried therapy, it hasn‚Äôt really worked. I LOVED being healthy. But for some reason, that goes out of my head as soon as I see food when I get home.

I‚Äôve gone so long without takeaway,24,dxqm2z,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/dxqm2z/ive_gone_so_long_without_takeaway/,3,"Might not seem a lot but I‚Äôve been a whole week without any takeaway for dinner. This would usually include pizza, curry, kebab or any other type of greasy food with a very high calorie count. I am not a binge eater particularly but I would feast on these takeaways and only specifically takeaways I had cravings for. I believe it may have been because of my medication. It‚Äôs known to effect dopamine pathways and they say a lot of food addiction is to do with that. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm cured as it‚Äôs only been a week. But this is the longest I‚Äôve been in bloody ages. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve been fighting the cravings. They haven‚Äôt particularly been there. 

Last Sunday I had a Pizza Hut and ordered a large pizza and a garlic tear and share. Usually I could demolish this. This would be like a maximum order I‚Äôd go for but it‚Äôs not something I couldn‚Äôt handle. I ate only the garlic bread and a couple of slices of the pizza on Sunday night and didn‚Äôt fancy anymore until the next day where I ate the rest. It was actually a reasonable portion size I felt for a normal person so I was pretty weirded out by myself. Since then I‚Äôve had a couple of nights where my girlfriend cooked. A few nights of eating by myself. Not particularly healthy meals at home but not that bad either. But I hear it‚Äôs best not to go from food addiction straight to dieting anyway so I guess I done the right thing. The meals I cook are often uninspiring and when I do cook a nice meal I think I will really like it but don‚Äôt and the leftovers will be chucked. When my girlfriend cooks I love it and i wang more. So I‚Äôm very grateful for that. Anyway today I did go out for breakfast with my girlfriend and got an ice cream later but I wouldn‚Äôt class those as one of those meals I particularly crave. So I still think I‚Äôm doing well. And I think once a week treat is definitely more sensible to 3-4 times a week I was doing. Anyway just thought I‚Äôd share my supposed success story. Whether or not I‚Äôve somehow improved in the long term I am yet to see. I think a reduction in my meds may have helped but again I‚Äôm not sure",1574016678.0

My partner and I moved to a different state which lead to some pretty big let downs career wise for me. That, I think, put me in a mildly depressed state. I think I stared eating to feel better. Now, I don‚Äôt even feel better when I eat, usually I feel worse. 

This really hit me tonight, when I ate reasonably all day. Then, on my way to work despite not being hungry, pulled through McDonald‚Äôs anyway. (I don‚Äôt even really like McDonald‚Äôs). I acknowledged I wasn‚Äôt even really interested but I did it anyway. My partner doesn‚Äôt know how often I eat fast food because I‚Äôm pretty embarrassed. I often eat it at work (nights) or around lunch time while she is at work. I have to hide receipts and bags from her. In the last two months I‚Äôve probably eaten fast food 5-6 days every week on top of regular meals. I‚Äôm about 30 pounds heavier than I was when we moved here despite regular exercise. I‚Äôm at risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.

I don‚Äôt want to live this way. But even when I have meal prepped I‚Äôve ignored that food in the fridge and opted for fast food anyway. I don‚Äôt eat particularly large amounts. For example tonight I got a quarter pounder and a 10 piece nugget with a medium fry. I ate 3/4 of the burger, most of the fries, and about 8 nuggets before I was done and felt disgusting.

Soda, energy drinks, coffee, whatever. I don‚Äôt have the means to see a therapist right now. I‚Äôm curious on people‚Äôs thoughts. So do I have an addiction, or do I simply lack self control? Either way I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I‚Äôve tried quitting cold turkey many times and always end up saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù. I had two weeks where I agreed to go keto with my partner and I dropped ten pounds. But I hated having to eat that way. I was often angry and mind was always on food.

I've been struggling with body image and food most of my life. I started to notice how fat I was in elementary and tried to eat better even at a young age. I knew pretty fast because of how other kids treated me that i looked different from the others. And that your looks will get you things or more likely to be favored. I've had restrictive Behavior in highschool before I even knew what restricting was. But this year it has been the worst for my depression and my mental health. Late last year and beginning of this year I was loosing weight basically by not eating and fasting constantly. I believe during this time (I don't know my memory is so bad) I was a bit sad, I was in a failing relationship and he didn't understand anything about mental health so it got worse until I broke it off. I was still ""taking care"" of myself but once I my weight plateau I took a turn for the worse. I started to give up. I worked out less but i ate less too. I was slipping so far into anorexia I was finally trying laxatives because I was so desperate. Then I met my current boyfriend and got a lil more comfortable. I was eating more and working out but then my mood started dropping again and I got even worse. Crying fits, anger spells, memory dissapearing its like I'm deteriorating. I started to eat junk and so much of it for a couple of months or so and it got really bad. I tried taking back control by trying the keto diet but I apparently bought many things that weren't low carb and said FUCK IT IMA EAT AND NOT CARE so now I'm eating my life away just binging constantly. Like eating something every other hour and I think I'm starting to become numb. I don't really feel ""sad"" just there. Like I'm ignoring it I guess. My boyfriend says the food is helping me forget :( now I'm stuck and idk what to do 

SOME FACTS:
I'm very critical about my and others bodies. I've broken up and fought with people who would compliment me even with my own boyfriend :( 

I have to go outside looking a certain way or I'll feel ""less than"" or ugly in some way.

I‚Äôm 30 90kg 5‚Äô10 so maybe not too badly overweight. My problem is takeaways though. I never used to get takeaways like I do now. Growing up it was a non issue. It‚Äôs only when I went through metabolic changes from medication in which made me put on weight did things change. I would have them once a week and always a greasy pizza but I felt like this was too much even then. I always felt so guilty and couldn‚Äôt give them up. I spent a lot of money on it. Went on a diet then when I came off I noticed my takeaway count has doubled. Instead of having one every 7 days I have one every 3 days without fail. Give or take a day I always ensure I have one. The only difference is that I have different things now not just pizza. I have kebabs, Indian, Chinese or pizza. For some reason if I went out for a meal or had a McDonald‚Äôs lunch or something I wouldn‚Äôt count that as my 3 daily takeaway. It HAS to be takeaway for the craving to be fulfilled. Today I had 5 pound in the bank to last me until Friday and knew I couldn‚Äôt get a takeaway with what I had left so I actually went overdrawn so I could have takeaway. My gf was pretty annoyed with me and I don‚Äôt blame her. I have such a battle with myself in my head every time I want one but know I shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm worried what it‚Äôs going to do to me. Also I don‚Äôt understand if this is an addiction or maybe an eating disorder or I don‚Äôt know. I feel like it could be some sort of psychological thing to do with dopamine for instance.

I feel like my only hope is when I live with my gf it‚Äôll stop or maybe I‚Äôll continue and we will argue about it and break up. Sounds dramatic but it could happen

EDIT to give it a metaphorical comparison I would say it‚Äôs like a meter where eating what I got at home is on one side and ordering in a takeaway is on another. It feels like wherever the arrow points I must do that. Last night I was trying to make myself WANT to eat at home. I was going back and forth a lot but eventually the meter fell on takeaway and I felt at that point I caved in because I was tired of trying to reason with myself",1572894205.0

I have tried a few times to lose weight but every time I end up gaining more weight. I hit my highest and I broke down.

I am 30 years old and I have had an unhealthy relationship with food since I was 12 years old. I developed and my hips were very curvy in a time where being rail thin was in. I thought being a size 0 was the best when I was in a size 7/9, 130 lbs at 5'7 (I was healthy and looked good but never saw it). I started starving myself and would never lose a jean size. I would then binge and eat everything. This cycle would continue for years and my weight only fluctuated by 10 lbs. The only relationship I had with food was to eat everything in sight or eat nothing at all.

Fast forward to my late 20s and my metabolism slowed down and it was harder to maintain the weight. I gained 80lbs. I had dreams about eating. The feeling I got from food, the complete comfort it gave. I would spend hours at work planning what I would eat when I got home. I will eat whole bags of chips, candy, ice cream, whole pizzas, pasta, you name it. I HAD to finish whatever I was eating, even if it made me sick. I would always hide my eating of course. Always eating alone in my room. Throwing the wrappers and containers in the bottom if the trash bin and hiding things over it.

I would go on diets but got so overboard and restrictive I became obessed with CICO and how healthy everything was and how much I was working out. It is impossible to keep that up so I would spiral and go into binge eating again. The cycle is vicious.

I found keto and it changed my life. I have lost over 30 lbs so far. I still have binge and addiction issues but am working on my relationship with food. Moderation is a word I am trying to learn. That food is not evil or a best friend. It is just food.

It is a long road and as I am typing this I am fighting cravings to go out and stuff my face, but I won't because it won't make me happy and the comfort it gives is false.

In my single days, when no one but maybe a roommate would be around, I'd sneak my multiple drive thru purchases into my room before anyone noticed. That's when I could wait until I got home to eat. Other times I'd stop in the nearest parking lot and shove everything in as fast as I could.
I'd go to Krispy Kreme and order extra napkins so maybe, just maybe, the cashier didn't suspect they were all for me. If I ordered multiple drinks, I would say ""I want a Coke and they want (insert sugary drink here) to make it look like the entire order wasn't for me. 
I'd go on bouts if clean eating, drinking healthy smoothies. I'd lose 25 lbs, go back to my old ways and gain it all back.
Cue marriage. I married another overweight person. We love food. We eat out a lot and it shows. When I married I weighted about 280. I'm now at about 320.
I'm the heaviest I have ever been. I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, inflammation issues, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and most recently, full blown diabetes. I have depression and anxiety that I have battled since high school. Everything hurts. Every step is a chore. And although I've always been overweight by any doctor's standards, I never walked like a fat person, or so I was told. Now I do. I waddle and huff and puff. Btw I'm only 5 foot 4 inches tall.
So why, after all this time, and all these ailments, have I not been scared into action? It's like the more I have wrong with me, the more I wave the white flag and dig deeper into food and drinks.
And we're not just talking too many Cokes. I'm ashamed to admit that I have recently been ADDING sugar to drinks, mostly Powerade. I take a few big sips and then pour sugar in until it reaches the top and shake shake shake. It's like I cant get enough sugar. I even poured sugar into a regular coke the other day. They obviously dont make a drink sweet enough for me. Last night I even laid in bed and couldn't go to sleep until I went to the kitchen and made my concoction, complete with white bread that I rolled up and dipped into butter. It was the perfect carby snack, washed down with a sweet sweet drink.
I dont know what to do. I'm obviously on a fast path to destruction health wise. My family doesnt help. They're all enablers. We all enable each other. My husbands doesnt have the secret binges (that I know of) but we all ear guilty of not taking care of ourselves.
I'm sharing because I feel i have reached the extreme of extremes. Anyone else feel like they're last the point of no return?
I love my family doctor but each visit yields bloodwork that keeps getting worse. I don't want her to just throw her hands up because I have no self control. 
Counseling doesnt work either. I've already been down that path with depression and I just tell them what they want to hear and never change my ways.

Creature of Habit,13,d126xt,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/d126xt/creature_of_habit/,2,"I just want to vent a little. I didn‚Äôt know for a long time if what I do counted as an addiction, but I‚Äôve come to realize it is.

I dieted for a year and lost 35 pounds. I did have my rough patches along the way, but I made it. I was so happy. I could wear clothes that I liked and felt comfortable in. I could wear a swimsuit without covering my midsection. My thighs didn‚Äôt chafe when I walked.

But then, since I had reached my goal, my habits had to change. I couldn‚Äôt keep eating 1300 calories a day or I‚Äôd start losing muscle, too. I had been on a diet for so long, I didn‚Äôt know how to adjust it properly.

I went to Japan for two weeks. Due to my picky palate and dislike of seafood, I ate nothing but fast food for those two weeks. From there, it only got worse.

I stopped taking my anxiety medication. Not on purpose, I just forgot to take it. I was trying to get food under control again, so I ate at weird times and forgot to take my meds when I did (I have to take it with food). This sent me into withdrawal. A symptom of withdrawal for me is insatiable hunger. Literally cannot get enough.

I‚Äôve been trying to get myself back on track for a year. I‚Äôve gained 65 pounds, which means I‚Äôm 30 pounds heavier than I was when I started dieting two years ago. I‚Äôm not as heavy as many in this sub (5‚Äô7‚Äù female, 205lbs), but it‚Äôs hard. I gained 40 of those 65 pounds in only two months. That‚Äôs 5 pounds a week. I‚Äôm covered in stretch marks because it was so fast.

Nothing that worked the first time is working this time. I printed pictures of thin girls in cute outfits (I‚Äôm a girl) and taped them to my fridge, front door, car visor, anywhere I might see when I was having cravings. I‚Äôve tried romanticizing healthy food and tea over bad food and coffee, to get myself to look past the lesser taste in favor of the ‚Äú~ ooh I‚Äôm so fancy drinking my tea and eating a rice cake ~‚Äù feeling. I have reminders in my phone set to go off every 2-3 hours with motivational phrases specifically tailored to me and my history with my weight. Some are gentle, and some are more aggressive. I need both in balance if I‚Äôm going to do this again.

But I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôm tired of counting calories and telling myself no. I‚Äôm tired of looking longingly at the coffee pot while I drink my tea, knowing that having coffee means having coffee creamer, which is too many calories. I‚Äôm tired of trying to stick to a diet when hanging out with friends who suggest fast food or baking sweets. I‚Äôm tired of feeling left out of social gatherings because beer and wine will break my diet. I‚Äôm tired of my family joking that they‚Äôre sorry for ‚Äúbreaking [my] diet‚Äù whenever we go out to eat for a special occasion.

I‚Äôm also tired of seeing my stretch marks in the mirror. I‚Äôm tired of being winded after one flight of stairs. I‚Äôm tired of nothing in my closet fitting anymore. I‚Äôm tired of sticking my tongue to the roof of my mouth to hide my double chin in photos. I‚Äôm tired of hating myself.

I guess I just needed to vent this. I‚Äôm craving right now and I need to remember why I‚Äôm doing this again. I just want to get back to where I was, and I‚Äôm sad and angry that I ever lost it. If anyone has any tips for psychologically beating out this addiction that has already been beaten once, I‚Äôd gladly take them. It‚Äôs smarter now that it knows how I motivated myself before. I can‚Äôt use the same weapons because they don‚Äôt work. Thanks for reading.",1567892927.0

I weight 270 pounds. 180 of which is muscle, but I can't control myself around food. I can't say no. 

I hide my eating habits from the people that love me because I know it hurts them. 

Today I had the house to myself for 2 hours. I ate two full bags of Doritos with a huge thing of chip dip. I hid the garbage. Then when my wife got home I didn't want her to know I ate already so I ordered burritos for the both of us. 


People don't understand that it's not just a slice of pizza or cake. 
It sends me in a spiral. I will have 3 slices of the pizza you bought, then go home and order a large because i liked it. Then I'll eat like shit for a week or a month or 6 months before getting myself back on track.

DAY 11 (CURBING SUGAR),3,czh1fc,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/czh1fc/day_11_curbing_sugar/,1,"Today I decided to reintroduce sugar. I had a small stick ice cream after dinner as a dessert in a hope I could monitor there results and decide best how to start again on sugars without falling off the horse. I knew ice cream wasn't something that would set me off but the chocolate in it would be a good test of what to expect going forward.

I figured also sticking to a mini sticked ice cream rather than a tub, I could limit myself to one portion rather than taking a ridiculously big portion.

There were three things I found when eating the ice cream.

1) The ice cream was delicious, it was a dark chocolate ice cream and the dark chocolate (not normally my favourite) tasted so sweet and good. I think from this I have decided I will try to only eat darker chocolates etc, and make sure it's limited to a small portion or recommended portion on the back.

2) Straight after eating the chocolate, I felt very guilty. Although the chocolate ice cream was delicious it was the feelings of eating sugar that made me feel upset with myself even though I had told myself the one stick was okay. It made me want to stick to no sugar and I think this feeling is going to help in the future. I have decided to limit myself to one sweet treat a week maximum and it must be the correct serving size. 

3) My sugar levels again spiked and I had a short period where I really craved sweet food. It didn't last long but it was a quick spike of cravings immediately after the ice cream.",1567578112.0
Substituted addictions,10,cz4qjg,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/cz4qjg/substituted_addictions/,2,"I was raised by narcissistic drug addicts as well as narcissistic siblings. The years of abuse left me with a complex about myself for many years. I started drinking and smoking at an early age to not think about it anymore and I was out of control eating by the time I went to college. 

I had ballooned up to 250+ lbs and was miserable. I started yo-yo dieting and usually stayed between 200-230. I would always fall of the wagon and give up. One day I had had enough and decided to change. I bought an elliptical and I got a handle on the eating, quit smoking and finally quit drinking. I had lost 70 lbs and was in the best shape of my life.

But the negatives from my past came creeping back into my head. Everyone around me was not supportive, but rather negative about the new me. Their negativity began to affect me, it wasn't good enough. It's NEVER good enough... I started to doubt myself and doubt that I could maintain this for a long time. I started smoking weed to help calm my nerves and deal with the stressful situations in my life.

This backfired as it unleashed all my cravings for things and I bottled everything up into a sugar-laden binge of food. I quit smoking weed as it had contributed to my re-gain of the 70lb that I lost. I was depressed, fat again and sober. Three very hard things to deal with at the same time. My marriage was going down the toilet and I was afraid that my children would follow in my footsteps and get fat too. 

I let myself get back into the negativeness of my past and kept substituting addictions. I went from drinking and smoking to food and weed. I realized during this process that it is not the food that is the problem. Food addiction is just that, an addiction. It is a coping mechanism that we have developed to deal with our problems.

In order for us to lose weight, we first have to deal with our issues, the REAL reason why we use food as a drug. Once you find out the truth about yourself and what the problem is/was, you can then heal and put down the drug. Food is fuel, but food is also a drug. The difference is what you kind of food are you eating. The sugary, fatty, salty processed garbage sold to us en masse is the drug. Fruits, vegetables, lean meats and nuts/seeds/Grains are the real foods. Focus on the good stuff and leave the processed foods to the junkies. 

I'm losing weight again, this time slowly and not by trying. I just stopped eating so damn much. My portions used to be 1.5 times the size they are now. I go by the fist rule. If it is is bigger than both my fists, it's too much on my plate. Stay away from the junk, I cook everything I eat. If it is comes to in a box, bag or has instructions, I won't eat it. I found recipes that I like that are simple to make. It takes like 30 minutes most nights to cook dinner and about 2 hours of food prep on Sunday to make my lunches for the week. Or you can make an additional portion of dinner and eat it for lunch the next day. 

Either way, it takes about as much time as sitting in your car waiting on a fast food meal does. At least the home cooked meal won't kill you or be 1,350 calories in a bag...

Drink more water! You would be surprised to find out that many people who are overweight are dehydrated. I was surprised by this. A friend of mine who is a medical doctor explained that being dehydrated can cause a whole host of illnesses in people that we don't connect to water. Gallstones, kidney stones and utis can come from being chronically dehydrated. Stones form from lack of Bile can occur from poor diet and not drinking enough water. UTIs can come from a buildup of yeast which will accumulate because there's not enough water to flush it out. Ibs was another one and heartburn. It's crazy to think that just by drinking more water and less liquid sugar, you can heal the body. So, drink up. Water is good for you.",1567516536.0
DAY 10 (CURBING SUGAR),10,cz1lab,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/cz1lab/day_10_curbing_sugar/,0,"Today was tough being at home on crutches. I just wanted to open some biscuits or chips and snack out, I guess as a bit of a comfort for not being able to move around. 

I tried to make myself as busy as I could during the day to help pass the time. I even cleaned the room moving around on my hands and knees which was an interesting experience. 

My cravings were short and easy to get through however which is such a good feeling to how I felt last week. I find when I'm hungry I don't get the same cravings for sweet food and I can satisfy my hunger with less food. I don't feel hungry as often or as intense as I used to.

I am keen to reintroduce sugar slowly. I do enjoy cakes and sugars and I want to be at a stage in my life where I can enjoy a cake for someone's birthday but know how to limit it to a small piece. 

I think the key to this will be to do it slowly and to start with sugars I know I can handle and don't get cravings for. I think that will be the next stage to the journey and I will have to manage it carefully to not blow my plan out of the window. 

Glad I made it through though and glad to see the days rack up into double figures. 10 days sounds good. Hopefully I can add another 0 to the end one day in the future but for now it's just about handling each day still.",1567495679.0

It just felt sore after football and I didn't think too much of it until I went to the toilet in the middle of the night and couldn't walk. I ended up crawling back from the bathroom on my hands and knees and couldn't get back to sleep with my foot throbbing. 

When I woke up my foot was bruised and swollen so decided to head in to A and E and get it checked out. They gave me an ankle brace and crutches and said I would be off work this entire week and it would take 4-6 weeks to heal. 

I did have some sugar today in the form of some cola while in a and e. I shared a small bottle with my fiancee as we waited. I wasn't worried about the cola as this isn't one of my normal triggers and I can comfortably limit myself when it comes to coke. 

It didn't make me purge back in to sugar or over indulge but I did notice a couple of things.

First of all, I could notice my spike in energy after just a few sips. I noticed I had an instant rush of energy and my mind and body was moving faster than before. Normally when I would overeat on sugars, I couldn't notice much of a kick and if anything it made me more tired.

Secondly, I noticed after I had had the cola, my cravings for sugar were intensified. Not to the point they were at the start of the challenge but definitely stronger than I've had the last few days. I knew I could beat them and they would soon go away and sure enough in an hour or so my want for sugar had disappeared.

These next few days are going to be tough at home. Especially not being able to exercise yet alone walk around without crutches. I'm sure I'm going to crave a sweet food or two as a piece of comfort. I didn't expect this week was going to be a challenge like it's shaping out to be but that's the way life works. I just have to come out this week strong.

I never had big meals but I was always snacking. All of a sudden mid October eating just disgusted me.  Every time I ate I would just feel nauseous.  I was so proud. I thought I had finally fixed myself. I wasn't eating except once a day, and even then I wasn't loving and engorged in the food. By January 1st I was down to 242. On the third I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and put on insulin. Almost immediately all the cravings returned. I was put on a keto/low carb diet. I love pasta, bread, sweets. Now that I can't have those I try to distract my cravings by eating meat, eggs, cheese, other carbless foods but I still feel so empty. And I feel even more disgusting now than before. I eat so much that I get bad stomach pain or vomit, then I eat more, and its all greasy oily foods now. My face is breaking out, I am uncomfortable eating all these heavy foods, and I don't even enjoy them. I feel gross. I was even vegetarian before this for the plain reason that I don't enjoy meats. My body isn't used to these foods, it would feel disgusting if I ate one burger before, now there is a never ending stream of meat and cheese entering my body and even though I hate it I'm afraid to stop because if I do I'm going to resort back to sugary snacks and carbs and it could literally kill me.

So I grab two more, take them in to the bathroom and eat them. On the way out I grab two more before anyone notices. 30 minutes later it's lunch time and I grab another couple. 

This is the behaviour that made me realize I really have a problem and what made me start my detox a week ago. 

One week on and I stuck to the non sugary food items on the menu and didn't touch the sweet foods. It felt good watching that pile of biscuits deteriorate slowly without me touching it.

I'm now one week through. No sugary items. Healthier. More energetic. Sleeping better and feeling better.

Home baking is my biggest trigger by far and I am blessed I haven't been presented with this yet this week. So arriving there I couldn't be happier as she makes the best home baking I've ever tried. 

So we settle in, set up the board game and that's when she cracks out the treats. I knew this was more than likely to happen being games night, it's almost tradition to adorn the night with sweet foods. So they crack out the drinks first. None other than coke and blackcurrant juice. Drinks aren't really a trigger for me so this was an easy ""just water thanks"" for me. 

Then the other treats come out. Freddo chocolates, toffee pops biscuits, prawn cocktail chips. A week ago I would have eaten them all by myself. Today I said ""I'm not eating sugar"" and proceeded to watch the family consume these delicious treats while my stomach almost grew an arm reaching for them. It's safe to say the treats lasted a lot longer for the family this week than in previous weeks and I realized how quickly the snacks dissapear when I'm in action. 

The rest of the day was a breeze but that one moment was tough with temptation staring me in the face but I stayed strong yet again and am realizing the willpower I have.

She then finished passing them around and I was thinking to myself ""please don't give me one, please don't give me one."" She then pulled one of them out of the bag and offered it to me. My soul crushed. I couldn't tell a little 6 year old girl no so I took it and gave her a warm thank you that didn't match my feeling inside. I quickly tucked it in my jacket pocket and my first thought was ""where is the closest bin"".

Out of not putting things in the bin by principle and the thought of this little girl seeing me throw out her chocolate I decided to head home with it in my pocket. I walk 20 minutes to work and the walk home that small bite sized chocolate couldn't have felt heavier. The further I walked the sweeter the taste of it in my mind was. 

It happened to be at the peak time of my snacking 4pm. That one small snack. If I could just enjoy that one small piece of chocolate I would be fine. A normal person would eat it and feel content. But that one pack would just be the start for me. It would set off an unsatisfied quench for chocolate that wouldn't rest until I had consumed every caloric treat in the house. 

A family member was home and I chucked it to him without an option, before I could second guess myself and walked off. It's choices like this that make me proud. Having the ability to choose again is a good feeling and a feeling I feel that is getting easier. Before I would consume without even deciding if it was a good option. My body acted faster than my mind. I couldn't say no, yet alone think about saying no. It just happened. 

I am now finding foods that I enjoy that aren't riddled with sugar and it feels great to look forward to foods I wouldn't normally.

I am feeling changes in my body and mind and am thinking this journey is getting easier. If only slightly.

I went for a run today and a gym session in the morning and my body responded positively with lots of energy which was awesome. 

Still feeling incredibly hungry which I have no idea why, I'm eating a lot of carbs and food in general but for some reason my body is trying to tell me to eat sugars.

Book Recommendations Please?,3,cvlyr9,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/cvlyr9/book_recommendations_please/,3,"TLDR: looking for books on fat/salt/sugar addiction help that don't have the 12 step/AA program, life-coachy or spiritual take. I want dry, blunt, and scientific (anecdotal is okay too as I like hearing other people's stories).

It's been a long time coming. I'm finally admitting I have an issue with food. I'm addicted to eating the trifecta: fats, sugar, and salt. 

Addiction runs in the family on both sides, specifically prescription drug and alcohol. So does mental health issues such as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. Abuse is also common. Long story short, my depression and general anxiety has been an uphill battle my entire life. I feel I'm in a better place than I was, and I'm not addicted to drugs or alcohol, but there's still work to do, which is why I'm here.

I've known for a long time that I find comfort in eating sugar/fat/salt foods. They are my go-to for coping with life. I eat my feelings away. I once even ate to gain weight to protect myself from sexual harassment. Food always made me happy and safe no matter what. Now it makes me sad and incredibly depressed after I indulge in my chocolate, sunflower seeds, or bacon.

However, over the past few years, I've put on a lot of weight, and it's reaching a point where it's very uncomfortable. I know my food addiction is at the root. I need to get myself into a better relationship with food before I severely fuck up my chances of living the long life I've always dreamed of with my husband. There's a family history of diabetes on my father's side.

At the moment, I'm right smack in the middle of graduate school, and the provided health insurance sucks. I don't really have the time and finances at the moment to see a therapist once or twice a week like I would really prefer to. It may be more than a year before I get decent insurance. I'm persistent once I set my mind to something though, and admitting is truly half the battle for me. I need this to start asap. I've already started going to the gym with my husband and trying to plan out meals I like that aren't the trifecta and definitely more veggies.

I'm looking for books to help jump start my recovery. The 12 step or AA type programs aren't my jam. Neither are spiritual or art therapy types. I'm more looking for books that are...dry and matter-of-factly? Blunt but not life-coachy? Books that read like reports and research papers but not the actual papers since I have too much of those on my hands already haha.

DAY 2 (CURBING SUGAR),6,cvgrhn,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/cvgrhn/day_2_curbing_sugar/,1,"Another day down, I'm still hoping this journey gets easier. I find that throughout the day without binge eating I am becoming so so hungry. I resisted any sugars again today. The positive is that the weekend is now over which is the time I tend to consume the most, now hopefully a well structured work week and routine will help this first week fly by.

This is the first time I've made dietary changes on a weekend. I always tell myself that I'll start on Monday, a cheap excuse for me to binge endlessly on the weekends. By the time the weekend comes around my diet changes have reverted and I find myself in a vicious cycle telling myself this next week will be different almost justifying the more food I consume over the weekend. I'm glad I started on a Friday and getting through the weekend gives me huge motivation to keep going.

Sunday evening I felt like a snack as I normally do and have been all weekend and decided to treat myself, so bought something that me and my fiancee really enjoy, pita bread, crackers, hummus and tzatziki. Was very satisfying and I am starting to find healthy alternatives for snacking and as sugar is the only major problem in my diet it's not an issue. 

I did find the first aisle I went in to in the supermarket was the confectionery aisle and stopped and looked without even thinking. The little devil packets couldn't tempt me this time and having a healthy treat in mind and something to really look forward to rescued me and I think may be a regular treat on the weekends.

I have felt super hungry all day today I guess as a result of not gorging my face with biscuits and chocolate. I am hoping this real hunger will subside in the next few weeks as my body gets used to the lack of sugar.

I woke up today in a great frame of mind and told myself ""I don't need sugar"" over and over again in my head. Started the day off with eggs on toast. Had a football game in the afternoon which was very tough to get through as I felt my body crashing without the sugar. The only sugar I had was after the match in a protein shake and was well out of the way of one of my normal trigger foods so successfully managed to avoid these triggers throughout the day.

All in all, Day 1 has been hard but I'm glad to get through the first 24 hours. There was moments in there I made good choices and I'm proud of myself for Consciously making decisions about snack foods rather than reaching for snacks and treats without thinking first. 

My best advice after day 1 is making yourself accountable. I feel as though being open with people about cutting out sugar really is a game changer. If you fail you don't just let yourself down you let everybody else who knows your struggle down too. So tell people you are going to change so they can hold you responsible and prove to them you can do it.

I know the next few days won't be easy but I hope my body will start to back me up and give me the energy and mental toughness to get through.

First a bit of background on me.

I'm 24yo Male. At school and since I have left school I have been involved with competitive sports and have focused on a bit of bodybuilding at times. I have always felt a pressure to be in shape for sporting reasons and personal reasons. I have always known I have had a sweet tooth but I guess didn't know I was addicted until now. Im not sure how to pinpoint when it started but it definitely got worse with the ability to buy my own food after leaving school and getting a job and working shift work for energy etc. I have always had an athletic build and struggled to put on weight so overate good foods to put on weight, I guess these good foods have now turned into bad foods and I am at a point where I am not overweight or fat but I have definitely put on more fat than normal to the point where I want to lose it to be back to good shape. I have found this incredibly hard over the last few weeks with eating healthy as I find myself reaching for sweet food without even thinking about it and before I've known it I've scoffed myself with cakes and chocolate and feel terrible about myself. It has now blown to the point where I will buy chocolate without my fiancee knowing and eat whole blocks in a day. I can't stop at one or two pieces and have to keep going until it's all gone. At work we have a spread of food that is put on each Friday and I eat my share and then sneak in to the staffroom to eat any leftovers and keep sneaking to eat as the day goes on until there is no more. 

Anyway, I have decided I am going to try and curb my sugar addiction. I have told my fiancee about it (not the parts of buying blocks of chocolate behind her back or sneaking in to the staff room out of embarrassment) in the hope she will encourage me and keep me accountable for my actions. I will also try and keep you updated with any tips I have or what is working and any progress I make. It would be great if anyone sees this and wants to message me to challenge me or just join along with me. Reading the posts in this forum I can relate to almost all of them so hoping we can all get past it. I think if I fail I am going to make the consequence that I have to tell my fiancee about buying the chocolate bars behind her back and Everytime I fail after that I will tell another person I love about what's going on. 

If anyone has any suggestions as I go or tips, feel free to let me know. I appreciate any support and feedback.",1566534981.0

I come a long line of Type 2 diabetics with other health problems all affected by diet. Obesity, heart disease, stroke, etc.

Two years ago I walked away from my religion when I came out, and the excitement of coming out and dating was enough for me to go from 264 to 224 (@ 6'1""). My appetite completely disappeared - but that was due to the anxiety and stress of that huge change. Now, in a relationship, my world has settled down and being comfortable and loved has lead to me putting on some of that weight again.

I love food. Even when I've had enough, I feel the need to finish my plate or have dessert with each meal. I socially eat and drink too - that is what I've grown up seeing as being the way to socialize.

So I don‚Äôt really know where to post this on and found this sub.,4,cscoqr,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/cscoqr/so_i_dont_really_know_where_to_post_this_on_and/,0,"I am a 19f and I was and still mostly am an athlete my sport required me to cut a lot of weight in high school which honestly probably wasn‚Äôt the best for me considering I was already under weight due to genetics 5‚Äô5 120lbs which might not seem to bad but I am a very long girl. In order for me to reach my competition weight (106 lbs) I had to consume a super small amount of calories especially considering I would lose about 8-12 lbs every week bc after weigh ins I would sky rocket back up due to binge eating. Well fast forward to my freshman year of college where I was still underweight 5‚Äô6 113 lbs ( I think I weighed less bc I stopped cutting weight for the summer so my body  plateaued out) my first competition I had a serious knee injury and couldn‚Äôt walk for about three weeks and could not compete for another three months but was able to lift and light cardio I ended up weighing 140lbs not all bad weight some of it was muscle some of it was fat along with it and I didn‚Äôt mind bc I was bulking. Once I was able to compete I cut the weight down to 123 in about three weeks then cut it down to 116 in two weeks doing it all the wrong way barely eating over loading with cardio and dehydration. This is a terrible way to lose weight but it is the way most athletes in my sport do it bc of partly laziness and partly lack of knowledge. Later on after a great season at 116lbs I began to learn about how to properly fuel your body and cut weight from the hired level athletes I began training with. Fast forward again I haven‚Äôt competed in a few months due to a combination of no confidence, injury, and not being able to get weight off. My point of telling you all this is I feel like all those years of binge eating and cutting weight have destroyed my relationship with food I always want to eat it is so hard for me to control my eating no matter how hard I try food is always on my mind, I feel like I was deprived of it for so long I am trying to compensate. Cutting weight has also really hurt my self image I am not used to not have abs I used to have a perfect flat stomach now I can see my love handles and belly fat. My current weight is 136lbs at 5‚Äô6.5 I work out 5-6 times a week and many people say I am thing and in good shape yet I don‚Äôt not feel that way. I often make poor food choices and soon regret it judging myself, my will power, my appearance. I believe my lack of confidence comes from always priding my self in how much self discipline I had as a serious athlete. Cutting weight took away a normal relationship with food and really hurt my body image. I am writing this as a last resort I need help or at least someone who has experience the same thing. 

*WARNING*: don‚Äôt read if sensitive 
I have made myself throw up one time in my life for feeling fat and often think about doing it again but I don‚Äôt because I know the damage that can due to a body.

Sugar addiction,8,crrhxc,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/crrhxc/sugar_addiction/,12,"I am addicted to sugar (24 F) . Realized it a couple of years ago and last year promised myself that I will stop eating sugar because if I take only one bite of chocolate I can't just stop there, I have to eat it all.  I think I didn't realize I have a big problem before because I don't have any weight problem, I am 5 foot 9.5 (177cm) and weight around 138 lb (63kg), but lately I began to understand that it can have a bad influence on my health in future.

I will try to keep it short. I eat sugar on daily basis, I eat chocolate on daily basis, I have been doing it since I was a little kid, my house was always full of candy and sometimes I would eat enormous amount of it in a day. For example, in on day I would eat 4 popsicles, one big chocolate (around 90 gram), few small ones, would drink one big package of chocolate milk, and pancakes with nuttela. I still sometimes eat a whole bowl of nuttela (400 g I think) in one day. I have days when I ONLY eat sugar for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They are not that often but they happen.

I Want to stop!
But don't know how.
Ive tried too many times and failed each one of them. If I don't eat sugar during the day I become cranky and unhappy, like in that moment sugar is all I can think about and after I eat it I litteraly feel like a different better and more collected person, like I took my dose of drug and I become happy and calm again. 
Currently, the approximate dose of sugar I eat in a day is for example... I drink 2 cups of coffee a day in which I put normal amount of sugar, I will eat one chocolate (around 90g), probably some chocolate cookies (or half to full box sometimes) around the evening, and for breakfast I usually eat two croissants with chocolate.

My plan is to cut the dose of daily intake of sugar for the begging but it might sound a lot easier then what it really is for me (I litteraly feel like an drug addict but on sugar (don't mean to offend anyone)),  i really hope some of you might have few good advices for me on how to start this fight against sugar and how to deal with crisis and moments of weakness when they come.
It was so much easier for me to stop smoking than to eat sugar, so I really have a problem with this one.

Difference to so many of my previous efforts is mindset, I have really accepted that I have an issue with certain foods and it is better for me to completely abstain. 

Note: I have chosen not to name the things so as not to trigger others. I also find it helpful to not give those things space in my mind.",1564042917.0

Always had Food Addiction. Just found out.,5,cfu6q2,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/cfu6q2/always_had_food_addiction_just_found_out/,5,"I‚Äôve been obese since childhood, and had been told that I had Binge Eating Disorder about 5 years ago. I had been told that it was just anxiety causing the BED, and curbing anxiety would help with weight. But even when my anxiety is doing better, I still think about food all the time. Eating is the only thing I can think of that I really want to do. I explored all of the lying, spending and hiding I do with food with my new therapist and this food addiction diagnosis makes sense.

I have been trying to find a program to attend for food addiction specifically (I‚Äôm in the Cleveland area), but my insurance won‚Äôt cover it and I‚Äôm totally broke (the therapist is free through the county). What are some good resources to use if I can‚Äôt find a physical group to go to?

(It sucks that being totally broke doesn‚Äôt stop me from spending every cent I see on food instead of help. I‚Äôm employed, but in severe debt...mostly from food.)",1563676524.0

"Hi, new here",10,ca3v95,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/ca3v95/hi_new_here/,8,"So here goes. Food addiction is the cause of all my health problems. I'm overweight, I have depression and anxiety, I have high blood pressure, and I have type 2 diabetes which creates more problems like nerve pain/damage, kidney damage, and slow healing wounds. I used to weigh over 500 lbs and I lost 100 of those lbs and have been hovering at the same weight for 9 years. I always fluctuate about 10 lbs over or below, but my weight has been the same. I've virtually given up all sweets, regular soft drinks, and skip on desserts. I do occasionally still drink diet soda or La Croix. I do have vegetables and fruit in my diet. I don't think my problem is the kind of foods I eat. It's how much I eat. I don't just eat some cantaloupe slices when I'm craving sweets, I'll eat the whole cantaloupe. I don't eat a serving of vegetable/chicken stirfry, I'll eat the whole wok. And if I treat myself to pizza, I can't just have 1 slice, I'll have the whole thing. I just have this hunger that doesn't stop, even when I'm physically full. I'm seemingly incapable of leaving leftovers or preparing meals ahead of time. I eat till there's nothing left to eat. And sometimes I'll go out of my way to buy more food if I'm still hungry.

&#x200B;

My whole life I've been this way. My mother said that as a baby I went through formula like crazy (I was a c-section birth and I couldn't breastfeed) and I slowly gained weight since toddlerhood. I went through some old medical records and I was 20 lbs overweight at the age of 3. I was never a skinny kid. Every year I seemed to gain 20 lbs until I hit 500 in my early 20s. I am 30 now. I'm already feeling the damage from my eating habits. I already went through what felt like 3 or 4 wake up calls. Sometimes I fix things around. 2 years ago, I lost feeling in my feet. I got scared and changed my diet for 3 months. I lowered my A1C and lost 20 lbs. The feeling in my feet returned. My doctors said that the nerve damage might have been minimal so if I keep eating healthier, I could get all nerve function back. But then I went through some relationship crap. And I started eating the same way again and got back to where I was. The numbness returned. And at that point I just learned to live with numb feet. Last December, I had a life threatening infection that was complicated from high blood sugar from diabetes. I was hospitalized for 3 days and was in pain. I changed things only slightly. There were weeks where I did good and other weeks where I didn't do so well. It's a constant and daily struggle. And here I am, 6 months later, full and feeling like crap after an eating binge. And I still want to eat more.",1562480894.0
Abstinence = insomnia... help!,11,c8h5hz,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/c8h5hz/abstinence_insomnia_help/,9,"I am 4 days into abstaining from wheat and sugar. It's something that I really need to do and is a long time coming. I've really come to accept that I have a problem with these foods. 
However, whenever I start eating low carb my sleep goes to sh*t!
As background, I have suffered from insomnia all my life and up until 2 months I have managed it without medication. I am now on medication which mostly works, except when I go low carb. 
I have done keto before and was really rigid (ie really watched my veg intake) and had the same issue, but this time I'm going gentler and eating lots of veg so my carb intake, while still being low, is not as low as keto.
Any thoughts or similar experiences?

Food addiction has ruined my body and health,25,c6jl98,FoodAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/c6jl98/food_addiction_has_ruined_my_body_and_health/,8,"At 18 I moved out of home and weighed a pretty average 69kg. I was never skinny, but I was healthy. The stress of uni, being very low income and living far away from home triggered my chronic illness that caused me to be mostly bedbound and extremely depressed. To make myself feel better I just ate. All the time. Anything I could. 

I‚Äôm now 21 and weigh 110kgs. I have stretch marks and saggy skin. I‚Äôm going to need plastic surgery to fix the parts I‚Äôve ruined. I can only shop at plus sized stores. I‚Äôm too heavy for normal rides. My feet hurt all the time. I‚Äôm tired after 5 minutes of walking.

I don‚Äôt know how to eat. I don‚Äôt just binge - my eating patterns are totally utterly fucked up. My portions are at least 2x the size they should be. If I don‚Äôt eat until I feel sick I actually feel panicked, like I‚Äôve been deprived of something. I‚Äôm protective over food and will hoard snacks, junk, whatever I can. I hate sharing, I hide ‚Äúgood food‚Äù from my partner and freak out if he touches it. My taste buds are totally screwed and it it isn‚Äôt insanely salty, sweet, fried or oily than it actually makes me feel nauseous.

Has anyone come back from this? Has anyone fixed their habits, changed their life? How is it all these people around me have naturally easy relationships with food and it makes me fucking crazy?
