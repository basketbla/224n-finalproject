Ask Me! 1 Year Recovery,6,swyp5a,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/swyp5a/ask_me_1_year_recovery/,1,"I'm 1 year in recovery without help. I remember asking for a therapist twice and both times being denied. At the beginning of my disorder (beforw i got bad) i was actually told by an ed specialist that i was ""too fat' to have an ed and it relly fucked me up. I actually wound up recovering on my own through radical self love. I actually work at ra restaurant, which I never thought would be possible!!! Lots of free food. I work at a Japanese restaurant so mix of healthy sushi and unhealthy fried rice and I get most of my meals from there. I eat at the very least two hearty meals per day. I turned the obsession aspect into an obsession for cooking, and I make things like: avocado toast, fried rice with egg, pasta Primavera, etc. I've grown a fondness for life despite the past of self-hatred.

Will my hair ever grow back? Feeling very discouraged,5,ssq0j7,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/ssq0j7/will_my_hair_ever_grow_back_feeling_very/,6,"Hi guys! I’m a 19F who has had anorexia for a year. I have been recovering for the last 3 months. I have restored my weight and eat 2000 cals per day. 

About 6-7 months into anorexia, I started to see clumps of hair come out. Large chunks of hair from sections of my scalp would fall out. Once I started to enter recovery, the biggest difference I noticed is that less hair falls out. However, my scalp is still bare and “naked” in places where hair used to be. Before my ed, I used to have thick wavy hair and a lot of it too. Now, even after being in recovery for 3 months and the shredding stopping, my hair is thin and there is not much of it. I’m concerned that the hairs that fell out will not grow back and my hair will remain weak, and thin. 

For those of you who have recovered or know someone who has recovered: 

1. Did you grow back your hair to what it looked like before (thicker, healthy)?
2. What did you do to support the growth (diet, vitamins, oils etc)?
3. Will my hair grow back or is this demage permanent? 


Please feel to share your thoughts and any advice. My hair was my favourite feature and I’m very anxious about if I will get it back.",1644886263.0

I do intermittent fasting 5 days a week. I don't eat between 8-12. the reason behind this is to be able to identify when Im hungry vs when I'm bored. I don't think it's affecting my mental health negatively. I used to think about food all the time but now it's only on my mind a few minutes before mealtime. I feel much better.

2 instant oatmeal (plain) packs 

Banana

Coffee with soy milk

LUNCH (every day)

Brown or white rice (1-1.5 cups)  
Lots of sauteed broccoli, cauliflower, tofu, and peas. (or tempeh)

Carrots and about 1/3 cup of hummus

More Coffee and soy milk (I like a lot of milk in my coffee)

Dinner 

Same as lunch

Dessert (I have every night since I fast in the morning)

About 1-1.5 cups of cereal with banana, peanut butter, and soy milk. On the weekends I have dark chocolate with this (One small bar - 160 cals)

Idk what I’m looking for here...,5,somg6s,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/somg6s/idk_what_im_looking_for_here/,0,"About 5 years ago I started struggling with ED, I was never formally diagnosed as my therapist wasn’t very professional and seemed to ignore my symptoms. She was focussed on my anxiety and depression more so, and I think my parents/adults around me just wanted me to keep it to myself. I lied my way out of any diagnosis, and just didn’t see a doctor or bring it up to anyone, so my issues were greatly ignored. 

I had intense problems for a year, the typical symptoms we all know about, I won’t mention because I don’t want to upset or trigger anyone. Afterwards, it lessened but I still struggled a lot for a long time. 

Two years ago, 2020, it started up pretty rough again, I had moved out on my own and couldn’t afford much food so I spiralled and was very sick again. Once I got a job and my partner moved in with me, it did get better.

Now, I’m starting to get worried. I weigh the most I ever have, I can see it and I know other people can do. For a while, I’ve been happy with it, but it’s getting harder. Starting to hate how I look, having trouble finding clothes I feel okay in... 

Idk really what to do. I should be honest with my partner, probably, but I’m not sure if they’d take it seriously. I have too much anxiety to see a professional, I’ve never really seen a doctor on my own before. Last time I “recovered” is because I was too anxious that I’d need to go to a hospital, I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.

I have struggled with starving myself since I was 16, 7 years ago, along with my severe depression, out of hatred for and disgust in myself. A year ago I was committed for being suicidal and while I was there I admitted for the first time about my starving. The doctor didn’t believe me and just told me if I was trying to lose weight, what healthy food to eat. I kept trying to explain that I physically could not bring myself to eat anything and he didn’t listened. My friend had started to notice I would never eat when we went out, and she was the only one that was ever concerned. After months of this period of starving, I had been passing out regularly and my hair was falling out constantly. I had to move for my job and away from my friend, but I tried so hard to improve my mental health. Not much changed but I put so much effort in to forcing myself to drink a smoothie in the morning packed with vegetables and fruit, and make myself eat something for dinner. I made goals more about fitting in to an airplane seat, being able to go to six flags, etc. instead of daily appearance based goals. Gradually I started to get better and am not as stressed and depressed about eating, and have been consistent. 

Since working on recovering, I started losing weight I could never when I wasn’t eating. This morning I hit a weight that I hadn’t seen in so long (not sharing numbers). It is a huge accomplishment for anyone and I am so excited to finally reach it.

There, I 'went through weight restoration, eating only the foods I'm comfortable with (in extremely high amounts, if needed) and training to increase muscle mass. The amount I had to eat to gain weight increased but eventually it kind of reached a plateau. Since I was discharged, my weight has been kind of fluctuating around the medical ''goal'', and I make small adjustments to my eating to stay on track. Recently, I have accidentally lost a little bit and increased in order to gain weight again. This worked for two weeks, but in the last week I suddenly lost weight very quickly for no reason. I decided to increase again and adjust my strength training to better support hypertrophy. But I don't feel like I can change even more if it should be needed.

Discussion: Should regular exercise be part of ED treatment?,2,s582z8,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/s582z8/discussion_should_regular_exercise_be_part_of_ed/,1,"(Sorry if this isn't the purpose of this sub or if it's too triggering, just delete this post then)
Recently, I thought about this a lot and I would like to hear others' thoughts on this. Should regular exercise be offered to people in ED treatment (residential, intensive outpatient or FBT, especially children or adolescent patients)? If yes, what kind and how much? Would there be the need for something else to accompany exercise sessions?

In my opinion, exercise should be included in treatment plans. Obviously, regular movement can improve mood, anxiety and even increase appetite a little bit (relevant if the patient requires weight restoration). In the context of body-image related disorders (BED, BN, AN, others), some forms of planned exercise could potentially help form trust in one's body. Also, it prepares patients for ''real life'', where they'll see others doing sports or hear others praising physical activity. If weight restoration is needed, strength training could increase muscle gain and lost strength, whereas BED and BN patients could also use reasonable amounts aerobic exercise as an element of a controlled weight loss program (if  needed).
Regardless of who is treated, physical activity should be enjoyable and therapeutic, and patients should be invited, not pressured to participate.

This is partly my fault because every time my mum tried to get me to eat something i just flat out refused. 

now i’m in a much better headspace and i actually want to recover, ive been asking my mum to change things in my meal plan and she just flat out says no or this isn’t the time to talk about this. at this point it feels like she is my eating disorder. When i ask to eat something different she asks me is it equivalent and then i ask her if she means calories and if she says yes then i find something equivalent. But then when i tell her she changes her mind and says no you can’t have that there’s so many different things that aren’t equivalent and things that you’re missing out on. 

It’s like she wants me to track calories and every little thing. It’s exhausting because i’m stuck not being allowed to recover when i’m more than ready to. 

I know it is probably just as scary for her as it is for me to change things because she has had to take such close care of me for so long but i don’t know how to get her to understand that i’m ready to recover properly, and no matter what i say she just shuts me down. she also says things like i don’t want this to be the rest of your life but then i use that on her to ask to eat something else and she says no. i’m so frustrated because i want to move on with my life but i can’t, she’s stopping me.",1641791474.0

And about a year ago when I started recovery and also started at at new school. At the new school I got a new friend, and after some time I was going to sleep over at here house. Neither of my friend or her parents new about my ed, but I decided not to tell them since I was doing really well in recovery and was really determined to recover. We were having dinner at her house, and I would say that the dinner itself went great. You should keep in mind that my friend is someone that doesn’t eat a lot, but I decided to not eat less than her (it was hard, but like I said I was really determined to recover) and eat a healthy amount. But after the dinner, her mom said to me: “I’m so glad that we have finally had a guest over that eats so much, it makes me happy to see that someone eats more then they need.” And like I know that the intention of that comment wasn’t meant to be harmful in anyway, but it made me relapse for a little while.

In the end it probably would have been a good idea to tell them about my ed before dinner so that they wouldn’t comment on the amount of food I was eating or anything like that, but I think you should never say to someone that they eat more than they need or comment on the amount (except if you’re worried for them of course, but then you should talk to them in private and not comment in front of everyone at the dinner table). 

Have you guys have anything similar happened to you? Like a comment that wasn’t meant to be harmful, but hurt you?

Note: I’m sorry if my english is bad and if there is any writing mistakes, but english isn’t my first language. I’m also doing very well in recovery and I don’t think that comment would upset me as much today.",1640483081.0

Life long damage?,6,rguf7y,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/rguf7y/life_long_damage/,3,"Hello lovely’s! I’ve been in recovery for 3 1/2 years now from anorexia, it’s been up and down but I have maintained a way heavier weight than I ever thought I could and at one point had total food freedom. I say at one point because my health has remained poor despite gaining and maintaining a 60 pound point weight gain for more than a year (20-30 pounds overshoot). The first year of my recovery was pretty traumatic, I did everything alone acting as my dietician, therapist, and doctor… needless to say that was pretty terrible and not an overwhelmingly positive experience, I thankfully went to treatment 10 months in and after many of my symptoms went away for a year! Before I began to recover I developed chronic stomach problems, was binging everyday (never had I experienced binging like that), swelling of hands, feet, and legs, chronically bloated, never satiated, in pain and chronically fatigued. I knew I would have to recover or things being in a compromised state (underweight and in a cycle of binge, overexercise, and restrict) continue to worsen and so when I chose recovery I really felt it would heal my body. I still hold out for hope because there have been periods where my chronic illness has improved in the last 3 years. I don’t know what to do, I really do feel like I fucked my body up for good sometimes and carry so much shame and remorse. I’m wondering if anyone has experience dealing with persistent health problems from their Ed? I will always hold out for hope but this shit is exhausting especially because I don’t have a diagnosis of one condition but have many innocuous things like IBS, tonsil stones, dermatitis, chronic fatigue, acne, gut problems out the whazoo, rosacea, hair thinning, nails are still weak af, potentially ovarian cysts, arthritis, chronic pain. It may not seem like anything severe but in combination it is a very painful and stressful life I live. I think the stress of recovery done mostly alone made healing a lot worse and Definetly feel at this point semi strong in my recovery—not gonna be underweight ever again probably and my body won’t let me—but since my gut is fucked idk what I can eat so I have to be obsessive but I do still feel very ashamed about having gained SO much weight in recovery, especially because it seemingly didn’t cure my health problems like I thought it would.",1639556907.0

I really just have a few bits of juicy bs to get off my mind, maybe posting it here could help a little. 
After ""recovering"" from a restrictive disorder, I gained weight and had a mindset that was a lot more functional. I am not going to mention mumbers but I haven't had a single bite I haven't tracked and counted for about 3 years. I have been counting since I was 14. After that came another low, lost period again, and then boom, I decided to check what other disorder we got in the mix and developed a binge habit. Then right on top of the binge habit came the realisation that I can get rid of the dinner of 4 I have just consumed via toilet. What a fucking breakthrough, it set me up for a bulimia-ish period. I always end my binges with a fresh new plan to get better. To eat healthier. To maintain my weight, which is perfectly healthy. To make peace with food, to banish it from my thoughts. I don't want to wake up and calculate my day in my head. I don't want to starve an entire day before and after a night of heavy drinking, only to end up binging. I want to get my energy back, my thoughts back. I really really wish, from the bottom of my heart, that every single person who struggles with eating related problems manages to find a way to roundhouse kick that shit. It is unbeleivably hard to accept that you are no longer ""skinny"". You don't get the comments or the high from restricting. You no longer have the safe little mental palace built of lies and numbers and low calorie recipes. Or maybe it isn't like that for you. Maybe you are struggling because your only solace is food, maybe you are binging beacuse your Palace is made of hatred towards yourself. 
All I can say, that this entire system of addiction, fear, safety and hatred we built around food is only in our minds. Guys, we have no idea how many treasures this world holds once we leave the fucking mental palace and turn towards life, not EDs.

Is 2-3 lbs per week gained safe for eating disorder recovery?,4,r7ku5n,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/r7ku5n/is_23_lbs_per_week_gained_safe_for_eating/,4,"I started my recovery about 3 weeks ago at 79 and aimed for 0.5 lbs per week with the calorie calculator, but actually gained 1-2 lbs per week.

Do you think it is safe for me to increase my calorie intake for 2 lbs per week of weight gain? I just want to make sure I am gaining weight safely. And not over stressing my body.

And a lot of the healthy coping habits I had when I was in ED ( I know this sounds kind of odd) but with stress I would journal or meditate (when in ED) and then when I started gaining weight I just started eating when I was stressed... which is fine... but it definitely made my depression worse (or maybe I just was still sad and now hated my body again)... I think... regardless I am trying to maintain my weight but also make some better life choices as I am now pre diabetic and have a family history of diabetes, but it feels like a slippery slope ... And even though I did all this to get my period back it is still really irregular 

I guess I am getting to a point where there are a lot of things that are uncertain in my life at the moment and I really just want to slip back into that simplicity of mind.

To me, every number that is only a little larger than my lowest weight feels like my highest. 117 is no longer 117, because 117 is pretty close to 120, and 120 is pretty much 140, which is almost 145. In my mind I know that I am below my bmi and am close to being at a normal weight, but parts of me still believe that ""I'm big"" and ""I can't do what I did today, tomorrow"". I need to be able to stop these intrusive thoughts. The only reason I stepped on the scale was because prior to my shower needing to be fixed, I hadn't stepped on the scale for a month or so.

Please tell me if you have felt this way. Or if anything that I am saying is relatable. I am reaching out because I am new to recovery, please let me feel welcomed to this community.",1635213787.0

I'm only at the beginning,6,qeua8s,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/qeua8s/im_only_at_the_beginning/,0,"HUGE TW


Honestly I'm quite emotional right now. I developed anorexia when I was extremely young, I think I was 12 or 13. I never got down to a dangerously low weight, I've always maintained a thoroughly average weight, but that's what I feel like has been my downfall, because nobody ever noticed that I've been suffering all this time. The thoughts always stayed in the back of my head.

Over the years I've tried countless diets and weight loss programs, I've made plans to only eat certain foods and do certain excercises and restrict this and that. 

Going vegan when I was 18 helped me a lot. I felt like I was eating good nourishing food and that was the first time when I was truly okay with eating ""junk"" foods once in a while.
However when the weight gain (nothing huge, like 5 pounds at the most) inevitably started, I couldn't handle it and went right back to my dieting mindset.

I just found some of my old journals from last year where I wrote my countless weight loss plans in. And it's so heartbreaking.
On one page, one of the rules I wrote down was ""eat when you're hungry"" and I just got so happy when I read that but then the last one was ""don't eat after 6pm"". I was so close! Almost there!

I'm honestly doing better than I have in years eating wise. It's just so hard to realise how many years I wasted hating my body.",1635088967.0

&#x200B;

I'm a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania, and my Masters thesis is focused on developing a product, tool, or solution to help those recovering from eating disorders.

&#x200B;

As part of the initial research, we've developed a completely anonymous survey meant to source stories from those in all stages of their journey. We're hoping to use these insights to get a better sense of what could be helpful to those living with EDs or are in recovery.

"my story, advice?",1,qczx8p,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/qczx8p/my_story_advice/,0,"i’d like to say back in February/March was when my eating got bad. I had just got out of a very bad relationship which led to me barely caring about myself. I basically used to binge eat a lot of fast food and unhealthy stuff. It wasn’t until August where it backfired. I had severe heartburn and temporary acid reflux causing me to be very restrictive. My doctor noticed the weight drop from when I recovered from that and obviously raised the concern about my old ed relapsing ( I used to be very restrictive in the past years). my girlfriend was in the room with me when that was mentioned so basically ever since the end of August, I have been recovering with the help of her and also some friends. It’s been about 2 months. The first month was easy for me only because I was determined and also because my metabolism wasn’t able to keep up with me. Little detail, I have a fast metabolism which is what triggers the spiraling affect of my ed mostly because I will give up with trying. Now that I am in the second month, it is getting hard again. My metabolism has definitely caught up with me. Eating 3 meals a day with a couple healthy snacks doesn’t exactly do much. It’ll stabilize my weight but it doesn’t go up. The biggest thing that interferes though is that I work in the performing arts, specifically dance. I do eat healthy meals for the main 3 which works fine. The issue usually is between lunch and dinner. I am back to full out working and rehearsing things, so it’s not that easy to eat something then go back to what I was doing because it would be easy to make myself sick. I’m not sure if anybody else works a job like that, but if anybody has ideas or advice of what I could eat during that time period that also helps me get more calories, feel free to comment. It’s been beating me up a little bit mentally because I want to be able to get ahead of my metabolism since I’ve spent years letting it cause me to be underweight for years. Even if you have any tips to naturally slow it down that’ll be nice. 

One last thing I’m curious about, when does your hair stop falling out significantly? it’s not as bad as it was in the beginning but it’s still there. I know my stress levels did play a role not long ago but is there like a way to fix it or does it just fix itself on its own?",1634845924.0

10 years in Recovery,7,qbx98t,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/qbx98t/10_years_in_recovery/,0,"It’s been so long feeling free. Sometimes I feel trapped and scared and engage, but I catch myself and I do better because I know better. I don’t want anyone to think it isn’t possible to recover. I’m not there yet but I see hope in doing and being so. Ive never felt more free from my ED, most days it feels so so far away from my minds it’s as if it never happened. But it did. 10 years in recovery, 10 years since my first step towards fixing, 10 years I admitted myself into treatment. My family didn’t help me, my friends didn’t help me, it was all self driven admittance because I finally realized I could be saved. It was so scary, for so long. No one in my life had ever heard of anyone going to treatment for their ED, or at least no one ever talked about it. My teachers were so confused with what to do but I guided them even through my mania. I guided everyone through this on top of doing it for myself. It was so uncomfortable, so emotionally exhausting and physically too. I never thought I’d get out of feeling so shitty, full of anxiety and anger. But I stuck with treatment, I stuck with making sure I was taking accountability and not rewarding myself for bad behavior. I made sure that I was eating and sticking to my meal plan. No one policed me, no one was looking out for me so I did it myself, going to therapy, seeing my nutritionist and doctor very frequently to track my progress, taking my meds and writing my thoughts. It’s been and was hard. Lots of times I lapsed, so many times. But I have yet to relapse and it’s also my biggest fear. I never want to be as deprived as I once was, lifeless and mean and horrible. Seeing death was the wake up call for me. Living life in a wheelchair was absolutely rock bottom and I never want to be her ever again, looking at yourself from an outside perspective really helped me. I love life, I love enjoying life. 
At this point, I haven’t had or owned a scale in 7 years. I haven’t counted a single calorie in 2 years. I haven’t abused laxatives/exercise in 6 years. I haven’t been on a diet in 4 years. And I feel so so so good most days. I feel free, I feel so normal and looking at my old journals are so scary that I fight everyday as hard as I can. I looked at my old ED tumblr and I didn’t even recognize my posts, I don’t even know that person anymore and it feels so good. I indulge in food, I enjoy my food, I sit with my feelings and the fullness and I love it. I’ve never felt days like this until now.
No one will probably read this but I really needed to reassure myself tonight after a very hard month that I’m still in this and I’m still dedicated to being better. I love life, I love recovery no matter how many times I scream and cry about it. It’s possible and I hope other people can find their reasons to keep going because all you need is one, mine was art.",1634723550.0

Internship versus health,2,qaiqa7,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/qaiqa7/internship_versus_health/,2,"I just graduated college in the spring and was able to attain an internship with my state’s Congressional office. However, I have been dealing with a severe eating disorder for 11 years (which has gotten worse with age). Prior to the internship, I was in the hospital. I ended up having to work from home, thanks to an incredibly understanding office. However, I want to work in person, which is how I started the internship. I have not disclosed the eating disorder due to mental health stigma, but they are aware that I was in the hospital and have kidney issues (part of why I was hospitalized). 

My conundrum is this: I want this opportunity. Do I want to work at this office in the future? Eh, maybe not. But it’s fabulous for my resume, gives me a good connection, and I like to stick out what I start. However, by continuing to work, I am finding it impossible to recover and have been in a relapse for reasons secondary to this internship, but the internship is like that token thing that’s enabling me to stay in relapse. 

I want to get healthy so bad. But I want this internship. I also want to lose some of the weight I gained and know that if I continue working, I will. With a month and a half left, do I ride it out or throw in the towel?

I’ve been hospitalized twice and gone through 3 eating disorder rehabilitation. I now have permanent damage done to my gastrointestinal system because of my eating disorder. Everyone that’s in my life is extremely aware of the fact I’m in recovery (or at least try to be) At this point in my life I’m very good at communicating and asking for help. I do not want to have an eating disorder anymore. I want recovery so badly but it seems so far away. 

I feel out of control with every aspect of food, body image, body movement. Everything is centered around body image and food. I constantly feel like im over eating/binge eating. I have my eating disorder voice screaming at me to restrict and purge. I have the urge to over exercise. I desperately want to cut out ""bad"" foods. If I wasn't watched and made sure to eat I would 100% not eat. If I didn't live with my boyfriend I would be engaging all day every day. I don't know how to handle these feelings. He is struggling himself to eat (he doesn’t have an eating disorder: Its his depression thats making it very difficult to get the motivation to make food. He tells me it’s too much of ""chore"".) He eats maybe one full meal a day, if that. However it's becoming a problem now. Even when I buy us food he won't finish it. Ex: he couldn't finish a 6"" subway. And he didn't eat for the rest of the day. 
He's completely aware that by him not eating it triggers me. I don’t want to force him to eat because he’s mentioned he feels physically ill while eating (most likely due to not eating. His body just isn't use to the food.) but it’s making me feel so much worse. 
I want to be really mad at my boyfriend for not eating because it makes it like a thousand times harder for me to eat - I know that's selfish. i feel really conflicted and I'm not sure how to fix it.

since ski season ended i have slowly been gaining weight and also drinking more which it’s the only way i can eat without restriction. i am at a point where it is so clear to me how miserable my eating disorder makes me. 
i am constantly depressed and all i can think about is all of the life i am wasting out on and wish so badly that i could be normal but i am so fucking terrified to recover. i would rather not be alive than face recovery is pretty much how i feel. i want to be alive but not as myself.

Loss of jawline after weight restoration?,3,pa02n0,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/pa02n0/loss_of_jawline_after_weight_restoration/,0,"Salutations,

I've been meaning to put forth this inquiry for long now as the effects described bellow have been nagging me to the core for the past year.

Context:
2017 - 2018 academic year, first ANA case;
2018 summer, recovery from ANA;
2019 - 2020 academic year, second ANA case;
2020 summer, recovery from second ANA;
2021 winter, three-month BN case;

Since my first recovery in 2018, I've had enlarged submandibular (located under the jaw) salivary glands that haven't shrunk even till today. I do not feel pain, it is the case that their presence aesthetically unpleasant. 
I could live with them, until last year's autumn, when I gained back to my pre-2017 weight and since then I'm devoured by the hatred that has become the lack of a jawline. I used to have it even with the weight that I am at currently. It's been five months since often purging has seized (with infrequent purges happening twice a month now in worst cases) and I am confused and troubled.

My question is:
What has happened here with the chin-jawline area? Have I messed up my face physiology and will now have a double chin for the rest of the time, where there used to not be one? Or is this still the aftermath of BN recovery (though, then I'm troubled by the little time that I had purged and whether that had such a profound impact for so long)?

Today my boyfriend and I went to a clothing store, since recovering I don't have a ton of pants that fit comfortably, and he also needed new pants. I found a pair I liked, but felt as if the size was super small, even though the number felt too big. So, for the first time in a long time I went into the fitting room. I was stressed, as they're just not a good place for me. But I was pleasantly surprised when the pants fit me perfectly. I was even a little excited and didn't bother to shop anymore, as I was happy to have had that kind of luck right away. 

We go to check out and that's where it all went to hell. We're cashing out and the cashier asked us how far along I was. I literally felt my heart drop to my heels. My boyfriend spoke for me, but the second we stepped out into the parking lot I started crying and am still really upset.

Anyway, peanut butter was only added to my plan maybe a week ago. I’ve already gone through THREE FULL JARS. THREE. It’s like my body and brain are just screaming at me to eat it. I’m binging on it nonstop, and I’m NEVER full. 

And you know what’s weird, I don’t crave the same foods I would typically b/p on. It’s like none of those matter anymore. I can have my regular meals and I still want that peanut butter (and sometimes whipped cream). It’s like my brain knows I can’t purge this, it’s going to stay down, and that it’s craving fat. 

I’ve been reading recovery blogs where many people are saying this is totally normal, but it’s not stopping me from feeling like shit, and feeling so frustrated. Has this happened to anyone else? Any advice? Does it go away? I can’t eat this much peanut butter regularly.",1627511234.0

"Warning: Big Rant/Vent Sesh because I'm triggered af. CW: numbers in relation to kcal, exercise behaviours",7,omeio5,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/omeio5/warning_big_rantvent_sesh_because_im_triggered_af/,0,"Hi! Massive apologies in advance for this rant, I'm very panicky and I just needed to rant in a space where people will understand that I'm aware its irrational and makes no sense but also can't think a different way right now, so I could calm down and sort myself out lol

So I'm trying to recover after a massive lockdown triggered relapse last year, and I WAS doing really well. But I'm also moving country and just got put in a strict mandated isolation facility which is fine ofc, I knew what I was getting into, and I made sure I did loads of research and had a plan to cope because if anything could relapse me, locked in a small room with limited exercise opportunity and no control over my food is a def risk. The plan has a few aspects but really hinged on me renting a crosstrainer for my hotel room, which the website for these facilities said was allowed and I found a rental that would do it.

Facility rundown - I got a menu and was able to select foods for the next two weeks. I chose the healthiest lightest options and opted out of desserts. I calculated the first two days as best I could and even then I'd say we're looking at \~2000kcal a day. My MAINTENANCE when I am ACTIVE (locked in a hotel room so not so much here...) is 1800. So ofc I'm freaked out and made a plan to obvs just eat certain bits, leave things like rice etc out. I'm allowed half an hour outside a day but I am not allowed to run. My room is small and I can fit the xtrainer and could slide it aside to do insanity but cant really run in here or get meaningful walking pace. 

(Note here.. I have behaviours associated with exercise. I workout obsessively but my brain refuses to count anything as calories burned UNLESS IT IS A CROSSTRAINER OR A TREADMILL. Like I can literally run for an hour outside but if I'm not on a machine no matter how much I consciously KNOW I burned calories, my brain will just.. nope. Not on a machine, doesn't count. 0 calories burned do an hour on the treadmill/xtrainer). 

Treadmills I lkterally have to use for 90-120 minutes before my brain counts it but for reasons unknown to me as to why this is a thing, x trainer I can use two lots of 30 mins in a day and I'm fine. So my plan so I could eat was: yoga am, 30 min xtrainer heavy cardio am, shaun t insanity workout, and then just ''walk'' gently with no resistance on the xtrainer all day while watching tv or whatever so I'm in motion. then 30 min cardio again before bed. 

Hotel just denied me the xtrainer. I was so confused, website said it was allowed and they've just turned around and said I can't have it. What really pisses me off here is I had a welfare meeting on arrival where I was very clear about my issues and concerns and specified I was hiring a xtrainer and the nurses were like 'yep thats fine keep us updated on how you're doing'. So this ofc just sent me into complete panic mode. Now they've said I can hire an exercycle. Obviously I have immediately changed my order and I won't hear back till tomorrow if they have one available and I'm really hoping they do but if they don't I'm fucked. Even if they do my stupid ed brain which is now in total overdrive will refuse to consider it as calories burned and the only option I can see is to call the kitchen staff and ask them to not send me any food.. or just not open my door to get any or chuck it all or don't eat it and spend all day every day doing fuckin insanity videos and cycling as fast as I can on a bike.

I'm just straight up freaking out at this point, I know once I calm down I can reassess and I'll call the nurse to talk about what to do but I really needed to get it out, sorry guys. Thank you for .. just having this space for me to panic so I can calm down and actually go deal with it haha. Ugh, wish me luck, this is going to be a hard 2 weeks",1626562164.0
Identity and who I am. Who am I if I'm not skinny,19,olsnz7,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/olsnz7/identity_and_who_i_am_who_am_i_if_im_not_skinny/,3,"I feel so shallow to care so much about how I look. If I was alone and the only person left in the world it would be so easy. As a former long distance runner and skinny my entire life I feel like being skinny is my identity. When I gained weight in college I immediately thought about it all the time and felt worthless. How do I let this go? How do I not care what other people think? 

I know my worth is in my kindness, my actions, how I treat others and myself. My worth isn't the way I look yet it matters so much to me. I keep thinking that if I'm not skinny people won't like me. Obviously that's not true and I know that, but gaining weight is harder in actual practice. 

I think I need to work on my self worth. I don't think I matter much at all for some reason. When someone likes me I get scared because I don't even like myself I think. I have a deep rooted sense of shame and feeling like I'm never enough. I'm not quite sure where that stemmed from.

I would never admit to my friends and family that I had/ have a eating disorder. It's just so embarrassing to not be able to do such a primitive behavior. 

It's been less than a year and I'm going to get through it. I know I am capable. I've done hard things. I commit myself when I want to see results. The results I'm looking for is zero control over what I eat. I want food to become unconscious for me. I want to eat to eat. No deeper meaning nothing. Just food. A few billion people do it every day. I can do it just as well. 

Well, this was a great time. I usual write this out in my journal but I'm posting it on here spontaneously. If anyone relates, please comment.",1626477911.0

Ever since seeing my mom make jabs at my sister who has BED due to my parents somewhat abandoning her (not really but in a sense) to take care of my health issues as a baby. She gives her a side eye and says “ you don’t need that” when she gets more food than her. She constantly says she’s being lazy, and always encourages her when she wants to diet ( which results in relaps) after being shown a video in school which vilified obesity I developed anorexia thinking that there was obviously something horrible about weight gain. I’ve since gained all that weight back and then some because I’m still getting taller and... you know, growing. 

But the problem is my moms newest thing. She’s so exited about keto. She just bought a ton of new keto safe foods, and guilted my sister into joining her. She’s been eating cereal bread rice fruit, bc “ diet starts Sunday”. But the whole thing is SOOO triggering. Restricting food groups was a big part of my ED and I’ve felt in an ok place recently. But this has completely blown up my head. I’ve tried to talk to her about how competitive EDs are but she always responds by saying “ our situations aren’t the same” and “ your sister WANTs to lose weight she’s not happy” which further engravings the Weight is bad thought in the back of my head. 
And besides that I KNOW my sister, we are very close. I haven’t said anything to her bc she seems to have a bit of hope in it. But I know it won’t last for her... that’s not how you cure BED.

Hey, does anyone have advice on how to recover from your ED while living in a house with a restricted kitchen? 

My grandmother has really bad untreated ocd and polices the kitchen and will scream at anyone who ""makes a mess"" in her kitchen. The only time anyone is allowed in the kitchen is when my mom cooks dinner and she is only allowed to cook what my grandparents want. I have been struggling to eat for the past 6 months, 4 and a half of those months I lived on my own but now I am back living at home. I thought it would be better cause someone else was cooking but since my mom only cooks what my grandparents tell her to it's been even harder to force myselfto eat. All my grandparents wants to eat is usually really heavy foods (pizzas, pasta, fried/breaded foods, beans, tacos) that I can't make myself eat. 

I am a adult with my own money but I can't drive so can't shop for food myself or go out and get something. The one time I tries to use doordash to order something I was yelled at for ""being ungrateful and rude"" because I didn't order everyone food. 

If I lose anymore weight my doctor will make me go to treatment and I don't have the money for that. And not only that, but I also promised my girlfriend I would start eating again and I really want to keep that promise it's just so hard when I can't even go into my own kitchen without getting screamed at

I really don't know what to do at this point.",1626210975.0

I have been noticing more and more over the years ADHD symptoms and how much things affect my life. Open to whatever she says, but I'd say itsa likely diagnosis, which may mean certain meds. As far as I know, these meds can repress appetite and therefore are not given as easily to those with restrictive eating tendencies. 
I don't have my first appointment until October (covid wait times I guess) and I have been working on recovery for the last few months. I have my struggles but I think I'm doing well. I'm focusing on health and nourishment and whilst I'm scared I'm also very excited and determined.

 I'm skinny but I've gained like 15 pounds in the last 4 months and I think I gained 10 within a month and a half and it worries me. I used to basically starve myself because I was too depressed to eat and in the past few months I've started eating more which I would assume accounts for the weight gain but it terrifies me how quickly I put it on, especially this month. I have no idea how many calories I regularly consume on a daily basis and I'm terrified that if I don't count them my weight will never stop going up.
Is this rapid weight gain normal for my situation? 

Or is it attributed to my antidepressants? I am terrified of my antidepressants will or are making me rapidly gain weight but I'm also terrified to go off them because I was even worse off before them.

also my clinical depression (was diagnosed with it but stopped seeing a therapist) is not letting me think of any reasonable reason of why i want to recover? my only reason really is  i just want to be content with food and enjoy it while i am alive . and  sometimes this is not enough reason for me ..

i don't really have a social life or friends to (impress) or  social activities it's just me and my cats , so why i am doing this to myself ? because of my family and their treatment and childhood trauma and other stuff that i won't be talking about here .

my goal is just to be content with my body and eat normally without feeling guilty , but at the same time i feel like a spoiled child especially when people keep sayin there are children in wars out there without food and i should be grateful for what i have .. it makes me feel like a spoiled human especially if i tell someone about what's going on with me and my ed because i feel guilty for acting this way, and feel guilty for them having to hear my rants . 

is it possible for someone like me to recover ? will i ever be content with my food intake again ? how to feel comfortable with your body in recovery ?

My dietitian gave me a starting meal plan but I feel I have no accountability outside of my parents and a big part of me starting to restrict was about me not liking when they tried to dictate what I could eat. So I've been restricting as much as I can using the meal plan portions and what I have in the house. I can follow the meal plan and eat much less than I was eating before so I feel like I have to. I don't know why. My behaviours were all about restricting my calories. And the meal plan doesn't address calories or give me a minimum. But I'm scared if I use calorie counting as a recovery tool I will get stuck on it forever. I just want to fix my relationship with food. I feel so unhappy every single day, all I can think about is food and my weight. Restricting doesn't bring me any joy or comfort it just makes me anxious. But the help hasn't helped.

how can i let go and try to make recovery progress starting NOW when i am so afraid of going to inpatient? there isn't much of a reassessment process, they've told me that they recommend a higher level of care even three months down the line, judging by my current condition. :(",1623255133.0

I had extreme hunger and went against my dietitian's advice to decrease my intake and ""not get so big/past my goal weight"" (pretty fatphobic of her imo). I had been reading a lot of Tabitha Farrar's blog and ""The F*ck It Diet"" and was hugely inspired by the ""all-in"" method.

So fast-forward a year. The past 8-10 months I've been struggling with almost zero appetite. All foods are neutral to me now, but they are now neutrally nausea-inducing. I have to force myself to eat. I struggle to eat regularly (my job doesn't help). I have no idea why.

I am depressed, but honestly have been better than I've been in a long time. I take wellbutrin, so maybe that's suppressing appetite?

I am stressed living at home with my parents while I prepare to go to an accelerated nursing program. Maybe it's stress?

Maybe my body is making me not hungry to lose all the overshoot weight? I overshot by a looooooot. But that doesn't make sense because I just keep gaining and gaining.

Maybe I'm not eating regularly enough to keep my metabolism running and my body shuts down and goes into starvation mode?

I have no idea. Does anyone relate or have a solution? Also what can help in the meantime to actually eat? I'm so sick (literally) of being nauseous when I've been working so hard on recovery 😭",1622584451.0

i have been in therapy for the past year and it was really great:) i just had my last session this week because i’m going on a 4 (ish) month road trip so continuing treatment wasn’t an option but i feel like i ended it in a really good place. generally i’m happy rn. i think. 
i talked a little bit about my body image and disordered eating habits with my therapist but only a few times because he doesn’t specialize in eating disorders. he expressed concerned when i told him about what i was doing at my worst, and how i was doing currently. then he checked in a couple more times in the past three months since i’d told him. 
so here’s the dealio:
i’m so worried about “relapsing” (quotation marks because i’ve never been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder) into my old habits. i automatically have a limited diet for the road because of space and money and i know that i’ll be hiking a lot and there’s a really high chance my weight will go down and then i’ll go back to harmful behaviors to keep whatever lower weight i end up at. 
there’s a chance nothing will happen but i’ve only recently (past 3-4 months) been eating three meals a day and not counting coffee with milk/creamer in it as a “meal” 
i already feel my skin crawling at the thought of it. no ones going to be with me to see if i eat or not and i’m so scared that i’ll just wreck my body. i want to be healthy and happy and love my body. eventually i want to talk to a ed specialist if not to get a diagnosis just to get some advice.

Those who have overcome an ED- How have you changed your relationship with food in a way that has allowed you to recover more easily?,6,n4zi78,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/n4zi78/those_who_have_overcome_an_ed_how_have_you/,4,"I used to, and I guess still occasionally do, suffer from anorexic impulses where I’d go days or weeks at a time not eating because I didn’t want to gain weight, because I hated the feeling of food in my stomach, because it was easier than trying to count out calories, because I hate being seen eating- the list, as I’m sure a lot of not all of yours do as well, goes on and on.

However for the past few months I decided that in order to counteract all those things and stop hurting was to change my relationship with food by trying to work out and gain muscle. It’s helped me a lot because it gives me a reason to eat, aside from ‘because I have to,’ and a reason to gain weight, and now the calorie counting has a purpose. I’m not advocating this as a cure-all for everyone, I’m just saying it has helped me.

I still hate the feeling of food in my stomach, but keeping my mind otherwise occupied helps a lot. This question goes out there to anyone else who has (or has temporarily) recovered: how have you changed your relationship with food? What has helped you stop avoiding it?

I’m a bit nervous to stop keto as the restriction felt like a safety blanket, but I think that in and of itself was a sign that it was doing more harm then good. I still feel intense guilt when I do eat, but getting into therapy again and focusing on enjoying how food tastes while still eating appropriate portions will hopefully help me get better with that.

So, I started keto. I am still doing keto and am still calorie counting. I have been for multiple months, and it wasn’t an issue until lately. Calorie counting has become obsessive. I think anything carb heavy is now a fear food. I can’t make myself eat even close to a reasonable amount, I have to force myself to eat anything. I am so uncomfortable with food in general that calorie counting and keto and measuring my food is the only thing I can do to feel “comfortable” enough to eat anything.

From my experience, that's a competitive thing hurting people say to make you feel bad. Like that they're better because you're fighting off hunger but they don't even have to try. I'm in recovery now, but it still upsets me. Because no matter how much I put myself through with my disorder, I just got hungrier and hungrier. Anorexic, bulimic, whatever. It was always a fight against hunger, because my body did not want to be tortured, it wanted to live. I'm always hungry. I'm never not hungry. Unless I'm severely depressed and it's very very obvious that depression makes you lose interest in things...and not that you're not hungry. 

And it's triggering for me to see all these people bragging about not being hungry, because we all know ED'S are about competition. Who can be the best at self harm. Who can talk the loudest. Can we talk about being healthy instead? Because if you're not hungry...you know the answer is you just have to force yourself to eat. Sorry...I don't feel bad for you. Recovery is hard and it's important to stick to meal times and go for it. The psychological issues or supportive words I'm here to help work through. But none of this bragging about never being hungry. I feel like you're trying to garner sympathy while being cutesy. I hate that feeling of: I'm not as sick as them. I wish I was that sick.

Wanting to relapse after over 2 years of being recovered. Anyone have some similar experiences?,8,mwkade,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/mwkade/wanting_to_relapse_after_over_2_years_of_being/,5,"Hi, this is my very first Reddit post despite having been on the site for years (my account was created only recently). I am brand new to this subreddit because I have been very steadily recovered for over 2 years at this point. Honestly, I consider myself very lucky as my recovery has been fairly smooth with minimal bumps and bruises in between. I won’t go to into my past because I’d like to keep this short and get right to the point.

This past week has been a bit rough for me mentally and emotionally and I have recently begun thinking heavily about my weight and food. This is super surprising to me because I have not had these kinds of thoughts for at least a year. I am disgusted with myself because, put bluntly, I WANT my ED to come back. It makes me angry to even type that. I can’t explain it very well. I am upset because I have worked hard to get to this point. I have worked hard to dismiss my old mindset and move on from the past and yet, I feel myself willing to go through all it again just so I can be underweight. 

Here are somethings I think have recently triggered me:

-Because I have been confident in my recovery, I have been following the subreddit r/EUGENIACOONEY for a bit now. have never seen her as thinspo and it was never my intention to see her as inspiration. Having gone through an ED myself, I just find it fascinating to see someone so publicly go through one. The comments on the subreddit also point out the awful health side effects of not treating your body right, which I actually see as inspiration to stay recovered. Still, seeing this content has made me more aware of the ED mindset I have in the back of my head.

-My old friend who openly has an ED has started to drop weight. We don’t talk anymore, but I still see her occasionally at school and I can tell she is going through a rough patch right now. For some reason I am beginning to see this as some sort of challenge. I almost want to prove to our mutual friends that I am “sicker” than her. That I can practice more self discipline.

-I recently told this guy I’ve been dating that I love him. He said it back and I felt on top of the world. I have been open with him about my past history with my ED and he was very understanding and caring and sees no reason to be concerned because of how well I’ve recovered. Knowing that he loves and cares for me as much as I care for him has made me want to be the best version of myself possible. I’ve started to think that he deserves me “dainty-er” and skinnier. I have no idea why I have begun to correlate my self worth and “lovable-ness” with my weight again.

I am curious about any thoughts/comments on this and if anyone has had a similar experience deep into their recovery. Any advice is also welcome! Thank you guys. Much love to anyone and everyone in this community!",1619142069.0

Mum triggering ED - need advice on how to talk to her about it.,8,mp2br9,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/mp2br9/mum_triggering_ed_need_advice_on_how_to_talk_to/,3,"Hi - so I’m overweight and in my early 20s and due to the pandemic I got stuck at my mum’s house. Since my teens I had issues of restricting and then binging, especially when my depression is bad, and this transitioned to occasionally getting so repulsed by the food I ate I felt some weird need to throw it up. Still trying to pluck up the courage to see my dr about it- I already feel ashamed and I’m worried because I’m overweight they’ll laugh me out of the room. I’m trying to set a healthy routine of eating nourishing meals and a healthy exercise routine because I want to lead a more active and healthier life style (and because my job includes fieldwork and I want to enjoy that more) rather than doing it with the goal of losing weight. However my mum keeps saying really triggering things. I was chubby since puberty and she’s always seemed careless with her words. However certain phrases e.g. ‘earning’ food through exercise or speaking about restricting her own e.g. not eating a certain food completely because it’s unhealthy has been really triggering my desire to restrict but also shifting my view of food from neither good or bad - just fuel, to something I should be afraid of. I don’t think she means to, and I know it comes from a place of love, but It’s really tough to be around. I have two questions 1) I’m worried I’m being over sensitive around these things, and maybe this is a ‘me’ problem and I need to toughen up? And 2) how do I approach the topic with her that it’s bothering me so much?",1618184791.0

The past couple years I hadn't been eating much due to being depressed and not having much of an appetite. I used to never eat breakfast, often skipped lunch, and usually just ate a few snacks in place of it. I'd almost always eat dinner though. 

Now I'm eating a small breakfast on workdays, lunch, dinner, and snacks in between meals (basically I'm actually paying attention to when I'm hungry). At my lowest weight I was like 92ish pounds. I'm now 100-103ish. Some of it's water weight so it's hard to tell how much I've actually gained but I've gained around 5-10ish pounds in the past month or two. None of the weight gain really seems visible and my clothes fit about the same.

One year,3,mmojbh,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/mmojbh/one_year/,2,"Around this month last year I really started to delve deep into restricting. I haven’t been diagnosed nor do u think it’s a good idea. Im quite overweight for my height and being hospitalized and forced to eat thru a tube or whatnot would really unnerve me. I dunno the etiquette for this forum so im not posting my weight or height or even what I think i might be struggling with until i know for sure/know it’s okay. I think i have a mix of a lot of things binge/restrict, anorexia, i dunno the name of the one that’s like “obsessed with eating healthy” like I won’t eat anything if it has a certain level of sugar or carb intake. I dunno sorry if im just all over the place, i just don’t know where to talk about these things or get help. My family keeps noticing that im losing weight and for awhile that satisfied me, knowing i was noticeably smaller. But i think im just unhappy with a lot of things about myself and food has always been this crutch i would lean on as a kid. I’d eat so much and so fast that I didn’t give my body and brain time to process the food. Does anyone else experience that? Anyone else binge on food and think “I really shouldn’t be eating thus much.” But do it anyways? Im just so all over everywhere and everything. I feel like im alone in this, i dont think I’d even begin to understand what it’s like to struggle with not eating at all, bc i eat some but I can’t go cold turkey. Part of me really feels disgusted with myself that I can’t even do that part right.

I’m Confused,5,lvecry,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/lvecry/im_confused/,3,"Hello Everyone,
I’m never sure what is triggering or not so I apologize in advance and let this be a warning. 

I’ve struggled with eating habits for roughly 12 years now (I’m 22). In the beginning it started with binge eating because of cultural norms and coping with bullying and family dynamics. At the age of 13/14 I hated myself for have always been overweight and being incredibly self conscious I started skipping meals. Around 14/15 I started calorie counting/restricting/purging/excessive exercising and that continue until I was about 18. I was calorie counting/binging/purging from then up until just very recently. I’ve come a long way in all of those behaviors but I still struggle greatly with urges and am currently classified as obese per my BMI so I’m actively trying to lose weight while finding methods that won’t put me at risk of great relapse.  When approaching my therapist with this difficulty and how it is frustrating to feel “recovered” I’m still in need of losing weight and have to take psych medication to tone down my inner dialogue related to this issue. She said to not think of myself as a person with an eating disorder because of my behaviors in the past and to jot out myself in the recovery community because I don’t have the same medical needs as someone with anotexia mercies and that I just need to accept myself and love myself for who I am and that’ll tart to fix my problems (She said it with more compassion and sensitivity but that’s all I could interpret in the moment). And it was so hard to hear that all I did was come home and cry myself to sleep. I don’t understand why she said what she said and how I shouldn’t consider myself a person with a eating disorder that’s in recovery when literally every day I battle my inner thoughts and impulses around my body , food, and behaviors.

(TW) I’m spiralling again and this time I’m asking for help or empathy or encouragement. I’m *really* trying want recovery right now.,9,lsghhu,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/lsghhu/tw_im_spiralling_again_and_this_time_im_asking/,3,"I’ve been lurking here for a week or so now. This post is out of character for me. It’s weird that I’m more ashamed of my ED than I am about anything else. I’m spiralling fast, though, and I don’t know where to turn.

TW because I am triggered.

I’m a 35 year old mother, for context. It took my doctors way too long to realize that an ED was one of my problems, and I wasn’t underweight *because* of my health problems, but that I developed those problems because of long-term erratic eating, sleeping, and stress patterns. I was in denial for so many years, but now I see that I was hiding so many unhealthy habits that are still haunting me. No one around me saw it because I was never dangerously underweight, and I ate enthusiastically in front of my loved ones. 

I only spoke the words “eating disorder” to my husband of 10 years a few months ago. It took him a long time to adjust to it.

Long story short, health problems blah blah blah ... I recently had an operation that is helping me “get back to normal” as everyone keeps saying. Wtf is *normal* even? (TW) I’ve been sick since 2018. For me, normal is feeling hungry and being afraid to eat because of the pain I know I will be in later. Normal is *trying really hard* to eat a full meal even though I’m nauseated by the feeling of eating.  Normal is listening to my stomach growl and savouring the empty feeling until it goes away. Normal is those obsessive behaviours I won’t detail here. Can I achieve the “healthy” normal?

Now I’m facing my food issues head on. It’s mental and physical; I don’t want to eat because I like how I look when I’m under-eating, and also because large amounts of food makes my body feel more horrible than minor starvation. Despite being under good medical care, I’m never going to get better until I get the counselling I’m waiting for. 

If anyone relates and wants to talk about this without judging me for my choices, and perhaps my lifestyle, I’m open to discussion. I’m sick of feeling so isolated.",1614286065.0

My therapist talked about some rules and one of them is that my mum needs to portion my meals and the things I eat but this is really hard for me because I get forced to eat now and I can’t do anything against it. My father sometimes yells at me to make me eat but it’s really really stressful for me. I know he loves me and I love him but he always says that I’m going to die and this puts a lot of pressure on me bc I really don’t know what to do.
I‘m terrified of gaining weight and bc I have to eat now I can’t loose any more which stresses me out. I don’t want to loose control and binge or something like that and so I don’t want to recover but on the other hand I really want to be free again. Can anyone give me some advice?

I’ve suffered with every eating disorder throughout my life. It started off healthy, just trying to work out and lose some healthy weight. I spiralled into bulimia (b/p) when I was 16 for a good 1.5 years. Then I went vegan, became orthorexic and addicted to excercise. Then, restriction began. I suffered with restriction and anorexia for years later, with occasional b/p relapses. (I really hated this, and I tried my best not to because it made me feel horrible) when I began college, I started to finally recover, finally see the light. I started to eat what I wanted, workout freely, eat with others, not be so strict but once again my ed slowly crept up on me. I was rigid with my intake, never ever ever ate past 6/7pm, and had a strict workout routine. When I moved back home, things changed and I began eating less, working out more. I lost tons on weight, and felt burnt out. I HATE how I was and have always been strict with my routine/timings. Can never eat dinner before 7 or past8, before it was 5 then 6, etc. 

Now, I tend to over exercise (sometimes I could just walk on the treadmill for like 6 hours a day) and eat my dinner, and binge at night. Absolutely go off. 

I’m so tired of this. I just need someone to talk to. It’s hard to open up fully to others. I’m ashamed. 

It doesn’t help that my boyfriend is extremely flexible with his food and doesn’t have any set times for his eating, just goes with the flow.

Recently though, he's started forgetting meals (which could be real, although I have trouble believing that this is truly innocent if it's a common occurrence), as well as saying he's lactose intolerant, while still eating cheesy foods, ice cream, etc. To me, that's a huge red flag and I've seen it in myself and others as an attempt to restrict foods, and could very easily be the start of a cycle of restriction and guilt. He struggles with depression and anxiety already, and has been unable to exercise or socialize a whole lot for the last year, due to COVID.

Does anyone else who is attempting recovery follow through and just eat what they want? I don’t want to but I do at the same time if that makes sense ?

People have reinforced the idea that the meal plan is a minimum but I am scared of bingeing and I feel that all the food I want I shouldn’t have as in my head I label them as “foods to avoid” even though that is not the best thing to do realistically... it will just make the restriction-binge cycle stronger 
However, I’ve not binged in a while, I’ve felt more in control which I’m pleased about but at the same time I feel a sort of guilt around that because part of me (the disordered part) feels that I am in Control of eating “bad” food which I “shouldn’t be eating”

I lost a lot of weight quickly, from being borderline overweight for my height right down to the underweight for my height (only underweight by a couple kilos but the very quick drop is probably what made my period stop)

Shockingly, today, I went to the toilet and realised I got a period - very very light but still it was there. (My periods have always been super light and last for a day or two). I am so so confused as I technically shouldn’t be getting my period as I am still borderline underweight? Has anyone else experienced this? 
It’s kinda fucking me up cos I was not expecting it to come and it was one of my goals to motivate me to gain... but now, when I’m still in a major caloric deficit which hasn’t changed for 6 months straight (it’s still my meal plan set by my doctors but because my body’s not used to large intake their slowly building it up, but we’re still at the lowest meal plan of and haven’t increased yet as I haven’t been able to), I have already got it back so I’m absolutely terrified of gaining or eating more than I currently am. 

Please help or say something or relate because I’m really struggling.

On the whole, eating doesn't give me pleasure anymore. And it absolutely sucks because this lack of pleasure, this ambivalence I have towards food as a whole makes it really difficult for me to want to eat and enjoy the act of doing it. It's not even connected to wanting to lose weight, I don't obsess over food anymore, it's just a lack of interest on the whole. When I do eat it's difficult to eat a normal/healthy portion of food because of my stomach being so shrunken, I often don't finish meals all the way. It's hard to say if I'm even struggling with an eating disorder anymore. I mean surely there's something wrong with my food intake but my anorexia before I went into recovery was characterized by obsessive thoughts, weighing, you know.

Hello all, first time poster here. I feel very dumb but I haven't found the rules for this sub (not used to reddit) so I sincerely apologize if my posts breaks any of them.

I'm a woman recovering from bulimia / binge ED and I'm in a place where I'm almost completely fine mentally in regards to the ED. It's been several years now since I had a bad episode.

However, I gained a lot of weight because of binging, and even though I lost some of it when I stopped, I'm still very overweight. I'm in this dumb situation where you have to lose weight to be healthy but you're too scared you'll fall back into your dangerous habits. I get anxious even just thinking ""I have to exercise a little for my health"" because it just gives me flashbacks to when I was deep into my ED. I'm trying to come up with reasons to exercise and eat healthy OTHER than losing weight, that way I can focus on those reasons instead.

Anyways, here's the problem  I recently noticed.

Whenever I see a woman who looks fit and beautiful in my eyes, I get the urge to binge. I would look at instagram or at a YouTube video and see a pretty girl, think ""damn, she looks good"", and then immediately get up and go eat an entire pack of cookies. It didn't occur to me that those actions might be connected until not too long ago. You'd think ""duh, classic case of comparing yourself to these girls and that triggers your ED"". But...

The thing is, I am attracted to women. so when I do this, I just think I'm checking them out. I didn't even feel like I was comparing myself to them. But I think deep down, I can't help but wishing I looked like them as well. The binges are not extreme compared to what I experienced in the past, which is why it took time to dawn on me that that wasn't healthy.

Does this happen to anyone else? What do you think could help with coping? I can obviously limit my Instagram intake (I have been unfollowing a lot of models or celebrities that I noticed made me feel bad about myself) or even delete it completely, but there are still a lot of pretty girls out in the everyday world and it would be unrealistic to think I can just avoid all triggers.

TLDR: Recovering from binge eating disorder, get urges to binge automatically when seeing pretty girls. Anyone else in this situation?

Thanks in advance guys.",1609286605.0

by the end of my second summer abroad I had gained about 30lbs to be 150lbs in a little over a year. By the end of my first trip to japan, none of the clothes i brought with me fit anymore. Same by the end of being in hong kong. i felt like a vile gelatinous blob and always sick, my stomach hurting or my nose running or something.

but i love being abroad, i loved the places and people and food and it feels like home to me

In america i am thin and average height with a nice build.

I weigh about 54-55 kg (120-123ish lbs) and am 169-170 cm.

in asia i am a towering monster giantess with thunderthighs and looking at myself even at my lowest, current weight disgusts me. people stare or shrink away. or maybe they dont, but i feel like they do.

I ended up developing what i think is some sort of ed over the pandemic. last december i was at 118 lbs because i was working 8 hour shifts and then going to school and coming home just to sleep. people commented how good i looked, i felt physically better at that weight, but it wasn't sustainable and I gained back up to almost 130. I'm back down again to \~121-123

I want to recover? i dont like having this weird obsession with food and restricting and binging and purging and the whole miserable 9 yards, and it's only every few days that it really gets bad, but I try to stick to 2 meals a day and workout every day and not let myself have treats, even though i love pastries and milk and puddings...

but maybe im better off this way.

my contract in japan starts in april. will they finally look at me like a model or the ""ideal foreigner""? will i still have to be ashamed at this weight? I won't be able to eat with my coworkers...or drink or go to nomikai if i want to keep this weight, or if i do i'll have to purge right after but...

if i stay the weight i am maybe ill be accepted, maybe i can feel like i fit in and love myself a little more even if im being hard on my body.

I'm not underweight. so why should i even be worried? I still eat meals, i only purge every now and then, im still social and sleep ok and do normal people things, other than crying all the time and throwing up occaisonally. I'm super healthy by all measures according to my doctor. but i have such a hard relationship with food. maybe its better to stay like this so i can maybe not hate myself though.

All i want is to be tiny and straight-bodied and petite, but i think no matter how much weight i lose I'll never be that. maybe if i keep trying? if i hit the gym harder? if I only eat veggies? I love vegan food...what if im vegan? if i make rules for myself so i cant ""cheat""

I  (20F) haven't been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder but last year an acquaintance mentioned how he thought I was ""getting fat"" and that sent me into a year long spiral, I started dieting and counted my calories. I planned my meals days in advance and would refuse to eat or drink anything that ""wasn't planned"". I also insisted on working out several times a week even after I injured my leg (I pulled a ligament in my ankle and couldn't walk properly but still went to the gym). I tried to cut out sugar completely for half a year.
For a little backstory, I've always been on the smaller side, and I even became underweight as a teenager (not intentionally, my metabolism was just high) . Once I started university (and was on the pill for a year) I started putting on a bit of weight and finally looking healthier. I don't know why I took that guy's comment to the heart, especially since I was basically a size 8 (UK) at that point. After stopping the pill which made me gain weight and crave sweets a lot I went down a size (now i'm a 6) but I still tried to only eat twice a day for a couple months because I was terrified that I will ""get fat in lockdown"". 
What I do have is OCD and that's probably what caused this episode, and after talking about it with my therapist I've been feeling more calm and even eat 3 proper meals a day. But some days it's harder, and I think I'm gaining weight and I'm afraid of people pointing it out 😭 my family and gf are very supportive and compliment me a lot but sometimes i have this really twisted view of myself and my brain thinks that being overweight is the end of the world, when I should be thankful I'm not underweight anymore.

There’s more to life! Choose recovery!,13,j4tee9,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/j4tee9/theres_more_to_life_choose_recovery/,0,"I’d been trapped in an ED mindset for the past 4 years. I have had highs and lows but for the past 6 months steadily, I have actively engaged in ED behaviors. I’ve lost weight and have achieved, yet again perhaps, the “perfect body” to some. But am I happy? Nope. Shocking, right?  So, I’m taking a new approach to life. 

An eating disorder robs you of your identity, ultimately. 95% of your thoughts, in some cases, may be focused and centered around numbers, tracking, restricting, pure obsessiveness, and ultimately, discontent. I feel as if I have no peace; I’m not living fully. An eating disorder takes your peace. You will never be fulfilled while engaging in ED behaviors. 

You may find yourself asking, “When will this end? When will I finally be happy with myself?” The answer is not to be found in your physical appearance or numbers. You are so much more than a body; you are a soul. In fact, you are your soul. Your body will deteriorate; your soul will not. 

Take a moment to think about your crush. Do you have a crush on them merely for their body? Think about it. If you answer yes to this question, then you have got some thinking to do. Most of us would answer a big NO! We’re attracted to true beauty. Perhaps the essence of beauty is compassion, gentleness, strength, and selflessness. 
Can we truly be any of these things, these virtues most people desire to possess, if we are constantly fixated on our eating disorders(aka, ourselves)? 
The simple answer is no.

True happiness results from dying to ourselves and finding purpose in living for others. We cannot be this wonderful human we, ourselves, dream of meeting someday if we choose to focus on our EDs, folks! 

You are more than a number. You are more than a body. Your beauty is not skin-deep. You deserve to live a free, beautiful life. Now, read that again. You, yes, YOU deserve a life ED-free. Please, choose it so you can be entirely authentically yourself. Choose recovery so you can have a personality again. Choose recovery so you slowly learn that food is nothing to be scared of; it’s a true gift that brings people who care for each other together. Choose recovery so you can share a dinner in town with your date and not panic over the thought of it. Choose it so you can eat anything and not feel immense, debilitating guilt after doing so. 

 Having been on both sides of the spectrum, recovery always wins. So much more joy is to be found in letting go of your ED and being truly free. There’s SO much more to life than being stuck in your mind. I decided to choose LIFE and you need to too. 

I pray you choose life today. Choose recovery. Choose YOU! 

Although it may be terrifying, I assure you it’s so worth it. You are not only worthy, but deserving of the most incredible life you could’ve ever dreamed of living. If you’re not living it now, what’s stopping you from trying a new approach to it? What have you got to lose? The truth is you have nothing to lose, but possibly everything to gain. 

After all, everything you want is on the other side of fear. ❤️",1601787468.0

I'm always the one asking if he'd like to have something too or if he'd like to go get lunch.

Often times he'll get annoyed at me for telling him it's lunch time or way past it etc. 

The problem is that I am immensely triggered by his inability to sustain a 'normal' eating rhythm and end up skipping meals as well because I just can't deal with it. I don't need him to always eat when I'm eating, or that he eats the same amounts as me, I'd just really appreciate it if he didn't skip lunch and all snacks every single day.

No one never helped me to recover, I did it all by myself. Until I was underweight it was easy to eat +2000 calories a day, plus I was hungry all the time. But once I started to gain weight I restricted again, not as much as before, around 1300 calories a day.

Not only for the fact that I’m gaining weight but also I don’t know how much should I eat anymore. I don’t have hunger signals, and I’m so used to eating low calories food, eating little ecc. that it’s hard to fit in +1600 calories. 

I don’t know anymore what’s normal to eat in a day. I don’t know how many calories I am supposed to eat. If I had to eat intuitively I sure will eat 1400/1500 calories because I’m so used to eat large quantities of low calorie food that fills me up.

I entered a spiral of self-hatred and fell into a eating disorder. I always had irregular periods and with the low carb diet my cycle was 100% regulated I think i mess up everything when i started not eating enough and stop eating groups of food that i can eat.

Amenorrhea,4,hp4i68,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/hp4i68/amenorrhea/,10,"Hi everyone!
I suffered from anorexia (never got to an extra low weight but I was ""severely underweight"" according to bmi charts) and I lost my period pretty soon (I lost 20 kg, and I lost my period at around -6kg).
Without support from my family (my mom is just now realizing that I was truly mentally ill even tho I never looked like a walking skeleton thanks to good genetics) I had to recover by myself. I ate a good amount of food, around 2000-3000 kcals, but I kept working out (with few weeks-long hiatuses) and I never let myself go out of control (aka I never binged/listened to extreme hunger). I then slowly got better and now I can say I'm almost recovered: I don't count calories, I eat whatever I want, I workout when and as much as I fancy, my weight is healthy and so Is my body fat mass... I only have two things holding me back: I weight myself several times a day (3-5 times), and my period never came back.
The weight on the scale doesn't affect my eating, I still listen to my body, but it can ruin my mood.
And the period... Well, I learnt that the only weight to get it back naturally is by eating enough food/nutrients. Unfortunately, I eat very little (I've never been someone who eats a lot) and I'm rarely hungry (I'm talking 1400-1800 kcals a day max, more or less). What should I do? Has someone experienced something similar?
P. S. I know that talking to a professional is the best option, but I can't afford therapy and theres no free therapy where I live + I had some gynecological visits for this problem two months ago and everything is perfect except for an alarmingly low amount of estrogen.",1594444474.0

I have binge eating disorder and was seeing a therapist for it during most of 2019. I’ve gotten much better and don’t binge anymore. I do still suffer with other symptoms of my eating disorder such as low self esteem, restrictive eating, depression, and anxiety. As well as some childhood trauma that my mother is very much aware of. 

I was making so much progress while going to therapy and after I was finished with it. I was down almost thirty pounds, and on my way to a healthy relationship with food. With the quarantine my healthy eating habits got put on the back burner. I’ve been eating the old processed crap I used to eat all day everyday. Now I just eat that crap at my normal scheduled times that me and my therapist came up with. When I was doing what I needed to I was buying my own groceries and not eating out. Now that I’m not working as much anymore I rely on what my parents buy for food. There isn’t a fresh vegetable in the house anymore. 

That brings us to yesterday. I had checked my weight on the scale. Since my last therapy appointment in January I gained nine pounds. Maybe I was overreacting, but I cried and felt like a failure. I went to my mom which was the biggest mistake. 

She told me basically not to be sad because “You are in shape! Round is a shape!” She loves that stupid joke so much... She said that to try and make me feel better. When I started crying more because of that, she told me her and I could go on a walk and be fat asses together. I had to leave after that point and pretended that her “words of encouragement” made me feel better. I haven’t felt this low in such a long time.",1593531633.0

My reaction is always emotional, either anger directed outward, that the weight requirement exists at all, like how dare they advertise needing more blood when they block so many eligible donors because of this stupid weight requirement. Or guilt and shame about my body, directed inward.

im so hungry all the time but i feel like i eat so much,9,f9jpvp,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/f9jpvp/im_so_hungry_all_the_time_but_i_feel_like_i_eat/,2,"potentially triggering so please take care: this is a post asking for tips and advice as i try to recover and lose weight at the same time. i dont want to fall back into my starve binge repeat habit, but im hating how my current meal/appetite is acting. 

some history: i have a long history with trauma and self destructive behavior including selfharm, anorexia and bulimia. ive never really stopped having a bad relationship with food and restrictions, but this year ive really tried to eat like a normal person but its driving me fucking mad because im the heaviest ive ever been eating three meals a day. im 5’3 ish and 154? lbs. idk because the weight scale we have rn is broken. its the highest number ive ever seen for me. and i notice the difference, new thickness, discomfort in previously comfortable positions, my clothes feeling so much tighter. my happiest weigh thats healthy for my body type seems to be 130-135 and i was eating two solid meals and feeling satisfied 

im trying to find the courage to exercise, because unlike a lot of people it seems? i have always been so terrified of exercising. i dont like how it makes me even hungrier than i already am, so i would just starve for so long at a time sometimes for 3 days id eat like 1-2 snacks, see how many hours i could go without it and try to beat that number. i would live normal days or do nothing and watch myself lose 5lbs in a week and feel good about it. but the binges have always been terrible and id lose and gain so rapidly all the time for years of my life. ive been in therapy for 7 years but have rarely discussed this because im ashamed of admitting that i feel ugly and fat. idk why this is the one thing i feel like i cant tell the truth about to fucking anyone despite talking about the most horrible things ive been thru with a lot less stress. perhaps because i feel like the abuse i endured from other people i know is not my fault, but that my views on myself and how i treat myself is mostly on me. but it loops in my head because i know trauma really impacts all of my behavior and psychical conditions. so i just dunno. 

but to reiterate- i feel like i eat so goddamn much but i feel so hungry all the time. i eat sometimes 4 times a day now or more on the weekends. the weirdest thing for me- the “hungry” is not the hungry i know. its like, my body is craving the food so fucking bad- but like my stomach doesnt. i over eat every time. its driving me crazy. i try to eat healthier things tho- lots of veggies and fruits, but im vegetarian and i eat a lot of carbs and sometimes i go crazy on sugar. its just so much!!!! i cant seem to do anything between over eating and under eating and im losing my mind. does anyone have a way to break the cravings??? im an artist and i work at home right next to the kitchen and i fucking hate how its RIGHT THERE ALL DAY. im sure it has a lot to do with not leaving the house and being next to food all day long, im all alone, and since im thinking about starving i tell myself to do the opposite. im almost 7 months selfharm free and i know that is really not helping. i always have disturbed sleep so my energy is always fucked. i dont have health insurance or a doctor, i get government therapy and  a psych but i dont take any meds. 

does anyone know how to help me limit myself with eating constantly?? ive tried meal plans but i just dont feel satisfied after i eat so i spend all the time im not eating thinking about how good food sounds even when im not actually hungry. i dont feel the pit of my stomach u kno what i mean??? idk im just so lost and i dont know who else to ask aside from people who have recovered and maybe experienced something like this. thank u to anyone who reads and thank u for this sub. 💞",1582674292.0

However, in turn I eat way less ( maybe a slice of cake and some popcorn, nothing with nutritional value at all) but I have absolutely no urge to exercises. And because I don’t want to exercise I also don’t want to eat much because I’m not doing any work. I walk too and from uni everyday which works out to be about at 40 min walk everyday and at a fast past. And I’ve started yoga twice a week. But I don’t do anything more than that. Part of me says I should but the other part refuses. And that’s the part that’s also refusing to eat properly. So at the moment my diet consists of popcorn, rice crackers, maybe a biscuit or too and some low cal hot choc. And that’s not even all in one day. 

But what I really need opinions on is exercise, Everyone on here seems to either run or go to the gym. I just don’t want to. Is that a bad thing ? Does anyone else feel like this about exercise ?

I first thought, “surely she’s just saying that because we are both beginners”—  she proceeds to swim all the strokes correctly and with relative ease— and I realize she wasn’t talking about skill — she was referring to the size of our bodies. Clearly she was experienced and the only thing that we shared was our body size. 


But by that point I had already agreed with her, before I realized fully what she was saying.

My heart sank, I wanted to tap her on the shoulder and say,”large bodied people  have every right to be here as small bodied people” but instead I just kept quiet... 


I stood in the shower after my swim and realized why it was important that I unapologetically exist as a large bodied person. It was a reality check seeing someone my size degrade and belittle themselves for no other reason than body size.

I am not a very seasoned redditor, and I am new to this group today so I'm not sure if this is the place for me or not yet. 
I am 28. I have been considered ""recovered"" from my bulimia by most of my friends and family for about 6 years now. What they do not realize is that, just because I managed to pull my face out of the toilet ( most days)  does not mean that still don't struggle with disordered thoughts and body dysmorphia every second of every day. 
At my worst I was purging around 2-5 times a day on average. Sometimes it was a full blown binge, others just after a snack I didn't think I deserved. I had horrible acid reflux, tooth decay, and scars on my knuckles. Now I would say I purge only about once a month, and only in a moment of weakness after overeating. I never intentionally binge and purge anymore. 

That being said, I have lost a lot of the support I once had from those close to me. Not like it's a choice they have made, just that it's not as in their face anymore so they don't think about it as much. While I have come a really long way, and I am very proud of the progress I have made, I still have a long way to go before I can honestly say that I'm comfortable in this body. 

I feel like this part of the recovery doesn't really get talked about. The part when if feels like everyone but you has forgotten that you were on death's door not that long ago. My question is how do you continue to push? What are some things I can do to improve my mental state? 

I have put on some weight in the last few years and I am very uncomfortable with my body right now. It's been so bad lately that I dont even want to be naked to shower, let alone be seen or touched by my husband. I worry that this will hurt my marriage unless I get myself together, because I am constantly turning him down. (What is that doing to HIS self esteem?)

i was asking about advice based on my eating disorder and asking if before trying recovery again i should go ahead and have the binge food i was craving for the last three days. I ended up ordering it and thinking I could let this one roll off my back. Now that I’m waiting for the order I’m getting anxiety and wondering if I just really fucked up.

Basically I restrict and binge eat, both separate eating disorders developed in different points in my life with different triggers. Which is why the “just dont restrict and you won’t binge” method seems to not work.

But I need to get physiotherapy and my mom wants to help me make a meal plan tomorrow because I texted her crying and scared to go to work the next day because I binged and I am at my highest weight in years. Fashion is a creative outlet for me but also a huge trigger there are tons of great pieces I want but am too fat and too broke to do so.

My restriction has lately gotten so much more comfortable and the binges have gotten so much more addictive and I’m a bit afraid of how my food is going to affect me emotionally after I’ve eaten it.

I had food delivered 3 times this week already, the delivery lady knows me by name and said hi to me where I work because she recognized me. I threw away most of one of my 73 dollar order and just ordered almost 50 dollars of food tonight. She doesnt seem to mind at all and I used to work in food service and relate.. we like reoccurring customers who aren’t complete assholes to food service workers who typically order the same things.

Recovery tips,8,d7f9c4,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/d7f9c4/recovery_tips/,1,"I really want to get better and I just wondered if anyone has any tips or anything or ways to distract yourself.

So I'm a 14F and for a couple years I've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that I was fat and I've always been trying things to lose weight because I was only in the 49/50th percentile for my height ""5'0"" (I'm very small and even though I'm 14 I've basically stopped growing) I tried things like I've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired (I barely ate lunch at school in the past two/three years) and rarely I would make myself throw up. I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.

That was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally. Food became my obsession and it controlled my life I couldn't function properly and I was so... So hungry. I felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.

The first few months were hard because I was gaining and didn’t think I could ever feel full again (I was just sooooo hungry). Those fears are mostly gone now. I can feel full and do so after every meal.

I went into treatment with the goal of never having to go back. I worked hard, went to every group, took notes and tried to learn from my team and the recovering people around me.

I've been recovering for the past 2 years or so but  have found the disordered mindset quite difficult to shake off.
Discomfort over my weigh gain and fantasizing about being thin again took up a lot of headspace and I never felt recovered mentally. 

Although not a solution in themselves, I've found that using shrooms has helped me look at my disordered thoughts more objectively and since tripping i've been able to ignore them more easily. I think that they showed me that I didn't need to remain stuck in this mindset and that it was a thought loop that actually could be broken out of.
In some ways, it feels like they've reset my self-image and allowed me to re-evaluate my sense of self-worth and create goals that aren't focused around trying to manipulate my body  in a destructive way. 
I also think that it has helped me process feelings of discomfort more constructively- in the 'afterglow' from my trip i felt amazing in my own skin, and had more positive feelings towards my body than i had ever expected to have. While I was aware that this would fluctuate and would not be permanent, I'm trying to hold on to the idea that good days like these are possible- and actively work towards remembering how these days feel on the not so good days.

What I have learned from seeing a registered dietician,13,8pl216,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/8pl216/what_i_have_learned_from_seeing_a_registered/,3,"There was a post on [r/AskWomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen) about having a healthy relationship with food. Seeing so many people struggling there, I felt compelled to write up what I have learned from seeing a dietician.  I just realized it may be helpful here also!

* Eat at least 15g of protein within an hour of waking up. Whether or not I do this is the biggest indicator of my mood, hunger cues, and eating habits the rest of the day. Please try it. It has changed my life. (amount is based on BMI)
* The plate model for lunch and dinner: 1/2 plate = vegetables, 1/4 plate = carbs, 1/4 plate = lean protein (fish, chicken, beans, nuts, seitan, tempeh, tofu, wheat gluten, etc.)
* Meal planning: plan out your meals for the entire week on one day (gets easier/quicker after a few weeks) and write a shopping list for only what you need. Shop one day a week (max two if you forget somethings) and stick to your list. Helps keep your grocery budget low and eliminates impulse purchases.
* **Your relationship with food and your body is the longest relationship you have. It is an ongoing process. That is okay.**
* Eat a snack in between lunch and dinner that contains a lean protein and a carb. (7\-10g protein)
* Beans = protein and carbs; nuts = protein and fats.
* FAT! You need healthy fats in your diet for important biological processes. (Nuts, fish, avocados, olive oil, dark chocolate, coconut/coconut oil, small servings of cheese, etc.) If you are faced with the option of high fat, low sugar VS low fat, high sugar \- choose the first one.
* Try for consistent meal times each day, including weekends. (roughly the same time \- this one is SO hard)

Eating balanced meals, eating a good amount, and eating consistently throughout the day helps way more than just how your body feels. It helps your mind, your mental health, and mood. I cannot say I have achieved perfection or anything close to it, but these steps have really helped me a lot.

EDIT: Please do not give yourself more food rules because of this post! I wish I had put a trigger warning and now I feel terrible.  These ideas are not right for everyone and not right for every stage of recovery! It may also be good to note that I implemented these things **one at a time over many months!!** All at once would have been impossible.I posted this because I know some people do not have the privilege of seeing their own dietitian.

Started IOP and it has not been easy,3,88rv6k,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/88rv6k/started_iop_and_it_has_not_been_easy/,0,Hello all! I have been diagnosed with depression and binge eating disorder just recently. I am a 37 Hispanic female who has probably had a problem since puberty but because of my culture and mental health something that is usually not talked about I never knew anything about it. I started IOP last Tuesday and it’s been extremely overwhelming. I started a blog to write my day to day process in recovery but also as an outlet for me to express how I feel. Even sometimes make fun of myself. Hence my username. And I also excited that I found this place as well. Certainly looking for another outlet and find some support from others going through the same thing. [my blog](www.donuttouchmymazapan.com),1522599042.0

I need to work at least 4 days a week to afford to pay my portion of the rent.  The boyfriend is willing to take on the other bills, but at this point, I am in need of help that i cannot afford, or wven afford to take the time off for.

Feeling extremely warm after large meals during recovery?,1,6bz60v,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/6bz60v/feeling_extremely_warm_after_large_meals_during/,3,"I've been in recovery for several months now (with slow but general progress). Something that I'm finding is that often times after eating a large meal, I become like a furnace. My palms become red, by face feels warm, and if it's at the end of the day I'll wake up in the middle of the night in a pool of sweat. It usually lasts anywhere from 15-45 minutes, and sets in anywhere from 30-90 minutes after eating. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Since I've started recovery I've stopped being freezing cold constantly, but I still run a good deal colder than most, which is why it's so noticeable. For what it's worth, at my lowest I was floating at a BMI of around 17 and I'm currently at a BMI of 17.5-18 or so (like I said, slow but general progress). ",1495141817.0

This is my first post on here, but I've lurked for a few months. I've suffered from anorexia for about 2 years now.  Recently, I finally decided that enough was enough.
I've been underweight for approximately a year, and severely underweight for about 6 months.  For the past month and a half, I have upped my calorie intake greatly.  Before, I was quite restrictive and I've been told I was close to collapse.

My question is... is the extreme constipation and gas I experience on a daily basis normal?
 At the risk of giving too much information, it's not uncommon for me to have a bowel movement every 3 days despite feeling painfully bloated and knowing that I'm putting a LOT of food in my body. The gas....well it's unlike anything I've ever smelled. It literally smells like I've shit myself, and it occurs 10+ times a day.
This makes it really hard to continue eating when I feel so full, and as if my body cant process the food fast enough.
Is this normal? Will it go away? When? Any replies would be so appreciated as this is a huge setback for me, and quite frankly it's making my life HELLA awkward. By the way, this thread is amazing and has been the inspiration for me to start this journey. Stay strong beautiful people.

Tips for the holiday period (posted to r/EDRecovery too),2,1462u3,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/1462u3/tips_for_the_holiday_period_posted_to_redrecovery/,0,"Gently ease into the holiday season by focusing on activities that don't involve food, such as putting up decorations, or sending e-cards.


Check in with your body before and while you are eating¡ Am I feeling hungry? Am I feeling full?


Remember that all food is neutral - there are no good or bad foods.


If it makes you feel better, organize your own food to take to a function or a meal, and let the host know that you will be doing this, in advance.


Stay away from any kind of good food/bad food/diet thinking or conversation.


If things don't go as planned, remember that one meal will not make a significant difference to your body.


If you are hosting a meal, allow people to bring food that they feel OK eating, if they wish to.


Try to shift the focus away from food and counting calories, to celebrating, and spending time with loved ones.


Work out your own support system in advance - identify close friends and/or family members that you can reach out to for support, if and when you need it. Or ask a friend if you can text her/him to check in, if you feel you need to.


Plan some alternative activities that you can do when you are feeling stressed or over-whelmed, e.g. taking the dog out for a walk, take a drive somewhere or call a friend.


Take care of yourself - if this means not going to a function, (or going to a function), then do what feels right for you at the time.


Surround yourself with people who have healthy relationships with their bodies, and who do not focus on food and weight. Or when attending gatherings, bring a trusted family member or friend along with you, if you can.


**Most of all, try and enjoy yourself, whatever you choose to do!**",1354485995.0

A question about subcultures,3,d8v2j,EDRecovery_public,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDRecovery_public/comments/d8v2j/a_question_about_subcultures/,2,"In the social circles that I travel (anarchism, feminism, punk, other identity/political groups) there is the common belief that followers of these subcultures are immune to eating disorders. That because these folks are outside of society and are fully capable of seeing through societal/advertising lies these subcultures are free from some of the pressures and root causes. However, I know feminists in recovery from an eating disorder (and the feminism/queer politics person as the case may be was ""in the know"" prior to recovery) so this is clearly a lie.

While eating disorders are intensely private and personal in their root causes, it seems to be in vogue to blame the media. These folks prove that if the media is taken out of the equation there can still be eating disorders. Is it just me that's noticing this?

((This is more of a discussion topic than a direct question, I know. It's just something that I've been thinking about lately.))",1283460886.0
