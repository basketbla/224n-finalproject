In December I started to stop eating lunch and I'm still in school so I'm able to lie to my parents that I had and tell them I want hungry and so eat as little dinner as possible. I started purging as well whenever I did eat lunch or if I felt I'd eaten too much or eaten soemthing unhealthy. And I felt so proud whenever I was hungry and didn't eat especially when it was painful. But after a week I reached out to someone online because I knew this was unhealthy and I started to eat properly again. Then some point just after Christmas I ate some chocolate someone bought be and I felt so disgusting and I purged again and I think it was then that I told an irl friend. When I went back to school i tried to eat properly but it was just really hard to and I would often skip lunches. But my friends started to help me and I had everything mostly under control until this week when I went off school for half term. And I've started skipping meals again and eating as little as I possibly can at dinner. Last night I really wanted to purge but managed not to. But today we had a takeaway and I struggled so hard to eat it and felt disgusting afterwards. And I really tried not to purge but I couldn't stop myself.",1645374756.0

Help,1,swrwdr,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/swrwdr/help/,1,"Hi everyone. Over the years I’ve struggled with eating. 2 years ago, I gained 50 lbs from binge eating. Then during the pandemic, I was home and lost the weight again. I’m still losing weight and I’ve never been lighter in my life, but I’m struggling. I work out every single day and HARD (sometimes burning 700 calories). In Addition to that, I can only get myself to eat about 1000 calories a day— sometimes 1200 but that is rare and I only feel okay with it if I burned a ton of calories from working out that day.

During the weekends though, I eat over 1200 calories— realistically probably about 1700, which should be normal, but after every weekend thay I’m not disciplined, I hop on the scale and the number kills me. 

Last night I had a moment, where I ate nachos. They were so good, but I ate all of them, and I started sobbing because I wanted to be disciplined this weekend. I felt terrible.

This morning, I woke up thinking to myself that I am done with my poor eating habits and struggling with eating. I’m a 21 year old female, and I should be able to consume at least 1800 calories a day without feeling terrible about it — especially if I’m working out at least 5 days a week! So I decided: “okay. Today is the day where I heal my metabolism, and I work to creating a healthier mindset.”

However, I hopped on the scale tonight before dinner and I had gained 7 pounds from the nachos from the night before, as well as drinking and from eating my hearty meals today. I physically and mentally cannot handle gaining 7 lbs in 2 days and if I continue to eat like this, I’m terrified of gaining weight. I feel helpless and have no idea what to do, because now I feel like I need to go back to 1000 calories a day but I know my thinking is not healthy. 

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice/thoughts/encouragement that they would like to share with me, and if so, I would greatly appreciate it. I just don’t know how to get my life back. Thank you!",1645328635.0

Am I the only one?,22,svm41j,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/svm41j/am_i_the_only_one/,4,"I am a 63 y.o. man. I am 5’10”, current weight is 115#. Since I was 13, I’ve obsessed about being fat. In my head I know I was never really overweight, but once my mother referred to me as “cute and chubby” it was game over. For years I fought against the “voices” telling to drop a few pounds. In my mid-30s, fighting hard, I joined a gym to put on muscle and redistribute my body fat. That kind of worked until I decided I was getting fat (I’d gotten up to 165# by age 38). I started  running, then I discovered spinning.  My doctor told me to stop because the weight loss was too much.  I was weighing my self every day.  By age 40, I was down to 140#, and sadly, I was pleased.  When I was 44y.o., my father died and I more or less lost my mind. I was eating just enough to stay alive, but I didn’t want to be, I guess. Friends and coworkers were quite worried. I starved myself down to 115#. Then I admitted myself to a hospital. Though I was a self-admission, they still put me on a mental ward. They took my shoelaces.  I left after 3 weeks against doctors’ orders (weight 108#), then the doctors there refused to see me privately. I fight with myself constantly.  My diagnosis is AnorexiaNOS. Now, I have developed diabetes (yay! [sarcasm]), so I’m limited in what I can eat. That gives me an  “excuse”.   I’m an American living in France since 2014.  My French is passable. I’m married.

Desperate for similar stories,4,suzv3k,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/suzv3k/desperate_for_similar_stories/,3,"This might be a little odd of a case since I myself have never met or even heard of a person that is the same as me regarding food.  


So basically to get straight to the point, I stopped eating normal food at the age of 2-3 out of nothingness, from one day to the other. I have since then not eaten an apple a banana or whatever else popular food there is. The only food I eat is either bread with little variations in what I put on it (only butter and sometimes cheese) or unhealthy stuff (for example a small variety of candy). Throughout the years as I grew up my parents dragged me to basically every possible therapist we have in our area from which non of them could really help because I didn't know myself why I didn't eat which is why I couldn't tell anyone what the problem was.   


Nowadays when I'm once again pressured into trying to eat something out of totally understandable reasons, I cant do anything but look at the served food but not eat it or even grab it in most cases. If however I manage to actually get it into my mouth or even down my throat I immediately throw it up again.

Maybe I’m looking for validation, maybe I just want to share this with someone because I can’t tell anyone I know. I have had disordered eating my whole life. I have always been on a quest to lose weight. After I had my baby a couple of years ago, I was put on a ton of meds for depression that made me gain more weight than I imagined possible. I’m finally weaning off them and starting to lose again (the healthy way). 

But to the point of this post, I have always been so obsessed with weight loss and dieting and changing my body, that one of the only things that “turns me on” is weight loss. I see a before and after picture of a celebrity who has lost weight like Adele or Rebel Wilson for example and I get sooo excited. Honestly l masturbate to these pictures. Pictures of people I know personally who have lost are even better. Guys, girls, it doesn’t matter. I am normally a straight female attracted to men. I also get turned on looking at the numbers and seeing how many sizes or how many pounds people have lost.. even if it’s me. Every pound I lose, every bone that I start to see, I get turned on. 

I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this or if I am a freak. I just feel like I have been obsessed with weight loss and weight and numbers for so long, that it’s changed my brain and my wants and desires. 

I looked into kink and fetish forums to see if anyone like this has been shared but so far can’t find anything and that makes me even more self conscious.

How do you stop binge eating alone?

What to do when you binge to not make it worse?

She is also taking no steps to see a doctor and get herself looked after as she “gets worse” My eating disorder is screaming and competitive, but I’m also very concerned that she has watched what I’ve done; seen how the same thing more or less worked for me for weight loss, and as a result isn’t taking her surgical recovery seriously because she seems to be determined to keep dropping the weight. I’m concerned I’ve triggered something in her too because our entire lives our relationship goes back and forth between supportive and caring, to like weird periods of one upping one another. Thats never been this disorder for me, but I think it might be what it is for her unconsciously. I feel awful for thinking that but the timing is bizarre, that suddenly she finds out my weight and THATS when her “pain” suddenly increased so much she straight up couldn’t eat. I don’t know.

I was gonna tell my parents but I don't think  anymore, I think if I start explaining mental illness to them they will just dismiss it and blame it on irrelevant stuff

sorry for the vent, didn't wanna tell the whole world about it but no one knows me on here so why not 

thanks for reading. anyway how was ur day?  ((:",1644631970.0

Confused on wether I belong here or not,0,sqkpsm,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/sqkpsm/confused_on_wether_i_belong_here_or_not/,2,"I'm 15, physically female but I'm genderfluid. For some insight, Ive been diagnosed with Clinical Depression and just recently got diagnosed with ADHD, I also have extreme bouts of insomnia and an addictive personality. I started having BD when I was around 11, and my obsession with my weight slowly showed itself through the way I tried to cover my entire body with certain clothes, or wore tight things to look thinner. Since around the start of quarantine though, it started to manifest itself through my appetite. I began to not let myself eat for hours and hours until eventually I would eat something small before I fell asleep. Or I'd drink juice, or water, or some chips, instead of eating a full meal. I'd watch documentaries about weight loss and the journeys of plus sized people through things like gastric bypass or overcoming their own BD, or I'd watch stuff like 'Supersize vs Superskinny', to sorta persuade myself out of eating. Whenever I'm on social media and I see someone who's unnaturally thin via Photoshop, I feel this sour ugly thing in my stomach and it makes me anxious. I go days without eating real food and then binge eat a ton of things in one night, only to feel so guilty about it afterwards. Whenever I order stuff and try it on, it looks fine, but then when I go out anywhere, I can't bring myself to wear it cause I think I look too big in it. I'm always pinching my skin back or angling my body in the mirror to see how I'd look if I was thinner. I have this ""If I just ignore the hunger pains for a bit this will all go so much easier"" mentality. I get so anxious about my hip dips, or my thighs, or my arms that I feel genuinely sad, and it gets so overwhelming I wanna cry sometimes. What sucks is that I used to love food. I like watching it be made, and I like the descriptions of it, and I like the way it tastes when I've gotten so hungry I can't take it anymore. But I can't stand how I feel after eating, I just feel guilty and lazy and big. I weighed about 140 lbs in 6th grade, I weigh 119 now, and I still keep feeling like I need to lose more. I feel this odd satisfaction when I notice that my waist looks thinner, or I can see some of my ribs, or my thighs look thinner, and it makes me feel giddy. I know it's not supposed to, cause I lost it in an unhealthy way, but I can't help it. It also never lasts, and eventually I just want to keep losing more. I'm scared that eventually I'll lose so much there will be nothing left. I tell myself that I'll start eating healthier once Im thin enough, but I feel like that's a lie. Maybe it's because of my mental illnesses, cause I also started self harming when I was 11 as well. I just keep denying that I might have an ED, because it feels so overwhelming to have to acknowledge that, and I don't want another issue to add to my already messy mental state. If there's anyone who can give me some advice on this, or could maybe explain if I do have an ED, or I'm just overreacting or something, I would really appreciate it.",1644646423.0

This isn't about me, it's about my 9 year old little sister, we live in a very strict middle eastern household, and this little baby gains alot of weight by eating normal amounts, so obviously she isn't over eating (yet) but, she gets emotionally and physically abused when she is caught eating other than the times that were scheduled for her (which is a tiny breakfast, and a couple spoons of lunch and that is it, she will occasionally be allowed to have a chocolate once every two weeks or so) recently this has caused her to eat excessively behind the family's back. I am really really concerned about her, I did everything I can to fight the off of her but I was called things like: ""Dumb"" ""oblivious"" ""arrogant"" ""look at your self first"" and so on and was also physically abused when I tried to step up for her, so that's obviously not a solution...

I've been suffering with what I believe is obviously some sort of eating disorder that has gotten progressively worse over the past 3 years from when it started.

Let me start by saying I am a professional Chef. I LOVE food. I'm so passionate about it. I love cooking it. I love feeding others....but when it comes down to eating, not just my food but any food anywhere, I struggle.

It seems that food just makes feel nauseous. Makes me feel sick. I don't get physically sick but it makes it impossible to eat. I eat one or two bites and I am FULL and miserable and nauseous. It's not certain textures or flavours or smells.. it's all food. I can and have gone up to three days with maybe a piece of toast or something along those lines and that's it. I have consistently lost weight. Over 35 pounds In last year. 7 pounds in just the last week. I don't think I'm fat. I KNOW I'm underweight. I WANT to eat and I know I have to. I just can't. Has anyone struggled with this? I am new to ED'S and I'm just trying to get an idea what I'm dealing with. I drink shakes when I can to get calories in, but they are too expensive to use constantly.

I kept eyeing the scale, tempted by it. I finally stepped on and watched the numbers. Thoughts raced in my mind. I dont think I lost weight, well I dont look like I did. That sorta've thought. Well I finlu peaked at the number's. 20 pounds I lost that much in less then two weeks. I'm so close to my gw, I am excited that I'll finally be pretty and be happy. I wasn't super big on quitting this. But, seeing the weight I lost is fueling continuing this. 


Sometimes I wonder why I do this. But I always snap back into my thinking. I think the worst reason I do this is because I want to be noticed by someone. I know if they found I do this they would be upset and tell my parents. I sometimes don't feel as my reason to doing this is valid. Which makes me feel as if I don't deserve to eat. I feel sick by my reasoning, because I want to be pretty and thin and I don't think I deserve it. 

I tell my friends I haven't hurt myself since I was 12 (three years ago well soon to be once I turn 15 this year) but I still continue to do harmful things to myself. I cut my knuckles so much they can't be cut anymore.

Are treatment centers just support groups and re-feeding/teaching people how to eat regularly? That doesn't seem like it's a true method of help seeing as so many relapse after all of this...

Slowly going downhill with everything (Rant) TW mental health,3,so2f9j,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/so2f9j/slowly_going_downhill_with_everything_rant_tw/,2,"Rant Section 1/back story: This past month I’m be doing a lot better than normal. My anxiety and tic disorder are reduced. My depression finally feels manageable most days, and my binges have been less frequent. I’ve gotten better at forgiving myself after binges and still choosing to fuel my body with food.

Supposed trigger: My best friend hasn’t been at school for a little over two weeks. I called and texted at least 4 times a day, to get no answer.

She finally called me back on Friday and said she was just diagnosed with depression, and is having a depressive episode. She said she is having suicidal thoughts and to not tell anyone, She never talks about her feelings so this was quite alarming. On Saturday I hung out with her the whole day and she said she felt okay for the first time in a couple weeks. I’m glad to help in any minor way possible.

Present: However, since being told this news I find my acid reflux is flaring up from even broth. And my tic disorder is worsening again, along with my anxiety. I’m tired everyday and don’t have the energy to cook. I’m not eating enough, as I’m barely able to eat anything. I feel physically sick when I look at food and I don’t know what t do. I cant focus well in class and I spend the day thinking about my best friend and calories. I’m cold all the time again, and feel dizzy more often than usual (I have vertigo). 

I honestly didn’t think it was stressing me out that much, at least consciously. I think I’m handling it well, especially having gone through similar myself. But.. seeing as that’s the only thing that changed in the past couple days it’s likely the cause. 

Perhaps even worse the urge to binge is gone completely. Although binging isn’t great, overall in my week I would have enough calories when I did.",1644374538.0

How to find joy outside of Food?,2,so0by3,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/so0by3/how_to_find_joy_outside_of_food/,0,"First a little bit of Backstory/Context:
My ED started when I was 23, which is kinda unusual I know. (I used to have some disordered tendencies throughout my teenage years. But never to a worrying amount). 
I am now 25 (student) and in therapy for (officially) anorexia Nervosa. Which is well - not that helpful (but that might be another Post worth)- but I am trying my best to still keep the weight gain going. 

My ED was never about weight or locking thin, I think that is a bit more common in „adult ED“. For me it was always more about being in control, proving to myself that I am strong, because I can keep doing x amount of steps, Fasting for x amount of time etc. just keeping up with all the rules that I set for myself. 

I am basically not the typical 16 year old emaciate  girl that cries over eating a piece of chocolate (I avoid certain food, but if I am around people I eat completely normal). 

&gt; If you are here for the question: 

I am not scared of food. Actually it’s the opposite. Food is the only thing that I can think about once I get up. It’s sad, but it is the highlight of my day. I can’t wait for the moment that I am finally eating and once I eat there is no stopping. I basically eat for an hour until I feel completely stuffed. Going sometimes 5-6 times in the kitchen to get more. And afterward I get nothing done for the rest of the day anymore. So far that I schedule my work until I eat so that I can at least get the most important task out of the way.

Every time that something good/bad happens I reward/compensate by (over) eating. Especially food that I don’t usually allow myself (call it extreme Hunger/binge eating).

And I am tired of that.
I just want my day to revolve on something else rather than food or going food shopping (which I basically do everyday. As it again - is an immense highlight for me.) 
I want to find other things to celebrate with/compensate with.

dont read this if you struggle with any of the things above. but if you feel comfortable with it - i really need some advice.

hi, im 17 and ive stuggled with eating, more specifically anorexia, for about half a year now, though ive been ""recovering"" for the past nearly two months. my friend found out and told my parents, they started getting suspicious about everything = i was forced to eat more than i used to. which is great for starting your recovery and living a healthier life and all, but.. i dont think i was ready for recovery. i know i know, i probably would never have been ready, but still - i havent managed to get rid of any of my mindsets that i had while actively struggling with my ed. i thought i did for a while, because i distracted myself a lot or made myself feel better about eating by making healthier, high-protein meals, but the bad mindset has been creeping back in. even worse, my parents have basically forgotten about this whole thing because its been a while since weve talked about it, and they have stopped asking me if ive eaten enough etc.
so now im just in this weird place - i dont want to be miserable again. i dont want to have to lie to the people i love and feel awful and guilty and hungry and weak all the time. i dont want to miss out on more delicious food just to eat one small portion of the same thing every a day. i dont want food to take over my mind again.
but.. i still cannot get the thought of losing even more weight out of my head. at least now i can recognize the damage ive done so far that i had been oblivious to previously - i look way skinnier than before, and i recently realized that ive lost (very roughly) 1/8 of my body weight during all this time. which is bad. weirdly enough though, ""thanks"" to the weight that i have lost, i dont really.. dislike my body anymore. im actually pretty okay with how clothes look on me etc and i dont really want to be super thin and underweight anymore, especially not enough for people around me to notice / worry about. so i really dont know why i still feel such a strong need to become even skinnier. i havent gained any weight back throughout my recovery, but i havent lost any either - which is obviously the point of recovering - my weight has been stagnant. and i really, really hate the thought of not constantly losing weight anymore. its not enough. i am nearly on the cusp of being underweight and it is so incredibly tempting just to keep going. i want to lose more weight, the people around me have stopped caring again, i have every opportunity to fully relapse into my ed. and i know i need to find a way to stop this from happening but its hard to even start somewhere when my mindset apparently hasnt changed a bit.
i downloaded my old calorie tracker again today, which i planned to never do, but i wanted to know how guilty i ""should"" be feeling about my eating. i logged all the food i ate today, which is probably around my daily average at the moment, and it was just over my old calorie limit that i used to eat maybe half of. i havent felt this gross in a long long time, i still feel incredibly sick just thinking about that number. im sure ive gone over the limit a bunch of times recently, and i hate hate hate that thought. i dont know if i can keep eating like this for even a day from now on, i just want to starve myself again forever and ever. i cant handle recovery. i dont know how to stop myself from relapsing anymore, i feel so awful eating normally, i just want to go back. please help me. i dont know what to do at this point. i never thought it would get bad again, i thought it was just a phase and i was over it and it would be easy because ""i was never really sick in the first place"". maybe was wrong.

im really tired tbh. when will people realize eating disorders are not a trivial thing and it affects every aspect of our daily life? it's hard to get out of bed, it's hard to function normally and it's hard to even just breathe. i can't even look at food properly. i cant smell it or even hear about it. it makes me sick. but nobody seems to get it. it affects me so deeply- hinders every aspect of my life. i'm slacking of at work and school and life at home is terrible. my parents don’t ‘believe’ in my ed. every time i skip a meal i have to hear an earful from them. it is so tiring and painful. to be reminded of the one thing i am trying to avoid. i need help- not rebuke. they don’t get it. they keep telling me i am a horrible person for lying to them about eating and they just do not seem to understand why i lie. its because im mentally crippled. its easy to just not talk about it by saying ""yeah i ate."" that makes a cycle of constant pain and exhaustion so much easier. itd be fine if they did it because they care about me, but that's not why they do it.  they do it because they need to be a perfect child for them and do all the work and because me lying apparently makes them feel like they're bad parents. they keep, making it about themselves. when its my body, my feelings, my pain. my friends often do the same.  they don't like how im dishonest and get weird about food and talk about how it's affecting them and makes them feel bad or guilty, always in a very condescending way. life is so hard to navigate as it is, and they make it harder. so inhumane. these people do not get that my ed is mine, and it is very serious, its a disorder and it affects me deeply. its very painful and they don't have a right to make me feel guilty for trying to make it easier for myself. they don't have the right to make it harder for me by making it about themselves. anyone who does that to someone with a disorder is a truly horrible person.   


imagine if someone you know has cancer which is you know- *cancer* and they forget to take medication one time and instead of trying to help them out, or minding your own business you choose to manipulate them and tell them that “you're a terrible person, how dare you miss your medicines? my grandma died after forgetting to take meds, i have so much trauma, why would you do that to me? fuck you.” how's that sound? not so good, right? when someone is on their death bed and you make it about yourself?  i wish people understood this. how much does it take to be kinder to people in pain? ",1644053089.0

Bit of backstory, my mum has had ana and bul all my life and I've been self conscious of my weight since about age 9 roughly.

I think i chose this because i ""wanted an ED to lose weight"" and now im pretty sure I'm doing this for that reason but i don't fully feel in control anymore. I feel guilty if i eat, barely can eat around others, count calories etc.

Is it possible to indulge in thoughts and then accidentally fall into it? I have no need to need control and i just want to lose weight, i feel like that isnt a valid reason. And also when people say an ED voice, is that like a voice in ur head not ur own or is it like another side of you?

im in a phase ig of what would appear as getting better. iim currently gaining weight i think & although id be devastated if it passed out of the UW section on the bmi- (even though its bs), im still not restricting too compensate that much. im not really using many compensatory behaviours but i do still keep certain food rituals etc. 

i am probs stuggling way more than i think. like food is still 24/7 my thoughts the plans too restrict are always cropping up. whenever my eds challenged like eating out & staying away it seems too panic and get worse, but other than that im eating at least maintenance i think and always end up stopping tracking throughout  day because i just loose the reason too. 

i think what i worry is that since right now im not struggling too much compared too other times in my ed, that this current phase wasnt improved though engaging or planning too 'recover' in the sense off WG and less disordered behaviour etc do i even still have an ed like is it still there lurking for the opportunity too grip me again. Is possible for it too quieten for periods of time but like once you've got it you'll have it in whatever form until you commit too a full recovery?  i don't plan on staying in this phase, im just waiting until other circumstances push me down the ed spiral again.  i worry was it even that bad throughout all the different cycles ive been in over the last 18 months if im sometimes able too reach this point of less disorderedness ? and reaching a healthier weight by myself.

I lost about 40lbs after graduating college. I am still considered overweight after the weight loss - and even though in photos there might be a somewhat noticeable difference to others, I can’t see it. It didn’t really happen purposefully or thoughtfully, just a life change between the pandemic, ending toxic relationships, and just changing from college habits to working habits.

I don’t have to be diagnosed to have an ED. I don’t have to be open with friends and family or have my trouble noticed to have an ED. I have always convinced myself that I don’t, I’m not sick enough.

I ate baby food until I was 11 years old and it almost killed me.,25,shdcwn,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/shdcwn/i_ate_baby_food_until_i_was_11_years_old_and_it/,6,"When you’re a baby, you learn how to chew food. It’s like breathing, you just kind of do it. I was never taught to chew food. My parents would try to give me solid food, but I’d throw a fit and cry. So I just ate baby food, only two different types because I was picky and wouldn’t eat anything else: strawberry banana and I think an orange flavor. I only ate baby food and drank milk (literally nothing else) until I was 11. I had to hide it from everyone. I’d lock myself in a room to eat when guests were over, I couldn’t go to friends’ houses for long, I couldn’t sleep over anywhere, I couldn’t eat at school, I hid a lot to eat and missed out on a lot as a kid because of it. Oddly enough, I was a super physically healthy kid. I was quite skinny, but I didn’t get sick or hurt much. Skip to the middle/end of fifth grade, I was 11 years old. The baby food finally caught up to me and my body began to reject it. Anytime I ate it, I immediately threw it up. Drinking milk was ok but it would come up with the baby food when I’d attempt to eat it. This went on for a month to a month and a half. I was deathly ill, like I genuinely thought every single day that I was going to die eventually from it. I was in and out of school for that entire time and missed a total of 2ish weeks. When I would go to school, I’d have to sit in the back of the classroom with a pillow and a blanket and try to sleep and relax because my teacher noticed and felt bad. My family doesn’t really trust doctors so I never went to see one, but I told my school that I did because how do you tell them that you didn’t? They asked me everyday for a doctors note but I never brought one, luckily that was my last year at that school and there was only a couple months left. Anyway, one day I went to McDonald’s with my mom and sister and I decided to try my first solid food which was their French fries. I was instantly hooked. I stopped eating baby food and I became addicted to McDonald’s French fries. I always say that if it wasn’t for me drinking milk for my entire childhood, I may not have gotten as far as I did. Deada$$ I swear by milk for saving me to this day. This eating habit still affects me to this day. Once I find a food that I really like, that’s all I wanna eat and I get addicted to it. I was addicted to McDonald’s French fries until I was 16/17 years old. I found friends who helped me try new things. I’m 22 now and I’ve branched out and I eat different things now, but not like a normal person. I eat the same 9ish things daily and I still fear trying new things but I’m much farther than I was. I’m much healthier now but I still have a very very long way to go as I’m not where I’d like to be at all and I’m still not fully recovered from it all considering the baby food stuff took up literally half of my life. Chewing is still something I struggle with too so certain foods and I don’t get along because of it. I take forever to chew meat, like literally forever and I’m always the last to finish my food when I go out to eat. I’ve been shamed and made fun of for it many times so it does make it harder to progress. 

I want to leave off with a question. 
Is this something that anyone can relate to? If so, I’d love to hear about it as I have always felt like I’m the only one who’s went through something like that and it’s made it worse on me. Not that I wish this on anyone else, but it helps knowing that you’re not alone.",1643665961.0

ive been doing alright for the past month. ive taken some big steps to get back into normal eating, ive started cooking for myself, eating fear foods more often, ordering takeout with my family, having breakfast every day. and i was feeling alright about it.
i dont weigh myself as much as i used to. i used to weigh myself multiple times every day, and even though i havent been able to completely get rid of the habit, i only do so maybe twice a week now. i havent been gaining much weight, even continuing to lose some very slowly, which i know isnt good but i was alright with, seeing i am forced to recover and still havent gotten rid of some of the mindsets.
well, those mindsets really resurfaced today when i was changing and for some reason decided to take a bodycheck. i then compared it to the last bc i took before starting recovery, which was obviously a bad decision. the gaps between my legs have gotten a bit smaller, meaning i had gained fat in my legs. its the tiniest difference, barely noticable to anyone else but me, it mightve even just been the angle. but that broke me down so incredibly much. i sat down next to my mirror and cried and hit myself in the head and felt sick at how disgusting i had become. it completely knocked the wind out of me and i still havent gotten up, im sitting with my back against the mirror, its been maybe half an hour. and all the self-destructive thoughts ive been able to work around for such a long time all just resurfaced.
just yesterday, i had three meals, they were really tasty and i felt very proud of myself. now im already back trying to figure out how i can skip my next meal. it feels like all my progress has been lost. i dont know what to do, i cant handle gaining any more, i cant handle looking at myself, i want to starve myself of any and all nutrition again. i never wanted to feel like this ever again and i never thought i would. but i cant help it and i dont know what to do at all. i cant possibly go back into my old habits, i dont want to have to start from square one. this is awful. i hate this. my head is going to explode.

I am at BMI 21 rn and while I am currently still engaging in some unhealthy habits, I am eliminating them and plan to stay around this weight in the future with healthy eating and exercise. Knowing that he would much rather see me at BMI 27 or whatever my BMI was before is very discouraging, it makes me feel like I can't recover while still keeping my body at the weight that makes me comfortable, as if recovering automatically meant I gotta be in the thighs - chaffing - constantly - out - of - breath body. 

Maybe it's my ED speaking, but I genuinely felt really uncomfortable in my body at higher BMI and I don't think recovering will change that. I just want to settle on comfortable weight.

Hearing from your partner that he finds your body disgusting is generally really uncomfortable experience, although I think he meant well and tried to convince me that I don't have to keep this body with unhealthy behaviour, but he's really a bit dense if he thinks this will work.

I was heavily overweight. At some point last year I hit a very low point and gave in to all the thoughts of self-hatred I’ve accumulated over the years. I started starving myself because I hated my body and couldn’t stand looking at myself in the mirror. I counted calories like crazy, eating less and less every day, even though I felt like fainting. I obsessed over pictures of models with perfect bodies to keep myself on track. 

I couldn’t keep doing it for too long, because it was changing me from the inside. I became depressed, withdrawn and none of my hobbies brought me joy anymore. I distanced myself from friends and family until I couldn’t take it anymore and came clean to my parents. 

I started eating again. I still count calories (I won’t give a daily number, but it’s the lowest limit in the “healthy” range for my body) and I still obsess over those calories. My problem has shifted from not eating almost at all to wanting to eat everything I see until I physically can’t anymore.

I feel like there’s a major difference in how women of color are treated when we have eating disorders. It’s like people do this low key bullying peer pressure thing to try to force you to eat. Obviously that only makes you want to be mega resilient and not. Or at least not eat all the nasty sugary processed crap. 
I recently got into a relationship that truly been the worst decision of my life. He body shames me and bullies me for being thin, although I feel my body is just kinda naturally like this. Yes I am really strict on what I eat and sometimes obsessive but it’s just become my norm for years now. I hate fast food, I hate too much meat, I hate sugar, and just like clean fruits and veggies. Idk what’s so wrong about that? It genuinely is painful to eat nasty food. 
But as you all may well know, to normal people, it’s blasphemy to not love food. 
Anyway he is mega abusive and pretty much believes feeding me very fattening food and alcohol makes it better. I stopped drinking now but for the last 5 months the depression from the abuse caused me to become the very thing I’ve always worked so hard not to - a comfort binge eater. I gained 50 pounds in 6 months. 😢
Some days I do wish I could be normal. Sometimes I see a very buxom woman with beautiful thick thighs and see how her husband looks at her like she’s the sexiest thing ever. Then I wonder why I see myself as overweight and disgusting, when she’s double or triple my size and so many just see her as beautiful. 
I also have this deep fear of diabetes and heart disease and all other fat related disorders. It doesn’t look pleasant to endure. My father died when I was 13 so I just want to be healthy. 
But how can I become healthy without being so obsessive and restrictive?
It consumes my thoughts for hours upon days. I want to focus on becoming financially successful. I’m so sick of hating a body people literally would pay to have, and not enjoying food for fear of gaining weight. 
Is it even possible to heal an ED at all? Especially when you’re a woc and very few people give you any support at all? It’s as if we are seen as just conceited vs genuinely struggling with a mental disorder. I can’t even afford a therapist right now. 
It’s making me crazy to continue thinking about and attempting to manage on my own. I had to come here to try to find support. Idk what to do to be normal. 😖

If you're 18+ and interested in participating, and are not triggered by answering in relation to EDs, please feel free to click the link below! The survey should only take about 5 minutes but your participation truly means a lot to me!

Thanks so much everyone, do let me know if you have any questions or if you've completed said survey :)

Are they the asshole,1,s8z99e,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s8z99e/are_they_the_asshole/,0,"I have An which developed into some other kind of weird and picky eating disorder by now ( chew and spit, Arfid ) Mostly I don’t finish my stuff and throw away a good amount of left over food.. i feel bad about it but just got used to it by now, i try to not waste so much but I just can’t help myself most of the time it has all gotten really fucked up basically. I just have a few save foods which mostly is Joghurt/Pudding or sweet stuff. ive been through so much and feeling hunger, expressing it, getting myself food independently in front of others (or myself), eating in front of others, all huge issues for me.

Anyway,most people around me don’t want to deal with it, making things hard for me, even though I went to a clinic just this year jumping from severely uw to normal weight again and actively searching help. They ignore my struggels during meals. they get food for themselves in front of me when we spend a lot of time together and expect me to just to the same naturally and don’t see the problem. I have to starve though they don’t seem to mind and say I am guilt tripping them when I get tired of these situations (they don’t ask me if. Want something too) already and have to cry or am just frustrated because it happens over and over again because I hoped I’d just be able to have a normal lifafter treatment but apparently it’s quite the opposite well at least I’m not dying as much as one year  anyway i really understand it must be difficult to deal with me and the people just mean well but sometimes I get really mad that they just completely disregard the problem and I just have to suffer so am I the asshole/seeing something wrong or are they really also just assholes and if you have some level of empathy you’d know what to avaid to do pls tell me all I know is I’m tired of this shit and sometimes really mad at 
them how can they do this to me",1642730884.0

Ana and depression flashbacks,2,s8hi18,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s8hi18/ana_and_depression_flashbacks/,3,"I have had anorexia for not that long and have physically and mentally recovered. it was conformed by my therapist, my doctors and my dietitian.

i cant really remember the time that i was in my eating disorder. I also cantremember anything about my recovery. I just remember that i have stayed home instead of going to school but i cant remember what i did, i cant remember what i felt… and that is a horrible feeling.

when i started eating again my family was so happy. I had such extreme hunger that i couldn’t go 30 minutes without eating. I know it was normal but even back then it scared me. It took controll over me and it just made me feel sick and uncomfortable. I told my mom that i didnt think it was normal anymore. but she didnt believe me. I told all my doctors, my dietitian and my therapist but all they could say that it was normal and that it would stop. I told them that it made me feel so horrible, i knew it was serious but no one believed me. i got back to an healthy weight, but it didnt stop. my hair stoped falling out, but i couldn’t stop. I got my period back, but i cant stop! But still no one believes me. No i am binging probably every single day. I feel horrible. i cant describe it in words. 

Today i am overweight and the unhappiest i have ever been. 

not so long ago (maybe 3 months) my therapist diagnosed me with mild depression that was probably caused by the covid situation where i live (i live in a foreign country since amost 3 years and haven’t seen my relatives since 2019). that time i had self harm thought but have never acted on them because i was so scared.

It honestly didnt surprise me. Ever since i can remember i was never really happy. I always felt less worthy, lonely, unlovable, stupid, ugly… ever since i was a kid. my family moving and being in lockdown was the main reason for my restricted eating. 

&#x200B;

well, this happened in the past. two days ago my school got closed and we are in lockdown. 

All the memories are coming back. All the restrictive thoughts came back, all the body related thoughts, the hate the disgust. And to make it worse My depression has kicked in and i have these wishes again. And i don’t know how to handle it. All i can really do is cry and listen to music. 

I don’t want to turn to my mom. Right now she is so happy because i am at a healthy weight and i went back to scholl, meet friends all that stuff. I know she means well but i feel so bad. i don’t want anyone to see me backseat i am embarrassed. i am miserable and i don’t know what to do. I am scared because i doing have anything to look forward to. Meeting my relatives in august scares me, going back to school scared me, eating scares me, not eating scares me….

I'm lost in the inpatient program.,8,s6546v,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s6546v/im_lost_in_the_inpatient_program/,3,"I've been in my first inpatient program now for 12 days. It is a government funded program where I live. I have so many concerns on my mind and I was hoping for some feedback or guidance. 
Firstly we are on the general psych ward. Which means there is 49 general psych patients and 6 of us. This is beyond scary as there are criminals, perverts and many others with psychiatric disorders who wonder in our rooms and  steal our belongings.  Happy they are here for help but why have we been tossed in the same ward? 
As most of you know our Ed's are result of trauma. Once I arrived I was told there is no trauma therapy in the program. This program only interrupts our symptoms and neutralizes our relationship with food. 
I dont know how I'm supposed to leave here with a mountain of trauma still on my plate. 
They have also taken away the body image program as well. Not all of my peers but most struggle with this as well. Great, the two things which are the root of my ed won't be addressed, what's the point ot being here. 
I thought we would be supervised after each meal or kept together so it would be more difficult to act on our symptoms. Nope we eat and everyone goes there separate ways. Making it very easy to hide our symptoms and act upon them.
I'm also type 1 diabetic and we are forced to challenge cafe desserts each week. This means a piece of triple chocolate fudge pecan cake, or a slice of pie and an enormous butter tart have to be eaten at a meal.  I've been told that I have no choice to eat it, even if my sugar reads 15 or above.  I've tried to explain to them that this is going to put my body in danger. They have responded by saying they will make sure I have extra insulin available when that day comes. WTF?? When I leave here I will still be a T1D and never eat 30 to 50 grams of sugar if my blood sugar reads over 10. 
They have told me to put my Diabetes on the back burner for now as I'm here for my ED. 
We are also in full lockdown as there is a covid outbreak on our floor. They aren't testing patients before they are brought to the ward. Thankfully we have all tested negative but the general psych patients are testing positive as they wonder the halls all day and most won't wear their masks. There are a bunch who are anti-vaxers and making it so hard on the nurses. 
We have been confined to our rooms for 3 days now and they said possibly 10 in total. 
I'm already sliding into a deeper depression as there is only so much TV and reading I can do, I don't nap which leaves me alone with my thoughts making my day incredibly stressful. 
Not being able to just walk our normal eating area and eating in our beds makes horrible thoughts race through my mind. What I'm eating and not having any type of movement afterwards makes me immediately think weight gain. There is no activity to counter the food we are eating.

I’m in my late twenties and during the last two years I’ve gained a little over fifty pounds. My story starts when I got pregnant in high school with my daughter. I had terrible nausea/morning sickness and threw up for the entirety of my pregnancy. After my pregnancy I decided to just keep throwing up…I threw up almost everyday for about 11 years. My boyfriend (now husband) have been together for about 8 years, five of which we did long distance. During the pandemic, he moved in with me. Because he was there all the time, I stopped throwing up. Living in a small apartment it would of been impossible to hide so I stopped. And I was really proud. Unfortunately, we leaned a little too hard into the fast food arena and we drank way too much wine. As a result, I’m 50 pounds heavier, going from a 00 to a 6/8. It was the first time in my life that I felt at peace with my weight and free my of my eating disorder. You might think wow, this is great! What a great success story. Maybe if we stopped there. But unfortunately it’s not, my husband is very vocal about my weight gain. And now I find myself slipping into old habits. I recently shared with him my story and my struggle with food. This was really hard because I’ve never told anyone and it was so habitual that I normalized it for more than a decade. Anyway, his aggressive approach is destroying me. I find myself hating myself, hating more than just my body but my entire being. I feel like I’m in this losing battle, even if I lose the weight I feel like I’m already so angry with him for making me feel like the numbers on the scale define me. I felt like I was finally overcoming my ED and now I’m in a worse place than before. It’s like ED 2.0 for me, even been toying with multi day fasting! Just wanted to ask for advice.

I’d like to provide some context before stating the basic issue, I’m 19, female, and am 5’1” tall. 

• I’ve not been in a very healthy relationship with family for most of my childhood and into my teenage years, some abusive tendencies from parents, for a brief time I was in foster care, and later in highschool I was sent away from home for months to live in a youth shelter because of the daily arguments with my narcissistic parents and constant degrading that drove me out of sociopathic tendencies into meltdowns or “tantrums” as they called it. 

• Seeking therapy never helped, as my mom would use the opportunities to drag me through the mud and make herself seem like a victim in front of my “therapists” who would end up agreeing with her and verbally berate me and belittle me. I was only a kid. A teenager. I still cry so much over those times. 

• And I’m now a young adult diagnosed with anxiety disorder and ADD (they keep trying to give me antidepressants and adhd meds but they literally did not help), obsessive tendencies (emotionally, physically, and mentally), and lately have been just so incredibly sad. 

• My weight keeps fluctuating, I was 160 early in highschool, dropped to 135 junior year, and then plateaued at 150 for the longest until I turned 18, and since then I’ve moved in with my older sibling and her binge eating habits plus quarantine have made me lapse into binging. I restricted and exercised often back then, one meal a day was my biggest focus, and I would hoard junk food just to throw it out. 

• Now I am 180 lbs, trying to purge and my body won’t let me, restricting is looming over me, what can I do to break this cycle? How do I stop binging and will restricting help me gain my previous sense of control and peace of mind  back? I feel so lost without the same control I had back then.",1642068813.0
a little bit about my ed,3,s2v3sa,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s2v3sa/a_little_bit_about_my_ed/,0,"I started gaining weight when I was 15, since then only thing that’s on my mind is to lose weight. I stopped playing sports cause my friend were smaller than me. I was insecure about my body all the time. I stopped hanging out with people as much as possible. My friends and relatives used to tell me how I look so much mature for my age. And there were guys in their late 20’s or early 30’s  hitting on me. At that time I didn’t know it was possible to lose weight cause I had never seen anyone go from being fat to skinny in real life. I started getting depressed and turned into foods for my happiness. I started binging every single day with no physical activity what so ever. I stopped studying. I went from being A grade student to failing my exams. I was gaining more and more weight without even realizing it. After 2 years, I decided to diet and workout and finally lose weight. I started waking up at 4am just to workout and I was following every diet I saw on YouTube but every diet ended up with a very bad binge. Instead of losing weight, I ended up gaining some extra. Every night I used to look at my pictures from when I was skinny and cry about how I let myself go. There wasn’t a day where suicide didn’t cross my mind. I also found out I had hypothyroidism. So then one day, one of my cousin told me how I hated the idea of eating when I was in middle school and was literally built like a twig. That made me think if I force myself to hate food again like I did in middle school and don’t eat, I’ll lose weight. So I started starving myself and the more I restricted the more I started getting obsessed with food. Then again this whole cycle of not eating for days then binging for weeks started. I struggled with this for 2 years and my weight was fluctuating so much. I was 148lbs and 122lbs in the same month. And talking about my life in general, it was miserable. I used to skip school all the time. I hated everyone but mostly myself. I had no hobbies and only talked to strangers online. And talking about my education I have no idea what did I study after middle school. My brain was never there. I used to daydream all the time and just recently found out it’s a mental illness called Maladaptive Daydreaming. Anyway, after my binge session started getting out of hand I started purging. I was bulimic for 2 months. I used to restrict as much as possible then purge when ever I did eat. I was purging every single day for 2 months from 1-6 times per day. And after that I couldn’t physically continue purging because everytime I tried to, it felt like my organs were gonna come out of my throat. My stomach was bloated all the time and my face was all swollen which made me feel more fat even tho my weight was dropping. All this time I was bulimic, I was weightlifting at the gym. Later on, I decided to eat healthy, eat more protein and lift more heavy. After 2 months I had only lost 5lbs and looked the same which drew me back to ed. No matter how much I try even the tiniest thing trigger me to go back to my unhealthy habits. I can never see myself getting smaller than this. It just feels impossible.

Am I a Fatphobic c*nt?,16,s2kfhz,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s2kfhz/am_i_a_fatphobic_cnt/,9,"Back story about myself, like I’ve dealt with a mother who supported the whole 90s diet culture, heroine chic, telling me once as a pre-teen that I should be less than 100 pounds which is insane. I personally in my early to late teen years was apart of pro-a*a communities on tumblr etc, I used to binge, starve, fast, diet, work out until i passed in exhaustion. 
I’m older now, i’m wiser now, i eat to satisfy myself, I work out inconsistently but, I don’t put pressure on myself to reach some sort of goal weight like I used too. To doctors and the BMI scale I would be considered overweight for my height, but i don’t really care. I try to say away from the scale because it might trigger me to relapse. 

My current problem is now, I have friends who are larger than me both in height and weight and I just observe what they eat and to me it’s a lot. I know that people eat different amount to sustain their body types but sometimes they makes comments on what I eat and they like “you eat so little” “you eat like a pigeon/baby” but if I commented on their weight/eating habits i’m very much sure that they would take offense to it. Like sometimes we will be eating together and i go for seconds and there’s nothing left because they’ve eaten it all, it just gives me this sense of frustration because I’m finally at a place where I want to eat, I want to get a second plate and i’m dealt with fat fucks who eat up everything, and it lowkey kinda makes me want to relapse back to the time when all i had was water for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Like is this stemming from dealing with food scarcity as a child, because I grew up poor and never felt like I had enough. Am I just projecting my ideals of body standards onto others based on my own insecurities? Am I just a fatphobic bitch?
I know that fatphobia is wrong, that people eat for their own body types but I can’t help but think “wow, you eat a lot” and i find myself mildly disgusted and angry even though I know i shouldn’t feel this way.

First time hospital appointment nerves,2,s2ryqt,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s2ryqt/first_time_hospital_appointment_nerves/,0,"Hi, I’ve recently been referred to an out patient eating disorder service at a hospital after some doctors appointments and assessments from the primary care team. I guess I’m just nervous and unsure about what to expect. I want to get better but I’m not sure I want it enough or that I’m in a good enough place mentally to be able to deal with the stress of having to keep up with appointments specifically to talk about weight and food I feel like maybe if anything that will just encourage the bad behaviours. 

I’m also nervous that they’ll weigh me I guess they kind of have to. But I’m more nervous about them saying everything is fine because I’m just on the cusp on being underweight by around 3 pounds but ‘healthy’ by bmi standards. A large part of me does want to get better but being told I’m healthy and everything’s fine will just set me back so much because it’s taken a long time to be taken seriously by the system for my mental health. I just feel like a lot of the questions they might ask I’ll likely be really indecisive and torn because as much as I’m fighting it and pushing myself to get help I do feel good when I manage to restrict to the level I want to so I guess I’m just in two minds.

If anybody has any experiences especially in the UK of talking to ED specialists and kind of how they work I’d appreciate it. Specifically how do the doctors deal with a person who is I guess on the fence about getting better. Probably not the best way to phrase it but I hope that makes sense.

This was kind of equally me asking for advice but also ranting sorry about that. I’ve not included many details about my specifics and don’t have an official diagnosis but the closest fit would be anorexia (apart from the bmi but that’s not extremely reliable as we all probably know)",1642053039.0

Bulimic behaviors came back which had been latent for many years. I’ve been eating disordered forever and I just want to learn how to live without this.

I’m realizing I may never fully recover as this has been a mental condition that developed when I was very young. I’m so close to giving up on my recovery. It’s brutal and after three years, some things have gotten better but really it’s my eating disorder cycling through symptoms and behaviors. I try and try to recover but my eating disorder is here to stay. It’s so hard to wake up and choose recovery every day when I have this monstrous disorder anyway. I have goals in my life that I want to pursue but it feels like the only way to really eradicate my eating disorder is to kill myself. I won’t kill myself but when I think about having to live my whole life with this bullshit, it’s so tempting. I want to recover. I really want to recover but I’m starting to question if that’s even possible.

Thanks for letting me vent. What can we do to curb this feeling of recovery defeat? How do we stay working toward a recovery that might not even happen? How do we keep fighting this?

i feel like part of me is ready too move on 
if you will. try and improve myself and my life and engage and try at life again. ive felt like this for a little while but am still scared too lean into the idea and really give 'recovery' or something like it a proper go. all ive been doing since xmas is trying too restrict and 'failing'. 
my mind feels split af. im changing my mind from one extreme too the next. for instance i just spent two hours researching what would be an extremely restrictive diet and planning how ill start it too all of a sudden thinking maybe *big big maybe* im kinda sorta ready too recover ? 

 i dont feel at this particular moment im using restriction too numb my emotions or as a choping mechanism- i think right now my main reason for continuing restriction and clinging too my ed is so that i can reach my lower weight and then feel 'readier' too recover. as it will also  be more physical. since also im eating around maintence daily even tbkigh i attempt too eat xxx and fail. its like my body is just rejecting restriction again. but im still being vegan??? 

idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best",1641953793.0

I ate what I could and it's been 10 hours - my head is still spinning a lot when I get up and I am a bit dizzy, I have a brain fog and my legs feel weak. 

My bf talked me into going to visit my doc tomorrow. She has ""sick hours"" for patients that are currently in sick state, and I'll be visiting her as a sick patient, along with people who have, like, flu or elevated temperature.

I don't know how I should approach my GP tomorrow. Is it even ok for me to come without making an appointment? Should I ask her for a blood panel test? Should I just ask her for a sick leave for few days so I can stay at home and rest? How should I adress my bulimia without it sounding weird? 

I have psychiatrist but the soonest he can see me is next week. I am also scheduled for daily ED recovery program, but it starts next month. 

Did anyone go through something similar? I am scared that I am gonna faint again when I am home alone and hit my head more or something. I am just not sure how my doctor can help me in this situation.

UPDATE: I ended up honestly telling her what happened, she totally blew me off and told me this is matter for my psychiatrist and not her. Even refused to sign my sick leave documentation for past two days, despite the fact that I stayed home due to fainting, which is physical condition, not mental.

Do you think (although its different for evryone ofc)
that ur ed could be simplified into one thing (mainly
restrictive im talking about with this example)? 

like i think i just tried too kinda sum up why i restrict
into a sentence and i wonder if that at its core that is what a restrictive ed is. (for me at least.) - I dont mean this sums it up for everyone. 
 
for instance i kinda knew the answer but i wanted too see what google results came up with when i typed in
""whats it called when you dont want too eat because
youll feel too much"" and ofc AN came up as a top result.

and ik that eds are complex mental illnesses but when we invalidate ourselves over little things i feel like this gives me perspective because sometimes i feel like having an ed can come down too a 'simple?' thing. like not wanting too eat because you wont be able too numb ur emotions. idk if this is making sense. using that example like what other reason could that result in besides from an ed. thats surely not a normal thinking pattern or that of a dieter. is this making sense?  

thanks for reading lol i hope this kinda made sense.",1641906501.0

Advice please!!,1,s0q7a8,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/s0q7a8/advice_please/,1,"Hi everyone, I've come here to try and get some advice on how to deal with my roommate. 

As someone who's been dealing with eating disorders my entire adolescence, I can spot the signs a mile away, and my roommate is very, very obviously struggling with an ED. She weighs her food, notes it all down in myfitnesspal, uses her treadmill 24/7, and talks about her body (feeling bloated, fat, etc) constantly. I've tried to talk about it with her a few times now and each time she just flatly denies that there's any sort of issue at all, and obviously with EDs it's not something I want to push because I know exactly how stressful that can be. 

The trouble is that it's been so long since I was in the stage of my ED where I was in denial that I just can't remember how I would want someone to bring this up with me. That, and the fact that all of this has been immensely triggering to me. Like seriously triggering. Before moving in here I'd gotten to the point where it wasn't something I was thinking about every day, but now I no longer have that luxury. I'm starting to worry that I might have to move out, which is obviously super annoying and sad. 

I've managed to persuade her to go to therapy, but the only thing she's told the therapist she needs help with is anxiety. Should I tell her I think she needs to tell her therapist about the ED? I think that's the most important part of this - getting her to confront her issues with someone who knows what they're talking about. Orrrrr, I could email her new therapist directly and tell her all the stuff I know my roommate won't bring up but needs to be addressed. That's sneaky I know but I worry that if I don't she's just going to sit on these problems and they're gonna end up taking me down with her.",1641837748.0

There’s a lot that goes into this. We’re both virgins. I’ve had 4 relationships and a few sexual experiences that never led to sex due to my Christian beliefs. But I know how I get turned on, how to please myself and the way that I’ve coped with not having sex up until now was through masturbation whenever I get too horny from sleeping next to her and cuddling her every night.

For her, I’m her first boyfriend and now husband and she’s never had experience pleasuring herself before marrying me and doesn’t know a lot about how to turn herself on or allow someone to turn her on.

On top of this, we’re both black, but her mom raised her to only like people that aren’t black. Also, she’s a gym rat and is kind of OCD and is a control freak over food and compulsive exercise. She grew up really really insecure about her body due to some childhood trauma caused by her mother who has eating disorder tendencies and borderline personality disorder issues that she then passed on to my wife (mainly the eating disorder tendencies including a love/hate relationship with food, her body, and exercise).

She also doesn’t feel comfortable being touched near her vaginal area and tenses up whenever my hand gets close. We’ve tried letting her lead my hand, but the problem is we’re both busy a lot and when we get downtime and can cuddle and kiss, she usually doesn’t want to kiss, and likes to be on a specific schedule where she might decide to get on her computer and learn coding techniques after we eat and watch a movie/show and will sit on her computer while watching at times. If I ask to cuddle or show affection, she might sigh and say she’s not into it and just prefers to laugh at the movie with me or find new shows together. Which I also enjoy. 

She goes to bed early and wakes up super early to go to the gym. So the night routine would be about making sure she eats light and does whatever she needs to do so she can have energy to wake up at 4-5 am and go workout for 2 hours before coming back to see me off as I go to work. And sometimes that means not making out since that might cause her to have to stay up a little longer and end up falling asleep with me instead of staying on top of things so she can get up earlier. This process repeats daily except on Saturdays when I’m off and sometimes we don’t end up getting to kiss then either. So I tend not to ask to kiss much anymore and just cuddle her while we sleep at night since this is the only time we can actually cuddle.

She also had a hard time allowing me to compliment her and call her beautiful, pretty, sexy, or any flirtatious words, because she really doesn’t think so and is not used to being comfortable with her body as it is and is always trying to manipulate it and change it.

I usually don’t mind her habits, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t find her habits to be sometimes really annoying because it feels a lot like there’s another person in the relationship (her body and routine). It feels like it’s so important to her that she’s willing to focus really hard on it and not so much on building intimacy with me.

The last factor is that we got married super fast after dating for a year, no ceremony or nothing. And it felt rushed because we didn’t take our time with the engagement and felt pressured by our premarital counselor that was faith based instead of clinical based. So ever since then, that’s been a factor as well. 

These things combined have put strains in our communication and ability to have emotional intimacy because half the time I’m trying not to be viewed as an enemy for asking her honest questions about some of her habits in a nice way and encouraging her to go to therapy.

We’re getting better and have been in marriage counseling from a well practiced, empathetic therapist, but the lack of sex has been a concern for us. 

As for her habits, I’ve begun to not say much about it and just let the counselor lead conversations about that when needed and sometimes we get to discuss it by ourselves as a couple. 

And we recently talked about how we can start approaching sex again.

The cravings are strong and I literally cannot sleep unless I eat the thing, I can't stop thinking about it.

dae find that seeing the scale go down sets them back almost- like i get that rush of euphoria for a moment but then am thinking like 'oh, i still managed too loose weight ever after i ate x,y&z' or 'if i still lost after eats at this time or after overeating then i guess i don't need too consciously restrict anymore as much'. and then i gain it back in a week or so get disgusted and sad and start the cycle again with the same 5lbs.
 i am absolutely sick of it. 

i feel so invalid hearing eds (specifically restrictive ones) where seeing the number go lower promotes them restricting further. i sometimes just tend too see it as permission too eat freer as long as my weight stays below the 'uw' section on the bmi chart. (ik its bullshit but its got me in a chokehold ok) & i hate myself for it. i feel like a gross gluttonous non-disciplined person that even that i use as an excuse too eat. like do i just love food too much.

My family noticed it and I every time I called them I was pretty much in tears. I felt very alive but also so ghostly and like I was somewhere else. My parents got very concerned and came to visit me and saw that I looked ""fine.""

I have little motivation to exercise and haven't exercised really at all since I've been home. And my binging has gotten SO problematic. It feels like a habit and has happened about everyday. I got presecribed anti-anxiety medications which have messed up my sleep and I just feel emotionally very lost. I've always turned to food for comfort and so maybe thats why I've been binging so much. I wake up and tell myself everyday that I am not going to binge, but then I always end up doing it. This semester I am going to stay in school, but am going to do an intensive outpatient clinic with a nutritionist, group therapy, and all.

My 2 questions are
1) Does anyone know what eating disorder that could possibly be? Again, I only restrict and purge, but technically i’m not underweight. 

2) Does every ED recovery involve a meal plan? I’m very afraid of meal plans :/ If not, what else would happen during recovery.

My story,8,ruxcs4,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/ruxcs4/my_story/,0,When I was 7 almost 8 my mom moved into the same house as my father which turned into two years of hell that ended when I was almost 10. The abuse between both my parents was a lot to handle at such a young age and I had my brother to take care of since our parents were always to busy with each other to hang out with us. During this time I became depressed which lead me not eating. I would wait until my stomach hurt to eat and then only eat until the pain went away which didn’t make me full and over this period the stomach pain took longer to kick in so I went longer without eating. I didn’t stop eating because of weight in fact I didn’t care about my weight I didn’t mind how big or small I was it had everything to do with guilt. I felt as though I didn’t deserve to be happy with the situation I was in and eating makes you happy. After we left that situation my dad became poor and didn’t feed us a lot but my mom always went shopping when we were at his house and by this point I managed to start eating again and stay healthy but my dad not feeding us lead me to binge eat when we got back to my moms house because we were so hungry and eating all of the food made me happy. I remember making baked goods for my family and eating all of it myself and they couldn’t have any. Over the next couple of years I bounced back and forth between over eating and under eating. It wasn’t until I started counseling that I realized my problem and at the time I was 30 pound underweight. I realized I had a lot of trauma and that none of it was my fault so I began loving myself and now I’m 12 pounds underweight and getting better everyday I hope this post can inspire others to get better because it is possible it can an most likely will be a long battle but it’s worth it and it is possible you just have to want it,1641200355.0

I’m a senior in college and over the past year or so my relationship with food has become more and more complicated. 
As a teen, I struggled a lot with being underweight. It lead to a lot of insecurity and body image issues and cause me to turn to binge eating as an attempt to see myself as more normal or happier with my body. As I got older, I outgrew it. 

However, it has come back in different ways. I now have new cravings to binge eat. Especially fast food, junk food, and sugar. I crave stuffing my face. When eat junk food, I get a buzz. Similar to alcohol or nicotine. It’s like a high. It has caused me to gain about 30 lbs. Since I have always been underweight, this only puts me at a normal/healthy weight. 

What I thought I wanted so badly (to have a “normal” body) has brought up other issues. I now daily constantly trying to suck in my stomach. I feel my stomach fat and my stretch marks on my legs and get an overwhelming feeling that just churns my core. One second I feel horrible guilt, and the next I feel some sort of satisfaction or reward for binge eating. Then it turns right back into guilt. I like the idea that I’ve been able to gain weight because it was so hard to for a long time. But now I feel like I have to hide my weight gain from the people around me.

2 weeks ago i was doing okay. eating alot more feeling
ok about it & maintaining. although i had no plan too
continue this i was accepting how i currently behaved
and my mindset for the moment

christmas was crap lol got abit worse & urge too restrict was massive. ive not been alone at all for about a week now & staying at my friends and i feel so overwhelmed. staying at my friends has allowed me too restrict alot for the first time in 3 weeks or a month maybe and i feel like its just chucked me back into the deep end. i ate some toast this morning and havent felt that uncomfortable about eating food in ages. like 2 weeks ago that probs would have been ok but now its too stressful and since im not home and cant weigh food etc im using more behaviours too compensate. 

halve way thru eating i realised there was some mould on the bread, and my first thought was at least this could get me sick and i could loose weight. mate what. its crazy how easy these thoughts can slip back in after even accidentally restricting or when you don't even realise you've been slipping back. not sure where i stand with my ed at all anymore or if i have one rn. i guess it never rly goes away, i just want help so i can feel validated but dont actually want too get better :(

who i am as a cook comes 100% from my ed & recovery. im a really skilled chef and baker but nobody takes it seriously because of my eating disorder. nobody wants the anorexic chef but im the anorexic chef and my food is fire and i don't sacrifice anything for taste. i hate the stereotype of the skinny chef. people are always judging cooks off their bodies and their relationships with foods and its stupid. any other cooks on here?? lets break this stigma

I’ve had an eating disorder since high school, and fought with it for many many years (28f). It’s been a big goal of mine to talk with a nutritionist about losing weight in a healthier manner. Someone to hold me accountable while slowly losing weight. I used to teeter between not eating for days and obsessing over every calorie. I was put on a waiting list for a well renowned nutritionist clinic back in June, and had my initial appointment in November. I told the nutritionist what my goal was: losing weight steadily over time, until I got to the weight my body worked best at, which is 60 lbs lighter than I am now. I want to be held accountable and have milestones so that I don’t regress into my bad eating habits. Not looking for a date in mind to get back to that weight, just whatever works best for me. The nutritionist cut me off and told me that no nutritionist or medical professional would ever help me with that goal, and it broke something inside me.

I’m just not sure,2,rrq0u2,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/rrq0u2/im_just_not_sure/,1,"Currently a 25 year old female.

When I was in HS, I was 150 pounds, always active and playing sports. Going into college, by the time I was a senior in 2019, I had gained essentially 100 pounds putting me at 250. Since then, I have lost about 50-60 pounds, which is nice but I don’t always think it was in the best way.

I feel like I gained so much because when I was younger and living with my toxic step mother, I felt guilty about eating in the house. I was hiding food. And always hiding when I was eating. Even after being out of that house, I still find myself hiding when I eat a lot because I don’t want to be judged. I hide eating from my husband because I’m afraid of him judging me even though I know he literally won’t…

I have developed an unhealthy relationship with food because I feel guilty about foods I typically love. And often keep finding myself binging on food throughout the day. And as I eat it, I feel guilty, but I literally can’t stop and I feel bad about eating. Then to cope, I continue to eat. And I’m just not sure what is wrong because I have punched and hit myself in the stomach because I’m so unhappy with what I’m doing but I don’t know how to fix it. Last august, I was at MY OWN bachelorette party and we went out to eat and I had a panic attack in the bathroom because the thought of eating in front of people make my sick… literally was with my own best friends…

I hired a personal trainer to help me lose weight and it helped but I just couldn’t control the eating.

Did/Do I have an eating disorder?,1,rreorx,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/rreorx/diddo_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,5,"So, throughout my childhood I was able to maintain a healthy weight, but after a while I began to receive comments from a family member stating that I was getting fat and needed to lose weight, despite my doctors saying that I was the proper size for my age and that going a few pounds over was fine, as long as I keep it in control. 

Anyway, I tried letting it go and eventually I did. I was a pretty happy kid for the most part and almost always ate 3 meals a day and never skipped until I reached age 11 or 12. Around that time I became more self-conscious about how I looked, but l'm not exactly sure why...I really don't understand what caused it all, but one day I just got in my head and thought that I shouldn't eat anymore because I thought people would judge me for it. Like when l'd go to school, I'd just force myself to think that people were making fun of me for eating and so I stopped eating like I normally would to make all those thoughts go away. I just really dreaded eating in front of people. 

Instead of eating healthy meals, I would only eat potato chips or soda ONLY throughout the entire day and I did this for months until I noticed that my clothes were getting looser. Then I weighed myself one day and noticed that I had lost a significant amount of weight, but it didn't bother me. I actually like the fact that I was losing weight because it made my legs and waist look smaller and it became so bad to the point where my ribs began to show. 

Eventually, my significant weight loss began taking a toll on my health and I started feeling more dizzy, developed diaestive problems, had shortness of breath, and started to feel more weak whenever I tried doing normal activities.  I thought |  was fine though because I went to the doctor about it multiple times and they always told me that nothing was wrong with me, but it definitely feels like there's a problem because I've never had these problems before this started. 

 So here we are today…Over the years I have tried to fix my eating habits, but I don't think I'm doing very well with that.  I was so used to ignoring myself when I got hungry that now I forget to eat sometimes.  Like l'll eat maybe once or twice a day now but l'm not like how I used to be because usually l'll just eat one large meal and just skip for the rest of the day or just eat small portions of food just to say I've ate something.  It's really frustrating too because people just don't seem to understand that I'm trying and only see it as me being a difficult person, but the way I feel is more complex than they think.  

Anyway, I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder nor do I know if my situation qualifies as something of the sort, but if someone could offer me suggestions or advice on how I can fix myself, please do so.  Thanks!",1640801892.0

I am a junior in college now, and have since recovered, and back at a normal weight. I feel as if I have a healthy relationship with food and exercise. 

However, what concerns me, is that recently I have randomly been feeling shameful about my body and self-image. It’s hard to describe- like a cold feeling in my stomach that will randomly pop up and make me feel really bad and insecure about myself. It’s very odd because I don’t usually feel that way about myself. It will just pop up randomly and it makes me want to engage in eating disorder behaviors again. 

I am just curious if anyone else experiences this and how they go about these feelings? Also, if anyone has any explanations on why this happens, that would be much appreciated as well!",1640584063.0

It isn't that this period has been totally horrible and hopeless, it's just involved a lot of letting go and dealing with things in isolation from other humans (which in many ways has been a blessing).

I've just purged again. I waited too long after binging, so it was really gross. I feel so swollen and I crave emptiness. I just want a break from my body for a bit, not in the dissociating sort of way, but I just want to lighten the load for a while while I sort out some of the heavier things in my life rn.

I'm already finding comfort in preparing the structure of restriction that I know will take place over the next couple of weeks.

I don't hate myself, I just want some parts of my body to die off/fall away, to match the changes that are happening inside.

Anyway, I know that this time of year has been a struggle for a lot of us.

Please be well and take care of yourself, even if the way that you're doing that right now doesn't look particularly pretty.

 my family & i have gone away for xmas & are staying in an apartment. for the weeks leading up too xmas i started too come out of a deep place in my ed & sort of made my peace with not wanting too restrict/ engage in ed behaviours as much and things got a little better.

took sf w me, although when i was home i didn't rly eat them and felt comfortable being more adventurous with my food & eating. but now im away its like i panicked and started engaging in ed behaviours and thoughts of restriction r much stronger. maybe because it feels unfamiliar or i feel too out of control. 

i cant rly eat vegan when im here just vegetarian because its way too complicated for my family too cater too- which i get and am ok w doing. my family made random comments about my eating habits or my previous ones ( like oh remember when u used too weigh ur food etc) which i trued too shift topic v quickly cause they have no clue ab my struggles.
 my brother hardly eats (not ed related but idk) & my mum expressed her concern. it all just makes me sad and mad and want too restrict even more & now im sat here when everyone's eating breakfast on boxing day and cant even eat/ join in.

i just found christmas much much harder than i thought it would. which makes me kinda sad. part of me is happy that i want too restrict more again but idk. this whole thing is just messed up. i dont like christmas anymore. 
i just dont know what too feel anymore and i feel guilty over eating when others diddnt and eating more than others. they all hardly ate which makes things so much harder.

anyways ty for reading <3 enjoy ur holiday period & sending luv",1640537353.0

Idk, at this point I have to admit my bulimia is starting to be kinda prominent again. I am purging like ten times a week, lost over twenty pounds in two months (although I am still on the higher end of normal BMI), and despite the fact I am used to this considering its been going on for over ten years, even I am becoming worried. 

I am looking over all my resources again. I do have an option to go to daily treatment center or to get hospitalized, both for free, I'll get medical leave from work, my bf is okay with it, the only downside is the waiting list which I would be on for like two months. 

It's just...I've been there two times already (to both the daily treament and hospitalization) and while it helped for several months, I always relapsed. 

It feels kinda pointless to put my life on hold again for something that failed twice already. I know third time's is a charm, but, like...i feel discouraged and I'd rather just let this go on and see where it takes me. Sounds morbid.

Another thing is that I am ashamed to be going for the third time already with no visible progress. It's like spitting into doctor's faces. 


My head is a mess right now - I keep going over the email I wrote out to them, contemplating if I should send it.

been going through a peroid of eating kinda normally and not using as many behaviours for about 3 weeks- a month. makes me feel v uncomfortable and unsafe but im trying too be kind too myself. its not recovery i dont think and ik im just waiting and begging too want too hardcore restrict again. idk what this uncomfortable middle ground is i hate it here.

 i am meeting my best friends who i havent seen in months tonight and part of me rllllly wants too restrict until then but i also want too eat and fuel properly so im not anxious and moody lol. i think mayb its cause theyre the only ppl who know ab my struggles and i feel pressure too *look* the part. stupid ik. but part of me feels guilty for confiding in them w my struggles and then not struggling as much for abit. 

 im just struggling with the motivation and feeling allowed too eat.  no one in my family knows about my ed and i feel so alone too either keep myself accountable or go thru this alone. i just need some support too make the *actual* right decision bcos im so torn.  my brains just split into 2 man i hate this shit.

Unavoidable Relapse,1,rl9iiq,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/rl9iiq/unavoidable_relapse/,2,"I've been in recovery from bulimia since March of 2020, but I just found out my [now ex] boyfriend is a 33 yr old lying, cheating, manipulative predator who was messaging young girls sexual things and I feel so so so sick to my stomach.

both times i started my day with iced coffee from dunkin’ because it makes me feel full for a while for whatever reason. i restricted for a while, maybe having a couple snacks in between then ate dinner. i ate until i was full at dinner but then like an hour later my stomach started feeling weird? it just kept making noise and then i started to feel hunger pains. i have really bad anxiety and ofc thought i was dying or something lmao but i know that wasn’t it. but it kept me up for at least 3 hours the first time and 2 the second. 

i know stomach acid has an effect on an empty stomach and you shouldn’t drink coffee first thing. did that have something to do with the pain? like how long does affects from stomach acid last? or was it just from restricting so long? 

2. i don’t usually eat breakfast but recently by like 9:00am with no food i get super dizzy. any suggestions on how to prevent this? you’re probably like just eat but like is there anything else i can do because it’s happening in class😭

3. i think (?) this is a side effect from restricting but what’s up with the nausea? is it normal to feel super nauseas when you haven’t eaten or after eating? and any suggestions on how to help it? that is like the worst feeling for me

When I was younger I was insecure about my curves and when I tried to lose weight I would gain more. Eventually the slim thick trend came and so I was able to accept myself and embrace my body. However, after barely a year of my new found confidence I experienced a huge weight loss. I lost 20lbs w/o trying and I didn’t know what to do. My health suffered and my confidence plummeted as a result. It was embarrassing cause everyone noticed and pointed it out i was the skinniest I’d ever been(113lbs and I’m 5’7 for context) In 2021 I finally was back at my ideal weight (134lbs) after nearly 3 years of fluctuations. I felt good happy and healthy only for my weight to dip back down after my 21st birthday.I was stressed out around tht time and had trouble eating but I managed to keep my weight at 125 only for it to dip to 120 and now I’m teetering between 117 and 120. I don’t kno what to do it feels like I can’t control my body. I can’t gain/loose weight when I want to and I don’t even trust my eyes when I look in the mirror. When I try to eat I feel anxious and my appetite is nonexistent sometimes. I’m scared of losing more weight. Any advice on how to manage this?

When I eat outside of my apartment the food literally makes me want to vomit. I promise I’m not exaggerating. I can eat a bag of Doritos (my favorite) in my apartment but if I were to drive to a park it would literally make me nauseous to the point where I’d want to vomit. I’m not uncomfortable with my weight, in fact it’s scaring me that I’m losing too much weight (none of my clothes fit). So it’s not because I want to lose weight. It has nothing to do with my appearance. I literally can’t eat outside of my “comfort zone”. Which means I’m eating once a day. Sometimes if I’m anxious I can’t even eat in my apartment. I feel hungry & fatigued everyday. I can’t keep doing this. Yes I’m in therapy, yes I’ve told my therapist and he literally never brings it up. What is wrong with me?!

 May - July fell into a binge restrict cycle whilst experiencing extreme hunger due too heavy restriction for about 5 months. 

then Aug - Dec fell again into a mix of v low restriction, b/p, over exercise all, eating maintenence. all of it id experienced Until December.

But now for the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is fail restriction & basically binge, only purg!ng a little, a few times. 

ive probs been eating around maintenance, but still mainly vegan- ignoring timings and not rly measuring any food or cal counting which i feel so guilty for loosing even more control.  

my body is disgusting, im more depressed than ive ever been but i dont think thats soley from my ED; although the depression is fuelling it. 

 ive been ignoring my body and how it looks, not weighing or stressing over it only stressing over the loss of control and 'discipline' and my ed 'disappearing'.
 
now i feel like all im doing is eating & have little desire too restrict - waiting until its all too much & i can see again how quickly i can loose it all and get back too my lw. 

so uncomfortable with everything neither option seems appealing i keep telling myself if i reach below my lw by 31 jan (my bday) i can get help.

 i feel like i need too just get bored of eating and b repulsed by it until i can hardcore restrict again. i don't want to recover but i'm holding hope that by mid next year i will have gotten much much worse so maybe i can start then. ik u shouldn't wait till that point but i cant imagine rn wanting too let go of this life ever. 

i just want too shrivel & wither away. be left alone too starve w no responsibility for anything outside of existing. i hate this life. pissed i cant restrict as well as i used too and even more uncomfortable that part of me doesnt want too right now.  fml",1639403601.0

Prolonged stomach pains?,3,resv2k,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/resv2k/prolonged_stomach_pains/,7,"I know I can't ask for medical advice but I'm just curious if anyone else experienced this? 

For context, for the past couple weeks? months, maybe? I've been purging anything I eat, & other times I try to restrict as much as possible. I've dropped a significant amount of weight recently (just as early as this past July/August I was still in the 160s, whereas as of today I've hit 140.3lbs), & much more recently I've been far more restrictive. 

Maybe 3 days ago I remember eating extremely little (probably <200 cal.), & I don't remember if I purged. But the next day or so I didn't eat at all. Then yesterday I ate some of an apple (shared with my pets that can eat it), I had a cup of yogurt, some Goldfish crackers & 2 small waffles leftover on the counter from breakfast that day. I 'binged' that all (my 'binges' are usually 'normal' portions/calorie counts for meals & hardly surpass even healthy amounts of calories, but I always eat it all at once) in one sitting & immediately purged it. 

Usually I let myself by with probably a net of 200-300 calories a day, even if I purge I know I can't get it all, but it's still very restrictive. 

Anyway, I think not eating a single thing & purging the only thing I did eat after 2 days just took it out of me, because when I woke up today I felt like death. I woke up with a dull sharp pain in my stomach, & by the time I got up to use the bathroom it was shooting through my whole body, especially in my lower abdomen, almost mimicking period cramps. 

As I write this the pain seems to have subsided for the most part, but it's so consistent & painful. Today, I'm not going to be purging; I know one more day - hell, a lot of more days - of this starving isn't going to kill me, but I can't be starving myself that badly. So far, today, I ate about half an apple, a peanut granola bar, & a glass of water. 

The thing that drove me to write this post though was because of how persistent the pains were? I started with the apple to help & admittedly ate it very slowly, but probably by the time I had 5 pieces of it (about 1/4) I felt essentially no change in the pains & I gave in & ate the granola bar (reluctantly, because why is a single tiny granola bar 170 calories?). 

I sipped the water in between bites of everything & I'm hoping that helps me feel more full. I just still feel hungry but in a way that I don't want to eat. I could barely stomach eating the food I had today, but I'm worried that I've gone from my old habits of binging all day earlier this year, to now I'm forcing myself to eat something, anything, because I just feel that shitty. 

Do others experience this really bad pain too after restricting like that? Because I've had bad hunger pains that make me wanna throw up, but those go away pretty fast after a bite or two. These pains feel like they shoot through my whole abdomen & make me feel sick & weak. Just curious if this is common with heavy restriction, because I've never felt them this bad before 

(Little update before I post - I think the pain has gone but it did really suck)",1639327671.0

i feel like i *feel* so much more when im restricting or purging etc even if its mainly shitty feelings and thoughts.  but the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is basically binge eat or eat normally with no compensatory behaviours. 


i just feel so numb & my life so bland that i dont rly care right now too cry over it anymore or too franticly restrict the next day.its not like this doesnt make me hella uncomfortable. i just feel nothing no good or bad emotions just uncomfortableness & worry my ed is slipping away. not caring enough on either side too continue restriction or eating normally.


i cycle alot thru different phases like p/b, pure restriction, over excersize, lax abuse etc. 
but rn im not rly doing any of that for the past two weeks and im scared my ed has gone or smth. 
ik its not rly true- the thoughts r there, theres still things i refuse too eat and behaviours i use. 
i feel disgusting & am planning on how too loose the weight but i just feel Nothing rn & its causing me too not care enough about if im gaining etc.  


is this just part of a cycle do other ppl w eds kinda sometimes go too a point of remission?? idk what too call it.

only my house is triggering af, my brother hardly eats (not an ed thing just forgets or cant be bothered/ isnt hungry).  My parents arent here alot so theres no one too keep me accountable at all. at every minor inconvenience im just like okay time too fast tomorrow instead or keep leaning on restriction again too cope. 

i was planning too eat dinner and my food for day when me and my brother had a huge argument & now im back too wanting too restrict cause im down again. 
on top of that he told me hed not eaten anything yet when i asked him which made me even more guilty bcos id had bfast AND lunch already which i spent hrs trying too justify. 

why is this shit so so hard. i feel so lonely but im also scared af ill continue eating this way into the new yr. 
it feels like every 'counter-action'  i do or behaviour i dont use or food i eat, my ed slips away more. 
Im so scared it wont come back or ill Never feel the need too get worse again and im not ready too recover or anything im waiting for it too get worse.

tried abit, hid rest in bag.

for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours & thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot/ or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged- but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. 

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it.

It got really bad when I was around 17 years old I went from 100 pounds to 92 took a toll on my mental health and I was not confident. I should mention that I’m also 5 ft 2 in so already pretty petite. It took a few months to get to 102lbs (this was the weight the doctor said I was supposed to be at for my age and height). I spent three days a week exercising while drinking 2 to 3 Ensure’s each day/every other day along with vitamins and trying to eat as much as I could. After I got to my accomplished weight I was finally happy my body felt healthy and stronger. The phases would come and go but I would always stick to my routine so it never got worrisome. For the past 2 to 3 days I’ve been feeling a loss of appetite ofcourse I am still sticking to my routine so again I’m not worried but I am curious as to why it even started happening in the first place. Now that I’m approaching my adulthood years I wonder if it’s an eating disorder or just the fact that my body was/still is changing.

im pretty sure it was below maintenance but since i couldnt purge all of it the 'typical' way; ive started working out more again, sp for the last hour or so i was working out, and the second i start too actually enjoy it and not only do it too feel ok after what i ate and less anxious. like i was kinda doing it cause it felt fun- i start feeling guilty becaude this should be for punishment & compensation- not for me too enjoy. so that sucks. now theres literally nothing i can do. ive been feeling guilty for sitting recently and found myself trying too always be moving. 

i cant watch things for long unless their related too ed's, food, weight loss, or i feel there a good use of my time (like they're beneficial too my ed) so not even that i can escape too which used too be the biggest coping thing for me. love that.

Eating disorders are sometimes ALSO metabolic/endocrine disorders and not JUST psychiatric ones: story of a friend,13,r8ry54,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/r8ry54/eating_disorders_are_sometimes_also/,6,"Hello,

**TL;DR;** Binge eating (and other eating disorders) is sometimes ALSO a metabolic/endocrine disorder and not JUST a psychiatric one and restoring metabolic health can help tremendously with recovery

A friend of mine suffered from extreme BED since she was 13. This, among other things, caused her to be morbidly obese and she also developed PCOS.

She was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward twice (self-admitted). Despite all the therapy and meds, she was never able to control the disorder, because she just could not fight against the urges to binge.

I myself am a final year medical student (Central Europe). After talking to her, she told me that she gets these intense cravings randomly throughout the day. I thought, well, maybe we can tackle this from the metabolic side (in addition to her going to therapy).

So I suggested she should talk to her physician in order to get a prescription for metformin (insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic medication) and an SGLT2-inhibitor (causes around 100g of carbohydrates to be lost via the urine every day). The metformin ER (2g/day) + the empagliflozin (12.5mg/d) helped with the metabolic dysregulation by counteracting the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is also one of the main factors that causes overweight individuals to be very hungry, because the stored adipose tissue (fat) cannot be tapped into, because the high levels of insulin inhibit lipolysis (fat breakdown). This causes people to become very hungry quite soon after eating.

Furthermore, I cleaned up her diet. We settled on a paleo-like diet with slow-release carbs with low glycemic index (e.g. beans, peas, sweet potatoe, other veggies), plenty of good fats (olive oil, butter, avocado), and protein. We removed fast-spiking carbs (e.g. bread, pasta, potatoes, etc.) and milk products (as whey and casein -the milk proteins- have some endocrine activity and can lead to inflammation and cravings due to their synergizing effects on insulin as well as IGF1 -a hepatic growth factor).

Well, low and behold, after 2 weeks of ups and downs, she did not have one single binge in over 5 months. Her weight loss is in the image. Currently, she sits at 75kg and is still losing and binge free. (The story as well as the screenshot below is of course posted with her permission).

The therapy (targeting the psychological side of things) was ineffective until also the metabolic/endocrine side of things was addressed -after which both components worked synergistically.

While binging often has a large psychological component (addiction, stress-eating), there is also an endocrine/metabolic/internistic component (e.g. intense craving due to metabolic dysregulation) -which is often neglected by many doctors.

I just want to share her journey as well as encourage some of you to talk to your physician to tackle the metabolic side of things, because, if the *physiological* craving is eliminated, controlling binges is a lot easier.

**Moral of the story:** BED has sometimes ALSO a metabolic/endocrine component and not JUST a psychiatric one. And this metabolic/endocrine component (i.e. *one* of multiple factors) could either be a contributing cause or a disorder-maintaining consequence of BED. Nonetheless, whether cause or consequence, it can be targeted with specific medical interventions, which should/could help tremendously with recovery (esp. in subjects whose eating is triggered by hunger pangs and not purely due to stress/coping, etc.)

Bonus: Instead of the empagliflozin, even more effective would be a GLP1-agonist (e.g. liraglutide), which is both an insulin sensitizer, slows stomach emptying (--> less hunger pangs), as well as activates POMC-neurons in the hypothalamus (--> greater and prolonged satiety and greater energy levels). In the near future, she will likely switch out the empagliflozin for the liraglutide. An excerpt of a study regarding the use of GLP1-agonists in BED is shown below.

I’ve always been really skinny because my parents are skinny too, it’s just in my genes. 
It’s not because I don’t eat. I used to eat even more than the other kids I just couldn’t put on weight. And having all the teachers and classmates pointing out my flaws and how skinny I was made me start obsessing over my weight and I started struggling with body image. 
One day, my pe teacher told me that I was too skinny to play a game and that I had to eat more because he could see my bones and that I didn’t look healthy. 
That day, I promised to myself that I would do everything I could to gain weight.
I started eating large amounts of food everyday. Sometimes too much that my body couldn’t digest it and I would end up throwing up. Which made me feel like a failure and I would force myself to eat even more the following day to compensate the weight loss that throwing up could have caused. 
When I saw I wasn’t gaining weight I started self harming because I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to put on weight and that was the only thing I cared about and I was failing. I couldn’t even bring myself to leave the house because I didn’t want people to see my body. 
I’m better now. But I sometimes relapse on the habit of forcing myself to eat large amounts of food every now and then.
Thing is, when it comes to eating disorders, I have only heard of people who want to be skinny not of skinny people who struggles with body image because they want to gain weight. Is it an eating disorder?",1638645976.0

restricted this week successfully after not rly doing it 'good' for a few weeks & gained weight too a number i was uncomfortable with. 
diddnt weigh for a few days whilst restricting bc i had not enough time in schedule too weigh how i need too like before hand so wasnt sure how much/ if i lost/ gained. 
but felt like i was eating unsafe/ too much during those days even though i was tracking & was restricting. was halve sure i gained and halve sure i lost. but just begging too just b under what i considered uncomfortable / dangerous weight. 

so today when i could finally i did and was relieved & elated too see i lost way more than i thought i did. - too a num ive not been in a month or so. 
then i seem too always fall back into a pattern of when i loose weight part of me thinks its ok too eat so i fucking did & i ate mainly chocolate and crap. 

restricted in a sense but stopped tracking cals after abit but im sure it was around my maintenance ?  

spent the rest of the day every time after eating resetting my fucking fasting timer & then after the initial freak out & guilt of what i just ate went away id eat again and reset again. 

cried basically the whole afternoon and night lol and tried too excersize abit but just too tired too !! (so now i feel like a fake and guilty coz i cant even compensate good enough ha) & used unhealthy coping mechanisms after but now im just lying here 10pm tears sticking too my face feeling like such a faliure sad little piece of crap ha bcos not only did i unsuccessfully purge, excersize &  restrict. 

im paranoid & sad af that tomorrow when i weigh i will have gained and that number will be further away again & ill be forever stuck in a cycle of reaching a gw, giving in & eating, loosing control & gaining & then spendjng weeks just trying to get back control & too a manageable comfortable weight. 

i feel like ive ruined everything and my body will just balloon overnight. 
 like all these cals will turn too fat since i'm just lying here in bed not utilising it for energy. 

i feel too guilty too sleep but i'm tired af and too tired too workout which makes me feel guilty clz if i was rly unwell i would do it regardless until it felt safe too stop. 

so nlw im just lying here dreading the weight gain of tomorrow and having too look in the mirror back too square one. 

is this even a normal ed thought pattern. is  anything even wrong. this is fkn horrible. will i gain? is it possible since it was cal dense and right before sleep. my heads going to explode and i just want to bloody sleep.

Every single time my mom, sister and brother said I was getting a bit too “round” my twelve year old self wanted to cry. So I started taking smaller portions on purpose, even when I was still hungry. I lost a bit of weight but still felt horrible about my body. Part of this was because I’m trans, and I didn’t realize that gender dysphoria was part of what I was feeling. So all the bad feeling i had about my body regarding my gender I just associated it with my size because that’s what everyone around me seemed to care about and was what I understood about myself at the time. I remember this one time at a family gathering, the first thing my aunt said to me was that I had finally lost weight and I looked good. I think it was at that moment we’re eating became something that started to really bother me. If all I needed was to be skinny to look good, then fuck it. So I ate less and less over the years. At first it wasn’t so bad, it wasn’t healthy but it wasn’t severe. Then came quarantine. Literally this one comment changed the way I saw myself and how I ate. A girls I knew said that her chest became smaller since she lost weight. Immediately then my trans guy brain said hold up that’s another reason to stop eating. With online classes alone at home, I ate nothing for breakfast and lunch and ate enough at supper to not look suspicious but that’s all. When I made new friends, came out to them and felt happier, i started gaining a better relationship with food again. All was going well until about two months ago, one of my best friends kills himself. All of a sudden my whole mental health came crashing down. I started drinking a lot, felt horrible and made a lot of bad decisions. One of those bad decisions was starting to purge the food I ate. It started off eating normally but throwing up my supper. Then I stopped eating breakfast and brought smaller lunch portions to school. I check every single item to see the calories. Now I just hate eating as whole and dread every single meal.

basically just a brain dump/ rant lol sorry.! 

does anyone else find them selves harshly judging others even though you disagree with the thoughts
. 
ive just started university & my old friends were aware of my struggles, i diddnt feel much of a competition among them because no one else really seemed/ told me they had struggled with it too. 
it sounds bad but it was 'my thing' yk. 

since starting uni in sept things have been getting worse, & they are much much worse than how i was when i left my old friends in school in june.

now im in uni and made new friends, none of them rly know and ive not directly made any suggestions towards having an ed. but if you knew i struggled w it and observed me my behaviours r clearly disordered lol.  
 
anways yday me and 2 of my friends were talking about r certain topics and sharing some things related, and one of them briefly mentioned they once dealt with an ed & body dysmorphia, nothing more than that, literally just saying those words. 
and oh my god has it sent me running back into restriction. 

and then all these shitty thoughts towards them starts. tbh i wouldnt have guessed or thought they had struggled, theyve never displayed any thing concerning and believe me, i have been observing the shit out of my friends at lunch and the way they talk ab food ha. for no reason i think its just an ed thing we do w most ppl. so i would have never guessed bcoz they seem too have a great relationship w food etc. 
So in my brain the way they said it made it seem like they had had an issue with food/ or body image but were just labelling it as an ed.  

i feel so guilty like im trying to invalidate them cause they seem fine and like if they had rly dealt w an ed they wouldnt have said it like that. 
but ofc i dont rly want to invalidate anyone coz ik that eds are so mental. but its just really really got too me.

i think what i rly am upset by is that i just feel like they threw the word around, and that she just brushed over it like they were a simple struggle and now theyre just absolutely fine and recovered. 
when i know how fucking torturous they are & feel so misunderstood in this illness.
 i never feel like i can talk about it w ANY of my friends unless i know exactly what too say and what topics im going too cover because i just want them too understand!! and too paint the right picture. i feel so protective over it and now so so competitive like i have too prove w out saying anything that i've 'actually struggled' w an ed. 

even though the person is lovely & would never try too upset me or feel competitive w this, i feel such a need too prove myself and restrict better bcos i 'actually struggle' but also am trying too look as normal as possible. i said nothing after so they dont know but idk i just feel so bad for invalidating them sm just about appearance and from what ive seen them do. 

i hate this so much but am also weirdly grateful it happened bcos its pushed me deeper into my ed and is just fuelling it so much.",1638458128.0

sorry its kinda long ! i just dont know how too feel & explain shorter i need advice so bad. 

ive been struggling for just over a yr now, and since September this yr just going between feeling in the depths of my ed & heavily restriction, too feeling alright with my food, body & life. Therefor not feeling the need to cope with restriction or engaging in ed behaviours as much. 

within weeks of eachother
i feel like ive just been in a cycle of severely restricting;feeling the worst i have mentally and physically. too my mood improving and being able too ignore the ed voice & eat fairly normally with less compensatory behaviours. 

feel i came out of a very depressive slump Throughout the last 2 weeks, during which i was restricting & engaging in many disordered behaviours, then last week during trying to restrict i could feel my mood & depressive state starting to lift & found it easier too eat etc, found myself justifying it being ok too eat instead of the opposite. 
but then engaging alot in purging too compensate. 

since about friday last week i've been eating basically normally, not rly restricting & not purging in any way & only engaging in a few behaviours (like timings, eating w certain utensils, kcal checking) mostly without even realising-which tbh i am glad about, bcos otherwise id feel way too uncomfortable feeling & acting so 'normal' so quick. 
i did become vegan in sept too make restr/ less stressful.  

ive not really been listening or heard the ed voice as much Which makes me think I have just been putting everything on. 
like i have chose too push this voice more & more in my head in the past or really just myself telling me these things. 

I partly know this isnt true and what i've felt in the past was valid & real. but i just dont understand how i now i can so easily 'decide' too eat normally & use less behaviours. feel less scrutinising of my body and stopping to weigh myself as much.

I feel uncomfortable that i feel so normal & okay. 
I do in general find it hard too accept feeling happy; prefering the comfort of depression- using this too fuel my ed. but since my mood/ mental state has improved it just feels easier too eat. 

im comforted by the fact that i'm sure by the end of this week ill sort of 'snap out of it' i guess. & realise what ive been doing & all the guilt will sort of catch up too me. but also afraid that it wont and ill just have made the quickest ed recovery in mankind. 

like this is just such an uncomfortable position it feels. i'm not actively trying to recover but also not engaging as much in ed behaviours and eating normally. i'm sure when my mood dips again ill go back too restricting but i feel so guilty, like i was able too take a 'break' from my ed as soon as my mood improved. and therefor it was never there in the first place. I feel like my brains just constantly split into 2 parts & sometimes i just have too much control and can choose too let myself eat like this and justify it like a normal person. like how is this the same person who a week ago had so much confusion & turmoil over too let herself eat halve a fucking sweet potato. what. 


i just always feel like as long as i think my behaviour & eating is disordered then i'm okay and safe. not too far gone. 
the only reason ive been okay with eating normally since friday with no compensatory behaviours is that i've been telling myself its a binge. when i know its not but feeling/acting normal is just too much too accept.  

was any of what i felt in the past even valid, too have said i had an ed?

I feel like such a liar, as if i would just push myself to feel worse too benefit my ed. 

does anyone else ever go through phases like this. 
Is it normal with an ed. 

ik that the part of me trying too grasp on too what ed behaviours i have still been using is in itself disordered but i feel like the only person whos ever done this and been able too have consecutive days like this. 

i feel like ive been faking all along. and ik i wasnt so maybe i just was never as bad as i thought. i dont know. 
maybe when my mood drops again ill realise what i've done and itll all come crashing down lol. 

tysm for reading ik it was long af- i just need help and too know if this is normal among ppl with an ed.

How to go about meeting new people and making friends?

Alrighty to set the scene. Very overweight since the age of about 10, mum died when I was 1 and a bit dad met someone new which I think was a huge part of my life. Whole life was uprooted when I was 6 so no real choice in the matter. Biggest kid in school consistently for p6-s6 was always that one. Around s4 was when the mental side declined. I spent the last ‘best’ years of school basically not talking/interacting with anyone skipping lunch to work on projects, the classic excuse. Never went into the common room avoiding everyone to the point I would sit in the bathrooms for maybe 2 hours most days. Didn't talk to anyone outside of school, no friends from school, no friends from college, no friends from uni now although covid makes that odd. No siblings, no cousins, no family friends. Sounds pretty sad writing it out but here we are. Probably haven't talked to anyone outside of my dad and grandparents for the past 5-6 years at least in a meaningful real engaged way, only course related talk. Obviously at the time undiagnosed depression then losing the weight by not recommended methods, really developing the ed plus the body dysmorphia the loose skin doesn't really inspire confidence. Not the greatest concoction to maintain whatever was there if anything. 23 now and introverted would be the wrong word, honestly just feels sad at this point. Good thing for anonymity.

On the plus side I had the therapy and dietician appointments, and I think it's going much better now. The fear of regression is still there but it's been three weeks since any incident and feels nice.

Main question is how do you go about meeting people after an ed or at least recovering? 

Uni is going, how well not sure so getting a part time job brings anxiety just now don’t want to commit to something and sacrifice the other. As said before almost no interests pretty much lost them all a while ago. Side note I live with my grandparents for university and there both in 60s one is really high risk so covid is a real concern. Any suggestions would be great.

Now thanks for reading this monologue. It feels nice to at least make an effort to change.",1637708009.0

I am very conscious about my weight absolutely hate my body feel like people just look at me and only see my weight (despite not actually being that much Iver weight) and really really want to be skinny (it's all I think about actually)... but the problem is I can't stick to a diet because i can only find happiness through over eatting unhealthy food e.g. burgers, pizzas, chips or chocolate.

It was very bad back then. I had only consumed 700 calories at one point. I can’t say it’s so bad right now, I eat 900-1500 a day which I think is healthy. I’ve lost 30 pounds since then. I was thin but now I’m thinner. I was insecure for as long as I can remember. I always got told I resemble my brother and father. I hold that with me everyday. I never let it go. I feel as though I look incredibly masculine. Femininity is something I just can’t have due to my physical appearance, body language, and mannerisms. It seems so out of reach. I feel disgusting thinking I could be a girl, I don’t deserve to be one. I identified as a trans man for a year, I gave up on reaching femininity. Maybe it wasn’t for me, I thought. I became a little comfortable being a man, but alas….I’m never truly satisfied with anything. My eating disorder sky rocketed Bc I wanted to be present masculine. Now I’ll never be enough to be a woman or man. Not even close. I can’t have either. I live in this constant cycle of questioning who I am or what I like. Am I deserving to even like anybody? I want cosmetic surgery done, that is something I always wanted. A nose job, a bit of lip filler, eyelid reduction….I’ll be happy. I know people always say it won’t make you happy but I want to FEEL pretty at least when I’m also spiraling. I can’t say I’ve been bullied for being ugly, nobody has ever called me ugly. I’ve had a couple admirers. Why can’t I see what they see? I remember having this huge crush on a boy I thought was the embodiment of perfect and he called me cute! He said IM cute?? I can’t see it, I can’t recognize who I am in photos…the mirror and camera. I look so different. You’d think because I’ve been complimented my whole life I’d have SOME confidence but it mean nothing. I want to be perfect. At the age of 19, I’m still highly materialistic and obsessed with beauty. I thought I’d grow to be more mature but I haven’t in that area. It’s funny how a few years back my only wish was to be anxiety free. I couldn’t enter school Bc of my anxiety. Now, I hold all these desires. It feels like I’ll never love my body or face. I don’t want curves, I don’t want a woman’s body. I don’t know, I can’t wear skinny jeans without freaking out. I want to be nothing. I want to be a small ant, a leaf.

Ever since 2 ish years I've have on and off throwing up habits. At first it was unintentional since I felt nauseated so I forced myself to throw up so I wouldn't feel sick. But I found that now it has grown into something else.. Because I feel nauseated constantly like no matter how much or little I eat (now also drink) I feel the feeling and it doesn't go away until I throw up. Like ever since this week I haven't eaten anything without throwing it up. Like it had been pretty mild like throwing up once every 2 days. But now it's atleast 3 times a day. Because I still try to eat bc I feel hungry. I've been losing weight which is causing me to slowly be underweight though I always though I was skinny and I was okay with my qoeght so it never was me doing it bc I want to be skinnier.
It's just my body rejects food. And I've been not really able to sleep properly because I either feel hungry and or very ""sick"".

TL;DR at bottom

I’ve always engaged in disordered eating habits since I was old enough to know how. Beginning of high school I started to take it seriously and partnered up its my gf at the time, we were ‘Ana buddies’ though we never said it out loud. Fast forward and I develop a substance abuse problem, drop out of highschool and find myself in a long term abusive relationship. During this relationship I gained a lot of weight. I couldn’t cope with being abused and turned to snacks. The bright part, I eventually got out. Took his ass straight to court. We know how the system works for abused women. A lot of my evidence was thrown out when my first witness didn’t show to court. Yes, that’s a federal crime. No, she didn’t face any punishment. Her family is made of $$$. Great lawyers. It didn’t matter. I found the start of healing through therapy and…through reverting back to ED habits. It started with a picture. I mean sure, I had thoughts here and there that I’ve gained a lot of weight and it’d be nice to lose it but I didn’t think about it too much. I went to a convention and had a photo taken of me. I saw the photo when I got home and it struck something in me. I don’t know what it was, but once I looked in the mirror after that all I could see were my flaws. It was like 14yo me was whispering in my ear “You know how to fix that…” Details aside, it’s obvious what happened next. I did lose all that weight, and then some. It wasn’t healthy and it was very fast. As I’m sure you all know people loved it! I was all the rage with my friends and family. Comments of how good and disciplined I was, how I was inspiration worthy, look how TINY and LITTLE you are, where did all that beauty come from blah blah. It was fine until I could barely go up a flight of stairs. Nobody noticed, or at least nobody was brave enough to say anything. My hair was falling out, I was tired, bruised. I saw the impact it had on my best friend, my other half, my ride or die. I never asked her to or encouraged the ED life to her. She mimicked. I would have done the same. Seeing myself shrink didn’t matter, but seeing her shrink? Enough was enough. 
I had to chose recovery for US. So I did. 
Here we are now, weight restored, our social media timelines flooded with recovery posts, ED therapist advice, positive mantras etc. 
I’m. Not. Happy. 
I’ve been restored for some time now. In the midst of my recovery I had to stop doing dance because I was weaponizing it to work with my ED. Now I’m pudgy. I hate myself. It’s not as simple as going on a mild diet to lose some of the extra fat from binging because I know I will take it too far. I have thoughts of relapse every day. I browse skinny gossip. Then eat an entire bag of Chinese takeout numb as can be. I live my life in black and white. It’s hard for me. If anybody has read this far, this is a cry for help. I don’t know what to do. most days I can’t find the courage to get out of bed. I know how important recovery is and why and how I need to fight back against this anti fat society. I can’t hold out much longer. I can feel my fat being restricted by my jeans. I can feel my arms jiggle. I feel heavy, sludge like. How can I possibly fight this? I’m scared of the damage my heart has already taken and what more I’ll do to it if I slip back in. Because I know it would happen fast. 

TL;DR 
I recovered from an ED in terms of weight restoration. Now I’m chunky and I’m miserable. I binge a lot. Real binges. I feel it’s all or nothing. Underweight or fat. I’m scared of a relapse for fear of more heart damage.",1636777367.0

For context I used to be 252lbs and lost 50 of those lbs healthy. And I was stuck at 200ish for almost 2 years. And now that I’ve gone down another almost 10lbs in the past few weeks. Seeing that number finally move again, has brought CICO to a whole new level for me. It’s like the little voice in my head is like- little to no calories means rapid weightloss and when I do eat, the voice in my head says throw it up Bc those calories are gunna keep you stuck. And I’m actually excited?? About losing weight and knowing it’s going to come off if I continue. And I hate purging (Bc of all the physical negative side affects, such as chubby cheeks and teeth rot) so my brain is like, well if you don’t eat, you don’t have to purge. Anorexia is the “pretty” route to take.",1636350196.0

I am really worried as I have been loosing rapidly for months on end and feel totally incapable of feeding myself. I won't go into specifics but my BMI is below 13 and my mum is concerned that it's not safe to refeed at home and thinks I should be hospitalised. Has anyone increased at home safely or is it best to be monitored initially in hospital first to medically stabilise first? I haven't had any blood tests or ecg/postural blood pressure monitoring so I have no idea what that would be. I really do not want to go to hospital because I have been before multiple times and they don't even know what to do anyway and I come out traumatised.

For me, I find catharsis in sharing my story and potentially saving others from a life with an eating disorder as I’ve been struggling for over a decade. I am beginning the process of creating a full, evening length work that examines and discusses eating disorders through an artistic lens and was hoping some of you would be interested in sharing your story for research and artistic purposes. I don’t have an interest in basing this show solely on my own experience as that would feel incredibly shallow and narrow-minded.

It is my hope this project will go beyond just a performance and have the chance to develop into a full blown curriculum that helps educators in and out of the dance field learn how to navigate classes with language and practices that lessen the negative impact that contributes to the further development of an eating disorder in students.

I know I have an eating disorder but I’m not sure what. I’m “healthy” looking and have a healthy weight. I’ve never been severely underweight. I’m really good at making myself look happy and not like I’m starving myself at all. Even though everyone knows I don’t eat a lot, no one has ever worried or suggested help. I remember the first time I began restricting, I was 8. I’m now 25 and cannot believe my mind is constantly battling this stupid voice. There’s all these stupid rules in my head. Idk how they got there or when I accepted them as my truth. I just know that I can eat one meal a day and allow myself to eat whatever as long as I haven’t eaten something earlier on in the day. If I’ve eaten, then i only eat safe foods for my meal which is always dinner so that I don’t have to see anyone after eating. Every single thing in my life revolves around meal time and whether I have eaten. Literally everything. I refuse to eat if I have anything important going on during the day so that I feel my best and prepare for whatever life brings at me. The days that I binge (usually around my period time, i might eat more) I hate myself so much and feel so fat that I cancel most plans. I thought I would be passed this by now and suddenly feeling like I can’t live like this forever.  Maybe I am sick enough to get help…. I’m just scared. So scared.

earlier this year i was basically binge eating a lot of junk and fast food. it eventually backfired on me in August. i got severe heartburn & acid reflux (recovered from it in the same month). it was bad enough tho to where i couldn’t eat much of anything, causing my original restrictive ed to kick in. it was noticed by my doctor that my weight dropped pretty quick during that time. she basically caught it before it could’ve actually been bad. i have been on the road of recovery for about 2 months now. i did start off very slow but now i think do eat at what like a “normal adult” would eat in a day. i’m back at the weight i was before everything went downhill. thing is that weight i’m at is still considered underweight. i know i have a very fast metabolism which has caught back up with me at this point. i’ve been able to maintain this weight but i wanted to continue on to be a healthy weight. my issue is that i am slightly scared of foods that would have more calories in them. i’m also in the performing arts so it’s not easy to eat whole huge meals then train/teach. i also live in the fear of repeating what happened in August since i’m still mentally processing it. so i sort of feel a little stuck. i was curious if anybody is possibly in the same position? you could share your story. or if you have advice to be able to eat more & train my brain food isn’t the enemy, that’ll be nice :)

Am I Dying?,10,qgzd84,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/qgzd84/am_i_dying/,3,"Trigger warning: I’m going to be talking about numbers (specifically weight and BMI).

Recently, I had a meeting with my psychiatrist and he seems very concerned that I could possibly be dying. He wants me to schedule an appointment with an internist ASAP to make sure that I am not.

But now the idea is in my head and I am scared. 

I am 18F, 155 cm, 35kg with a BMI around 14.5.
I have been experiencing chronic fatigue, nausea, headaches, dizziness, chest pains, and “episodes” of heart palpitations. Any sort of physical activity (walking long distances, climbing stairs, showering) causes shortness of breath and worsens the before-mentioned symptoms. My heart rate is consistently above 100 bpm, even at rest. I also experience frequent bouts of confusion and mental fog.

I am scared to go to sleep out of fear that I won’t wake up. I am scared that every time my heart pounds it is finally giving up on me. I am scared that the nausea will worsen and the act of vomiting will be too much for my body to take and I will end up dead in the bathroom.

Despite all of this, I can’t seem to stop my ED and the last thing I want is to gain weight. 

Long story short, are my fears unfounded or am I truly at risk of dying?",1635348775.0

I was doing really well yesterday by allowing myself to eat what I craved, and to only exercise what my pre-made workout plan told me to, but my mom made a comment that ""she is a pig"" after eating a large box of leafy green with no dressing or oil, 3/4 of a banana, and a spoonful of Greek yogurt. She is super slim for her age and height (very underweight) I couldn't help but feel awful and thought of myself as a monster immediately, because my brain told me, ""if she is a pig for eating that, then what am I?"" and then a binge commenced.

I am so exhausted. Living like this is so exhausting. I don't even have the energy to bash myself anymore because the thoughts in my brain tire me out. I get triggered by everything, and it's so exhausting.

It gives me ease and comfort & I use and abuse it. I try compensatory methods to then control my weight - excessive exercise, restrict, etc. I sometimes wake up and my first thoughts are on food or I dream about food. I'd have thoughts of eating a particular something when i wasn't even hungry. I'd want to just ""munch/eat"" something when anxious and wanting to avoid facing life/reality/my uncomfortable feelings. My closet was full of various sizes because my weight was always a moving target. It was a vicious cycle of using food to feel better - feeling awful afterwards, swearing off and coming up with a new plan to eat healthy, I'd have great results for a time, eventually I'd compulsively eat, after i was baffled how could i do this yet again. All the self-knowledge of nutrition & strategies to eat right and exercise didn't work. All the years of ED disorder therapy didn't work. I tried umpteen other things: popular weigh & pay programs, intuitive eating, other forms of talk therapy, hypnosis, various healing energy modalities, positive intentions/affirmations, metaphysical means like healing crystals, on and on. What did all this experience show me? That I'm screwed between the ears when it comes to managing my eating and my weight. Sure i could power through and have great results for a time (people would think I had surgery because of how different I looked) overtime, however I'd eventually go back to my compulsive eating behaviors. Finally, when I realized I was out of options and baffled I tried the last house on the block, a 12-step program for my compulsive eating problem. In the rooms i heard people share and I realized i wasn't alone in how I used food to feel better yet my mind and behavior with it was overtaking & ruining my life. I was plagued with thoughts on what to eat, oh, no i can't eat that,  ok, how do i avoid eating that because if I start I’ll eat too much, controlling ingredients…. then overeating and eventually compulsively eating. The big book of AA as adapted for my problem says I have a mind that is unmanageable. I can't “manage the decision” to stop compulsively eating for good and all. How did I know this? My experience proved it. I could have all the reasons to stop (serious health reasons, self-knowledge about myself & exploring “why I eat” through therapy, self-knowledge of nutrition & exercise strategies, job expectations to model good health, etc) was that enough to stop me for good and all - Nope!

I got free from my constant obsessive thoughts around food, eating and weight by joining a 12-step program for compulsive eating. I got a sponsor and worked the steps. By doing that I am now free from compulsive food thoughts and the insane behaviors that would follow. Now, I get freedom from that barrage of food thoughts and weight obsession. Now i have a different way of dealing with life. Rather than turning to the food I turn to the steps, but i had to do the work and get through the steps to be able to start living life that way. I am a gratefully recovered compulsive eater and sponsor. I am happy to share more on my experience for those interested.",1634811347.0

However, whenever I drink, I binge eat. I used to do a lot during uni when I was recovering. However, it’s started again and I can’t seem to have one drink without binge eating. It’s like there’s this connection between both things in my mind and I don’t know how to break it. 


Ive also started blackout binge eating. This is where I get drunk and can’t even remember eating the food even though I know I did from the evidence. I know however the solution to this is not get so drunk in the first place. Although, the problem is that once I have one drink I find it hard to stop. I want to be able to drink socially with friends, family etc without either taking it too far or binge eating to the point I feel sick.

Gym coach disaster,10,qa2f33,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/qa2f33/gym_coach_disaster/,3,"This super buff gym manager noticed me going to the gym everyday and decided to « adopt » me, and is now giving me free 1-1 coaching everyday.  

He is really working me hard, 2+ hours everyday, and I'm worried I'll fall back into disordered habits if I keep it up; He’s obsessed with « sculpting » my body and he doesn't want me eating junk food, fat and sugar (food that I want to allow myself since I have been recovered for 1 year).

This is all very flattering for my ED (being the « chosen » one, basically going through restriction while being held by the hand), but I feel myself getting extremely anxious and I’m afraid I might start undereating just to make sure I don't gain weight for him. 

After all, this experience is so validating for my disorder, and I can’t help but get addicted to the feeling of walking into the gym and having him show me off to everyone around the place. He even let me know about the brand of gym clothes he is starting up, and promised me I would be his model and would get as many kits as I want for free. At one point he whispered in my ear that his desire to make love to me would only grow fonder if I started wearing his workout kits. 

This is just plain disturbing but my disorder is getting hooked on this new feeling, and the promise of this ideal life is slowly taking over all my other priorities such as school and work.

I know that when I've achieved his ""goal"" of body fat percentage, I won't be able to maintain the eating habits I’m currently creating, so I’ll start eating normally again and gain some weight back. As we all know, the guilt I could feel from gaining could put me at risk of spiralling into another cycle of anorexia/bulimia. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this situation, as I am feeling stuck at the moment. Stuck between doing what it takes to access what seems like a dream life, and ripping away from my stupid eating disorder. After all, I do like this man; our personalities really clicked and now we text regularly/increasingly meet up and go for a walk outside our gym hours (not to mention he is incredibly attractive). We have kissed on many occasions and I suspect he wants to ask me out at some point (and I wouldn’t say no). We already spoke of travelling to Australia in 2023 - you get the picture. On the darker side of things I sleep 15 hours at a time due to exhaustion, and I get very anxious about the food I eat - what if I unintentionally eat too much and disappoint this man I like so much?

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 months now (we know eachother for 1,5 year) and I am very happy with him. We both have meme accounts and that’s how we met lol.

He loves me a lot and he continues to show me that. However, I am a very insecure girl who’s had anorexia and a binge eating disorder. We had multiple fights about his instagram following cause he used to follow a lot of girls with insane bodies, a lot of celebirties that were either insanely skinny or had a BBL etc. It made me so so insecure, He ended up unfollowing them (he didn’t want to the first time cause he thought I was controlling) but I genuinely didn’t wanna eat for days if I just realised I didn’t look like any of those girls.

His ex is also very beautiful and very skinny, that also makes me super insecure, I compare myself to her all the time (thought this was worth mentioning) but I have to say it’s getting less and less by day.

Now we watched squid game together and he has been posting memes about the attractive actress in it which just gave me raging thoughts, how does he even know her name? It means he looked her up I suppose, now I’m just on the tip of about to cry in my room cause I just think i’ll never be good enough for him and that I also need to lose weight.

basically kind of screwed,4,q1gyb1,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/q1gyb1/basically_kind_of_screwed/,1,"i posted this and then realized the title was absolutely Not Helpful to what the content contained at all, so i'm reposting it (even with the updated title i'm sure it's not helpful at all, sorry :( )

i'm not really sure how to start this off, so i'll just dump a few things. i'm 16f, 5'4 and a half, and recently weighed myself and saw i was 99 lbs. my mom said that i needed to eat more, and for awhile, made meals for me so i could try and regain the weight. i've always been a bit of a picky eater, but the meals she was cooking for me were ones i liked/was okay with. however, i was still unable to finish them. i do take vyvanse, which apparently lowers your appetite, so that probably has something to do with it. however, when my mom made fewer and fewer meals, i started to fail to see the reason as to why i should gain weight.

i began liking the numbers on the scale, and now i look forward to seeing if the numbers have dropped. i've never really had any hobbies or talents or anything to brag about, which has always made me feel bad, but now i feel like i finally have something to say about myself.

my friends tell me to tell my mom about how i may have an eating disorder (unsure as to whether or not this is true, i feel bad saying that i do even though all signs point to one because i'm aware self diagnosing is bad) and i know that this is a really bad situation and i should tell her so i can try and get help, but it's like i'm addicted to the feeling of knowing i finally have something to say about myself. every morning i'm almost *excited* to go weigh myself, anticipating whether the numbers have dropped even further. as of right now, my weight has stayed the same (\~99 lbs) which i'm not sure how is possible because i haven't eaten in 2 days, and as of tomorrow, it'll be 3 days. the hunger pangs are rare, but when they do come, they're intense. but, when i stand up to go drink water so i can trick myself into feeling full, the hunger disappears completely. this has been happening even before i realized i weighed 99 lbs, probably even for years.

it's confusing - sometimes when i look in the mirror i get scared. i don't look severely underweight at first glance, but my ribs stand out when i inhale and you can slightly see the ridges in my sternum on my chest. my back is a lot worse, though. my scapulas and ribs are a lot more prominent. my hipbones also jut out a lot, but then again they always have so i can't tell a difference in how they looked before and how they look now.

for some reason, while i know i should tell my mom, i just... can't. i do have diagnosed anxiety and adhd, but i'm not sure if that's what's holding me back, or if it's just shame or embarrassment. it's hard to describe this accurately, but it almost feels like i'm a drug addict confessing to my parents about how i think i need help.

the problem? my dad is *really* stingy with money. it's not as if we're poor, we could afford treatment if i needed it, but he's obsessed with saving money. he constantly keeps watch over our credit card payments and is always asking who bought what (i have two older brothers). he also always thinks i'm exaggerating. not sure how to word it, but an example would be how keys were falling off of my laptop. i asked if i could go to the apple store to get it fixed, and he refused, asking if my mom and i had ""even bothered to try to do it ourselves first."" we had, but he always assumes the worst of everyone. and he's constantly saying i don't need my glasses and that i was just making things up for attention. even then, he hasn't spoken a word to me since september 2nd, so there's that.

my mom is also influenced by him, whether she realizes it or not. she's definitely a lot more lenient, and i love her, but she's really controlling. you can tell she likes being a mother, that she likes having her children rely on her. and i get the brunt her care, now that both of my brothers are in college while i'm still in high school. she wants the best for me, but she's easily swayed by my dad's opinion. i feel like she's a shell of who she used to be, who she was before she got married to my dad.

i bring up the topic of my parents because i'm not sure they'll let me get treatment. as i said, my dad's obsessed with saving money and fixing things himself, so i'm sure that if i tell my mom, she'll tell him, he'll think i'm exaggerating, and if i keep up the ""act"" my mom will just make more meals for me which i can't even eat because i'm constantly nauseous.

i'm not really sure what i want this post to be. i guess it's more of a vent than anything, but advice would be appreciated considering i'm dying and there's literally no solution to this

Anyone else feel sucked into the eating disorder depression?,12,pwuwit,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/pwuwit/anyone_else_feel_sucked_into_the_eating_disorder/,1,"I’ve [25F] struggled with eating disorders all my life. When I was a teen I didn’t eat until I was a certain weight. When I gained weight I would throw up. I was never “too thin” though always on the last number for a healthy weight for my height. Depression from breakups or the death of my grandfather who raised me and in my eyes was my father were the only two instances where I “naturally” became underweight. The depression was awful of course, and both circumstances I struggled with alcohol abuse and self-harm….but boy was I skinny. The doctors notes telling me I was underweight, the comments from people in my life, a mixture of I look great and I look too thin we’re almost orgasmic. The depression was crippling but the being so skinny was addicting? I’ve always managed to keep my life together due to childhood trauma and fear of not succeeding and being poor. I have a masters degree and make 114k a year at 25 years old because I never stopped working so hard, through the losses, the alcohol, the anorexia, and self-harm. I never stopped working. I’m a high functioning piece of shit. 

Fast forward and I live the “dream life” I’m engaged to be married in two weeks to the love of my life. He’s so wonderful. We bought a 5,100 square foot beautiful home in the suburbs and want to start a family. I am healthy 95% of the time besides constantly worrying and obsessing over my weight. 130 pounds 5’4. I’m so disgusted every single day. I don’t drink much anymore but when I do after a long day there is something so incredibly comforting about the MESS! I’ll sit in my car and drink tequila and convince myself to stop eating. Listen to my favorite sad music, sometimes even go to the bathroom, throw up and cut myself in discreet places my fiancé won’t notice. Fantasize about my bones sticking out again and being so thin I look sick. It’s so incredibly comforting and I feel like I’m home and this is right and where I belong. I l love myself and have hope.

Then it’s the next day. I know I have to work, not drink, eat, and be healthy and it sucks. I hate myself and I’m fat and ugly.

Am i alone in thinking this. feel like ive faked my ed entirely because I ate an unsafe food.,10,pwflwc,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/pwflwc/am_i_alone_in_thinking_this_feel_like_ive_faked/,2,"I suffer from quite a restrictive ed, and i was hungry so i thought baking would make me feel better & i could be around food too- win win. 

I adore autumn & cooking So part of me wanted to actually eat the autumn things i was baking- but ofc my head is screaming at me not too. 

My head was telling me i was strong enough to resist  the food, all what it usually would say; demonising the food. And i was ok with that- happy, because it means i was 'strong'.

Id offered one to everyone and then they were sat there for an hour.
 i had been debating wether i wanted to have one myself & if it was worth all the pain i knew would follow, but in the moment it seemed manageable and alright and like i should just eat it and enjoy it like i would have years ago. 

So I had one. AND. made the dinner id planned for myself. I couldnt finish it but I kept myself distracted until i was completely done eating because i knew the thoughts would become loud enough soon and honestly just Could Not Be bothereeed!!! to deal w them. 

I ate that cupcake and a bit of a brownie id been thinking about all day and it wasnt even worth it. 
i could only enjoy it for about 10 seconds in the moment and what followed certainly was not worth it. 

I just proceeded to compulsivley excersize until 1am and sobbed about it until i got too tired to be awake. And did *everything* i could think of to counter act. 

The thoughts of worthlessness & that id made my entire ed up, that i was a fake and this is why all my friends hated or would leave me. I felt like id binged and was disgraceful. (i know its not binging though)

That i didn't deserve to be alive or to waste anyones time because id lied to them and caused so much drama for no reason & that i was a disgusting manipulative person and all these horrible things just would. not. stop. 

I feel like its not even worth maybe in the future trying to recover if i decide too. i feel like i'm stuck this way. 

Id been having a pretty tough week w my ed and MANY big life changes in general.
And in the past (pre ed), food would b a big comfort. - Not to the point where it was a problem, id always been lucky to be v skinny so it never felt an issue.
But yrs later its turned into the enemy completely. i feel like ill never enjoy food again. 

And even worse im still convinced i faked my ed and that someone who was really ill would never have ate what i did. 

But then part of me still rationalises it & thinks that maybe im not lying because they wouldn't behave so strongly and have so much mental pain after eating it. it would be normal. 

Its such a trap. I dont even know what i think or feel anymore i just regret it enormously. 

Does anyone else ever feel like there faking or made it all up if they do something like that. 
Have I made my entire ed up??? or am i like just too deep in to even realise. i don't even know anymore. This is so so lonely. 

Sorry for the huge ass paragraph lol. Thank you so much for taking the time to read/ comment.

pretty sure it’s going to get bad again,3,pwkp35,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/pwkp35/pretty_sure_its_going_to_get_bad_again/,3,"i’ve struggled with a concoction of eating disorders from age 12-present. i’ve been diagnosed with anorexia, bulimia and ednos because i literally take any and every route possible, depending on the day. 
i’ve always been a bit bigger because of my body shape and bone structure- i also have a hormonal condition that causes weight to stick pretty hard. unfortunately i’m one of those cases where unless you physically see my relationship with food you wouldn’t know i have an eating disorder. even my mom still doesn’t believe i do, even though i restrict heavily, starve myself, purge, abuse laxatives/hydroxycut, and over exercise. i’ve been to treatment, fainted in the gym more times than i can count. it’s had a hold on me since was so young. 
the thing is once i got to age 20 i was able to get a hold on my eating disorder because it was destroying my life, and through therapy and a nutritionist was able to start eating in a way that works for me. the thing is though, i gained about 30 pounds and now weigh 160… so last year my mom suggested i get a gastric bypass (she’s very fatphobic, and was 110 lbs most of her life and won’t accept that i’ve destroyed my body with eating disorders). my ED brain took it seriously so i made a consultation to get a gastric bypass where they laughed at me and immediately told me that I don’t qualify in the slightest and that if I want to lose weight I can exercise and eat right. it really broke my heart because my mom somehow had me totally convinced i actually needed the procedure. my body dysmorphia makes it to where i can’t gauge my appearance so i thought i may be valid. that was triggering- i relapsed, went back to therapy, back to square 1. was able to manage my weight for about a year, until recently when my sister told me my mother was constantly talking about how i’m going to die young because i’m morbidly obese, so i relapsed again 3 weeks ago. as of right now it’s only been purging and some restricting; but i just ordered a 6 month supply of hydroxycut as well as those garbage diet teas, and i plan on stocking back up on laxatives and over exercising again… i’d rather be seen as a valid human being even if it means i get really sick again…. i need help. i don’t know where to turn. i can’t turn to my parents because they never saw my eating disorder as valid because i never got lighter than 120 lbs. my mom supposedly tells my family i faked it all, despite having gone to treatment twice and having official diagnoses. 
i don’t know if i’m just ranting or what i think i’m going to gain. i think i just need to discuss this with people who understand. i just want to recover but i’m scared i never will

My mental condition went to shit I was depressed, anxious and used to get panic attacks. I had severe mood swings (used to end up fighting with someone in my family) , I even tried to end my life twice but at the last moment I was too chicken to do it and stress eating also got more intense. Its been 2 years I am not depressed or suicidal, I don't get panic attacks now, rest everything is the same except stress eating. I am not sure if its called stress eating or something else. I'll explain you everything in detail, I come from a vegetarian family in india but I like to eat meat. No one in my family eat meat so I have to eat it from outside, everyone here knows that indian street food is not at all healthy *please don't take it as an offense indians* . I end up eating a lot of street food, there was a time when days used to pass by without me eating home-cooked healthy food. There were days when I used to eat street food* as breakfast, lunch and dinner. Whenever I eat anything unhealthy or meat after I am done eating I am stuck by this huge wave of guilt, then I promise myself I won't do it again and I end up relapsing the next day. Gradually my health started taking toll .I developed h pylori bacteria and was diagnosed with dyspepsia as well as haemorrhoids. I have tried to improve my eating habits and have come to a point where I eat street food once every 2-3 days. I am on medical but still can't stop myself from eating shit. My health is degrading, I don't do any excercise and because of all this everything else in my life is getting affected . I have tried a lot to eat healthy whenever I try to put a vegetable or a fruit other than apple and watermelon I end up almost vomiting but I can drink fruit and vegetable smoothies but then they are not fulfilling and I get hungry after an hour or so. I don't hate my body, I am a little bit overweight its just that I hate what I have done to my body at such a young age. Please help!
*Street food in india is foods with lots of different spices and sauces cooked mostly in refined oil with worst quality cheap ingredients.

hi, i’ve been struggling with ed behaviours (not been diagnosed with an ed as have never spoken about it to a doctor) for quite a while now - it’s been on off since i was 13 but it’s gotten to the worse it’s ever been recently. my friend has not too long ago came out and said that she also believes she may have an ed - hers being based around purging while mine being more restrictive.
when she first came out to me saying she was struggling, i wasn’t that bad and felt that it was okay that she shared things with me that are potentially triggering like weight, calories, etc. but recently i have been getting really bad in terms of restricting and have now picked up purging behaviours which she has previously told me about. and because i have previously said that it was okay to speak about triggering things, she no longer checks with me to make sure that im okay with hearing it so just blurts out things that now trigger me. i don’t know how to tell her to stop as i don’t want her to feel like she has made me worse and she has previously said that she had a sense of relief having someone to talk to about it as she feels i am the only person she can be open with who will understand her. i don’t want her to go through this hard time she’s having alone but at the same time being there for her is making me worse.

I’ve noticed recently that they visit the bathroom frequently and on one occasion I heard them throwing up. They’ve mentioned that they don’t eat a lot and I’m worried about them. How can I support them without triggering them? What are some things I can do to check on them without seeming invasive? What kinds of things can I say to make them feel better? What things should I avoid saying around them? 

I really care about them and I know this sort of thing is hard to stop. I don’t expect to be able to do a whole lot for them, but I’d like to be able to do whatever I can. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",1631817533.0

Like today, I had a low-cal wrap and a salad but when I got home I realized how little I ate and how that was not recovery and so I ate a whole box of pocky’s and some toast to ‘up my calories’ and here is where the cycle starts. I start feeling extremely guilty for it and that will lead into tomorrow where, you guessed it, I’ll eat not enough and then pack in food at night.

i have a 30 yo uncle who has been through some rough time recently. he used to be very ""healthy"" and to ""look good"". he gained some weight and kind of stayed that way for a few months (i would say around 15/20 pounds)

he recently decided that he wanted to lose weight, which is ok.
but i started noticing he wasn’t eating that much and i asked him about his new diet.

turns out he eats 1100 kcal a day.
he is a 5’11 30yo man.

i tried talking to him so many times, explaining the medical reasons and why this is so unhealthy. he agrees with my statement but doesn’t want to change a thing.

i tried sending him some stuff from the internet explaining how this is wrong and what he should do if he wants to lose weight in a healthy way

nothing works. i’m a 16yo girl and i feel so sad watching this happening. i told the rest of the family about this, they don’t seem to be concerned. 

what should i do? i feel like i’m watching him dying in front of me?

what can i tell him?

About 3-4 years have passed and since then we ve been texting each other everyday . However for the past year I ve noticed a change with them, now they sometimes joke about not eating or being obsessed with their weight, but I didn't really know if they were joking because they always joke about messed up things, and I also didn't want to address it because i though it would make them uncomfortable. 

Today they told me their weight and made a joke about how fat they felt. But the thing is that their weight is lesser than the recommended for people of their height
So I couldn't ignore it anymore, I told them that I was very worried about them and that if they wanted to talk about how they felt I would always listen. They acknowledge that they have an unhealthy relationship with food but then they changed suddenly the subject and never talked about that anymore. 

I don't know how to help them, I really want to but at the end of the day we just text each other, I can't talk with their parents or help them irl.  I also wouldn't want to out them with their parents bc their unhealthy relationship with them and I would break their trust.

I've always had a very on/off relationship with food. Both in the amount I eat and what I eat. Theres times I hyperfixate on a specific food and eat only that for a few weeks, and then suddenly I can't eat it anymore.
I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, ocd, bipolar, adhd, and autism. 
I know no one on here can diagnose me, but even a pointer in the right direction or what this sounds like to them, please let me know",1630284062.0
Dating somebody with an ED / Support Advice?,3,pdkn7b,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/pdkn7b/dating_somebody_with_an_ed_support_advice/,0,"Hi everyone. I’m currently just looking for some advice to support a guy i'm currently dating who has an eating disorder.

I've recently been dating a guy and feel that we've found a great connection and honestly just looking for some advice on how to deal with the different traits that come with spending time with somebody who has an ED. (makes jokes about his bulimia to me, self deprecating, insecure, needy, feels disgusting, needs reassurance, mental health/negative intrusive thoughts, damaged by past relationship etc) - i really don't mind the neediness or anything, but i'm unsure and confused whether i'm helping or hindering this guy by pursuing a relationship when he may be in a difficult headspace to handle a relationship.

Since we started dating we're inseparable and super close. he has openly explained he wants to be 100% honest with me that he has mental health issues/negative intrusive thoughts and an eating disorder(bulimia) .

Recently we were planning for me to stay over at his apartment, but he expressed he was super nervous for me to stay over with him for a few days because he feels insecure and gross knowing i'm there while he's binging and purging.

He was in a really bad headspace since his last relationship ended as the ex was mentally damaging for him, calling him worthless and all kinds of mind games - his ex cheated on him numerous times and made him feel like he wasn't deserving of love or that was just how relationships were. being treated awfully was normal for him.

 I am genuinely into this guy and honestly feel like we are soulmates. The affection we both give each other and the interests we share etc. I don't want to come across like a life saviour because everybody has to be somewhat independent and comfortable enough to not rely on their partner to get them through life. that being said, I am still going to be supportive to somebody i'm close with.

He told me he has medication for his mental health, & purging all of the food he binges comforts him because it makes him feel ""less fat"" and ""its a way of purging the negativity out of him"" which made me super sad. although since we started talking/dating, he has let me know that i have personally made him so hopeful of the future and helped massively, and i've made such a positive change in him. i told him people are all going through their own personal issues and it's okay and 100% valid to feel these things. it sucks but time and surrounding yourself with positivity will help you heal more and more each day.

i expressed that i like him no matter what and i’m 100% there for him if he needs any support and in no way am i judgmental because i know everyone has their own struggles and issues in life. I let him know all of his qualities are attractive and perfect for me. i told him i am in no way a therapist or consultant for these types of things but i am sensitive to the subject and appreciate it’s a difficult thing alongside some mental issues

i do 100% believe we would be great together and told him sensitively that none of his personal issues define him.

I'm just concerned because i’ve really not experienced supporting or handling being around somebody with an eating disorder. he makes jokes about being bulimic and i awkwardly change the subject and try not to let it be the topic of conversation.

he’s scared of change (new city, new job, dating etc) and always is running away back to his family home because he committed everything to his last relationship which ended in signing a 12 month apartment contract for this guy he thought he would be with forever - that’s why he runs away back home, because he hates living there alone especially with his negative thoughts and place he associates with his toxic ex.

he drinks a lot of sugar free fizzy drinks after food/binging so that he can purge easier and tries to normalise the behaviour by saying he’s had himself checked out with a camera in his system and he’s all good, so sees no reason why he shouldn't continue purging. i’ve been left an hour or two at a time each night on the sofa while he purges and i feel awkward sitting around while i can hear him doing all of this in the bathroom.

i would eventually like to talk to him about getting professional help but don’t want to pressure him because i know the topic of conversation is a touchy one. sorry about the huge paragraphs, hopefully somebody can give me some advice.",1630194630.0

I go through the day with eating maybe 800 calories and then nothing for the rest of the day. I’m not picky at all, don’t hate eating or food, but it’s just the lack of care or interest for me.

The thing is, I’ve had food problems for 6 years now. The difference between now and then is that I was 120 pounds when I was really struggling. They thought I was just looking for attention, that I didn’t have a problem. That I wanted to go to therapy because it was what all my friends were doing. They thought that this was something I would just get over. I was not noticeably skinny so they thought I was fine. 

I’ve teetered around 110-125 in the past few years. 132 being my highest. I’m 5’2. The problems started when I was 15. I’m 21 now. 

Earlier this year I was switched to a new birth control pill. It made me go from 108 to 116 in a month. I was disgusted with myself. I tried to hard to lose the weight to no avail. I was also chewing and spitting at this time. I would lock myself in my room and chew and spit for hours. Spending $200 every few days on more food to spit. When I came home from college I weighed 115. I couldn’t believe I let myself get that high again. I tried exercise and reducing my calorie intake to lower my weight. I was still 116. I stopped weighing myself. I don’t weigh myself much anymore. In mid-June I was finally down to 112. 

I got curious the other day. I stepped on the scale, expecting to see 113. I’m 103. When did this happen? There no way for me to know. I didn’t even try. How did I lose 9 pounds in less than 2 months. My parents are onto me. However, now, I think I’m fine. Sure, I don’t eat as much as I used to, but I’m still eating. I don’t chew and spit as much. Now that I am noticeably skinny they care. My mom told me today that I have an eating disorder. Not like she even knows. Why is it that now she cares but when I was heavier and struggling it was for attention? My mom cried today because she thinks I’m going to die. They don’t want me to go back to college.

I’ve suffered with eating disorders on the past where I really wanted to lose weight and deprived myself of food or purged for those reasons. This was a long time ago.

I can’t chew food without gagging, I can drink smoothies and eat yogurt which has been keeping me going but I can’t eat anything solid. I keep thinking this will pass but it just really isn’t.

i’m not of legal age yet and i still live with my family - none of them know i’ve been restricting my eating or even tracking it, and that’s become a bit of an issue. i’m always incredibly stressed whenever i have to eat a meal that wasn’t cooked by myself, because i don’t know the exact calories, and that usually leads to binges. 

i was doing really good this week (ate around 1400 calories per day while staying active), but this afternoon i ate almost 500 calories worth of these chocolate wafer things, and afterwards i was just staring at my toilet and trying to force myself to throw up. i’ve never thrown up purposely before or been bulimic, but i thought i’d give it a try just this once, and it didn’t fucking work. i just can’t get myself to throw up. i’ve tried triggering my gag reflex with my finger and toothbrush and drinking salt water. nothing worked. 

i was so fucking upset that i just ate even more shit. my total calorie count today is 2000. i’m so fucking angry and stressed and i just want a goddamn ice cream cone but i know it’ll make me feel even worse.

I am 160cm and 40kg circa, but my shoulders are pretty wide, I know - rationally - I am slim but looking in the mirror I see a really muscular man.
my boyfriend is a little bit taller than 170cm but he has no muscles at all so he looks skinny and fragile, he doesn't have an eating disorder and he works out to be more big since he wants some muscles (and I am proud of him because it is his own decision and he is very determined for his goal) but still he is skinnier than me.
I know I am slim and skinny but I see other things when I look in the mirror, I don't know how I am.
it makes me feel even worse that he is the top in the relationship but he looks more fragile than me.
people have the tendency to protect him, but to me they say I have to be strong.
I think my ED is caused by the fact that since I was a child people tell me to be strong and I was taking care of my sister and cousins, the little amount of adults that were present in my life always give me the fault and I was even hit often for them. I can't cry, I can't show emotions, I have to be strong and independent.
I started to make the father figure for my sister at 8 and start to cook for her and all these things at pretty the same age, me her and my cousin lived basically alone. I needed to be strong.
but still, I feel awful when my bf triggers my ed. he is so sweet to me and always try to make me feel safe amd protected like the child I cannot have been years ago but see his slim legs or arm that seems like I can break them in half or his little amount of strength and power makes me feel bad and sad because I want to me like this.

I (20F) has always been obsessed with food my whole life as well as diets, Exercise and my weight. I just don’t think this amount of obsession with food is normal. I’ve had dramatic weight gains and loss because of it and it’s effecting my life. I see other girls going about saying that they forget to eat all the time or they just go by their day eating a small snack and not caring about eating food as much. 
And then there’s me, I always think about what I’m going to eat or what food I want to eat everyday (part of the reason why I’m actually obsessed with cooking.)
I snack whenever I’m not hungry all the time and even when I’m full I always feel like I need to finish my meal.  
Food gives me satisfaction, it makes me feel a certain way of comfort emotionally. It gives me pleasure when I don’t get any from my daily life and it’s such a big part of my life that I feel like because it is, it’s a problem. 

I don’t want to think about food this much, I struggle with my weight for so long and been on multiple diets to control it. Currently I’m trying to fast which controls how much I eat and it helps a lot, but I’m not really loosing weight from it because I’m still eating high caloric foods. 

I just wish I was able to control my thoughts and feelings about food, I just don’t feel normal because of it and I’ve struggled so much with my self esteem and the way that my body looks because of it. Would this relate to anyone else or am I just abnormal?",1629813835.0

Both times he cheated on me with people who are way thinner than I am. I'd look like a cow next to them. After the first time I purposefully starved myself to lose weight, so I could look more like them

I lost about 26Ibs/12 kgs this way. Eventually I got back together with him, but have been watching what I eat the entire time, but managed to gain about 13Ibs/6kgs, due to the unsustainable nature of how I lost it in the first place

The problem comes in now that I have exams and have to take anxiety tablets. The main reason my anxiety is sky high right now, is because of him cheating on me and continously lying to me. It is my biggest fear that he'd do that, and he did. Im facing my biggest fear each and every day now

Barely eating,3,p8jhmh,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/p8jhmh/barely_eating/,1,"I’d like to start off by saying that I’m not even sure If I’m posting this is the right place but ultimately I’m just looking for answers or ideas to why I barely eat. 

I feel like this all started about 4 years ago when I had gotten food poisoning. It left me sick and bedridden for about a month. That entire month I was eating nothing almost everyday. Maybe saltines here n there but I was mostly sleep for that entire month. I remember when I finally felt better and got to eat an actual meal it was hard. My teeth hadn’t been used or exercised in about a month so using them to chew things might’ve been the most painful feeling ever. I felt as though my teeth were getting ripped out of my gums, root and all. A very intense sore feeling. 

I found it hard to finish the plates my mom would make for me but my mom just told me that my stomach had probably shrunken and I just need to keep eating snd it’ll grow and I’ll be back to normal or whatever. 

I don’t know when it began after getting food poisoning but I kind of stopped eating all together, but not on purpose. I just won’t have an appetite for that day or I’ll literally be too lazy to make something or pick something up. Shit, I was too lazy to even order food on the phone I always had in my hand. It was just easier to not eat. Other days I would totally be hungry and hop in the kitchen and start to get down. But as soon as I sit down with that plate of food I just made, all my appetite would disappear and I would give it away or throw it away. Other days I’ll be in the middle of eating something and a wave of a feeling I can’t quite describe would stop me in my tracks and I’ll just be like “ehhh idk why but I don’t wanna eat anymore” it’s not like I’m disgusted by it or tired of what I’m eating I just don’t want to be eating anymore. 

For me this is really messing with my mental and my physical being. I hate knowing how hungry I am and wanting to eat but never eating, even when the food will be right in front of me. I just can’t ever hold an appetite for longer than 5 minutes. So if I don’t eat when I’m completely hungry and have the appetite for it, I won’t eat for a couple of days. 

I got a boyfriend 3 years ago (still dating) and I thought one of the perks of having a boyfriend was the healthy relationship weight you pack on (which was perfect bc I was trying to gain weight already) but if anything I’m losing weight. I avoid telling my boyfriend when I don’t eat, especially when it turns into days, bc he always just yells at me about how much I need to eat and how he doesn’t wanna have to worry about it bc he’s got a lot of other things to worry about.

So I am 21/F, at age 13 I had bulimia and from there it went on for about a 1 and 1/2. At the time I was suffering with severe depression without knowing and I had never seeked any medical help up until I was 20. 

I thought in the past I was strong enough to overcome anything and back then people used to look at depression as something you could just get over and so I had the same mentality with my ED, I did well to stop myself from continuing to live that life but it caught up with me in ways I hadn't expected. 

Getting and drunk or being hungover and being sick, felt good but I knew it was bad to like it and it didn't kick in for a long while that I was enjoying it because it was the feeling of what it was like when I was bulimic. 

I decided 5 years ago that in diet change I wanted to go vegan, it was for the right reasons and I wasn't expecting it but I lost weight like it was nothing. I had bones showing out of skin and I hadn't ever seen them before and I was ecstatic about it. In 3 months I had lost 4 stone. Time went on however and now more and more vegan things are coming out which has meant more and more that things that where vegan have eventually become unhealthy again.

I went on birth control, I was eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted and It caught up with me and I was piling on the pounds. Safe to say I am still in that rut where I am at a weight I no longer desire again. I'll be honest and say I am still binging. It gets worse and worse to the point Im not sure if I'm even vegan anymore. 

My mum makes all my meals and I'll sit there and wait till she goes on her late shift to then order myself some food, sometimes I get things with cheese on it. I cant tell you how many bags I have hiding in my room where it is all takeaways I'm trying to hide from my mum as I know she checks the bins to make sure I eat. 

My mum not that long ago found out that I had a past ED, she doesn't know I'm currently in a different one. I don't think she fully understands it and I don't think she understands the toll it has on someone especially with depression playing into it. My brain doesn't work in ways that she can understand.

Thats why the other day, to me it was a big deal but to her it was nothing. My mum put me on a diet. I was there on sunday laying in bed wondering why I was still so hungry, naturally I waited for her to go on shift and ordered myself so much food and binged. 

I then had a shift at work and my mum told me she had made my food for the day, ""this is your 500 day"" she said. We had previously discussed about doing the 5:2 diet which essentially is on 2 days of the week you eat only 500 calories in the day, the rest of the week you can eat whatever you want. However, even though I said I'd be down to try it again (failed in the past) I didn't know it was going to be right away. 

So when I was told that the day was my 500 day, i sarcastically (but also meant it) replied that it was nice of her to let me know I was starting my diet that day. Little did I know she then went on to tell me it wasn't my first day as she had put me on it on the sunday... hence why I was hungry and ordered food. 

It was weird because anyone else I've spoken to about think my mum was just trying to be kind. But i know in my head that they also just don't get it. My head was in loops when I found out. I already didn't like myself from binging on the sunday and then to find out that should have been my 500 day made me more disgusted with myself because although it shouldn't be what I think, the first thought that came to my head was that I should have been starving myself that day. 

Not sure this is the best diet for me to be going on right now. Don't know if anyone else has had something like this happened to them but let me know how everything got on. I'm not doing well in general and I really want to stop binging but the moment I do I feel like I'm starving myself and I get aggy.",1629326809.0

Positive notion,6,p17pxg,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/p17pxg/positive_notion/,0,"Hey guys. I’ve been struggling with ED for my entire life(no joking, I remember hating myself at 6!) . It got especially bad this winter when I found out about IF and got crazy starving myself to the point I couldn’t stand up without holding on to something. After 5 months of this I started to lose my hair viciously and was overall extremely tired of restricting and not letting myself to focus on other things so I decided to recover.

It wasn’t so easy to stop controlling and I would never stop counting calories, but at least the “clock” in my head had stopped (negative sides of IF). A month ago I just had enough of calculating calories every single day so I turned off the calculator as well.

I just eat whatever feels good every day, there are no restrictions except for eating what I want(so I don’t eat cucumbers anymore to fill my stomach). Believe me, this is the life everyone should have (I still can’t get rid of the thoughts about food though).

Today I was curious how many calories I eat intuitively so I tried to count it (I wasn’t counting it throughout the day, but summarized my meals at the end of the day). It’s such a wonder for me that I actually consume less calories that I used to when I was obsessed with controlling my diet. Now I don’t count any calorie that comes in my mouth, I just enjoy it.

I just want to cheer you up a bit and show that every single fear about food is in your head. You deserve a better life! People are not often worth trusting, but your body surely is! Just let it show you what it’s like to just live.

So I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, bulimia and ED my whole life. Some parts of me hate to be like this. Some parts of me kind of are too attached to it to let it go. Anyways. Recently I got helped with a holistic dietitian, we had a few appointments, she seemed extremely nice and good vibes, and I felt that she really got me. She told me that I could count on her and that she would be there with me on my weight loss journey. 

So after a few appointments there was one day I felt really sick and had a few episodes 🤢 on the day of our appointment. So I wrote her a message asking if instead of a regular face to face appointment, if she could use that booked time to read an email that I wrote opening up to her about my ED and telling my most deep secrets that not even my partner knows about, such as bulimia habits, how I hate myself, how depressed I am... 

I told her because I really needed help. I told her because I really did not wanted to give up on my self, I wrote to her that it was my last call for help. 

I felt comfortable (or naive) enough to after 4 appointments believe that we had a true connection. That she was kind to me because she really wanted to help me no matter what. 

Two days after this email she replied that she received my email and she was going to reply it soon. 

This was two weeks ago and Friday I decided to give another try, so I sent her a voice message asking her if she saw my email, that I understand that it was quite important to me, and if she do not would like to continue as my dietitian to let me know. I sent this last one crying. Apologising for being too much but thing were really hard for me. Still no reply. 

Even though I told her how bad I was, I desperate for help I was. 
I was calling for help. 
I thought I could ask for help. But no. 

The worst part is that I can’t stop to overthink it, check my phone to see if she replied, check my email, check her social media, I’m becoming a stalker or something, the fact that she rejected help really messed with my mind, I think I’m getting crazy sometimes. 

The truth is. Nobody gets it. People are as disgusted by it as us. Nobody is there to save us. I will never trust no one anymore. 😓",1628431887.0

So I simply stopped eating diner throughout it the day and I would wait until I would get home (at 5:30) to eat anything. 

Do I have a fear of food? Or am I just mixing not eating with anxiety? 

Today, I didn’t eat anything because I knew I would go to a party and I didn’t want anxiety. Now, when I got home I’m drunk and I don’t have the energy to even eat. 

I think my brain gives my stomach signals to feel sick when I eat anything out of my home since as soon as I take a bite of food I instantly feel sick and need to go to the washroom. I’m tired of fearing my own stomach and I envy my friends who can literally eat whenever and whatever they want. 

One thing that I need to mention: I do love seeing those number on the scale go down when I barely eat on days I feel like my mind took over my stomach. 
So far I was at 154 pounds (on days when I ate food) and now I’m at 145 pounds (I weighed myself this morning). It’s been three weeks with only eating when I get home and eating until I explode and then one week with only eating one meal when I get home.",1628322316.0

I’m 5’4 and weigh 99 lbs, so my BMI is 17. 
According to my doctor, I’m underweight. But BMI doesn’t count for weight in the abdomen or in the face,now does it?...
Those are the two main areas I fixate on and shame myself for. 
I’m insecure about my body (leading me to eschew social situations) and am very restrictive with my diet. 
But when I revealed my weight to my parents they’re in shock and disbelief.
Meaning, as I’ve mentioned, it’s hard to believe I’m underweight when you look at me. 
I’m in a state of confusion abt how to act cause on one hand I look in the mirror and see nothing but fat, on the other my loved ones are starting to see my restrictive tendencies and are heavily concerned. They’ve told me in panicky voices that they should’ve “saw the signs earlier” and that I look like a Holocaust survivor but I think they’re over exaggerating.
Anyway, I eat small portions and exercise as much as possible. And I’ll continue to do so until I achieve a body I’m happy with. Even if I don’t want to...
I’ve come so accustomed to this ‘striving for unreachable perfection’ lifestyle that I won’t be able to get out of it any time soon. And it doesn’t help that my mom said I just naturally have a “big face on a skinny body”. 
Yeah, that makes me want to eat even less. She comments on the size of my thighs as well, saying that I’ve room to tone up. But to be fair, I chose to confide in her asking for an honest opinion on my features...So idk what to believe at this point.

My everyday meal consists of a plate of literal plain chicken or meat. I’ve experienced other foods as well but it’s only a handful. I’ve yet to try 99.9% of foods including fruits, vegetables, sauces, condiments..youu name it, if it’s not plain chicken or meat then it’s very likely I haven’t tried it. Here is where my concern comes in because up until now i’ve never been bothered by my meals... but recently even chicken and meat seems to disgust me. I would love to eat new foods but there is some kind of disorder which will not allow me to even simply taste something new. Last time I tasted something new was involuntary when i was around 13 years old my brother tried shoving some cheese in my mouth which immediately triggered my gag reflexes and made me vomit. Sometimes I eat and find myself chewing to the point I just don’t feel like eating, I feel a sense of disgust & force myself to swallow my food with some water.

i’ve been starving myself the past week in the name of “health” bc some of my issues may be solved if i’m thinner. i’m lying to my loved ones about eating but even they aren’t worried bc i’m still technically overweight. sometimes it’s like they r proud of me and my discipline and it makes me so fucking sad. i hate food now and i hate eating and i am going down the same road i did before. i’m happy bc i’m losing weight but sad bc i can’t even fight the negativity since i’m in physical pain. idk, i just needed somewhere to talk about it :/ idk what to do",1628081361.0

***As a token of appreciation for your time and for sharing your experience, participants who enter their details at the end of the survey will go into a raffle to win 1 of 10 Amazon e-Gift cards valued at AUD$100.***

This research project aims to develop a motives for binge eating scale. This study is also exploring factors that may increase the risk of binge eating. Specifically, this study examines the relationships between negative childhood experiences (e.g., emotional abuse or invalidation), shame, self-compassion, and motives for binge eating. It is hoped that the results of this research will inform preventative and treatment strategies for individuals experiencing binge eating. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participation in this survey is voluntary, no identifiable information will be collected, and all responses will remain anonymous, except for those participants who choose to provide their contact details at the end of the survey for the purpose of follow-up interviews, in which case information will remain private and only accessible to the student investigator, co-investigator, and principal investigator.

It would also be greatly appreciated if you could forward this advertisement or survey link to any friends, colleagues, or family members who are currently experiencing difficulties with binge eating, as I am hoping to reach as many people as possible.

To lose weight I tried everything, OMAD, water fasting, keto and it only makes it worse!

I feel now a bit depressed and want to recover. I am trying to eat normally (no more restrictive eating for my metabolism to get normal again) but I am bloating so much and my stomach hurts. With my stomach bloating, I feel even worse. I don’t want to go out or to meet friends again because I don’t feel confident. I have a hard time to concentrate at work as well. Now I cry so easily as well. I decided to take a personal trainer twice per week to lose weight in a healthy way and help with my stress. 

How long does the bloating last ? What should I do recover and los weight at the same time ? I feel so lost.

I'm trying to incorporate more into my diet (old safe foods) and, above all else, believe that I am not some hideous waste of space. Yet I'm constantly anxious and have no appetite at all, and seem to feel guilty eating anything half the time. 

I was under CAHMS for EDNOS (kind of orthorexia?) about two years ago... unfortunately they didn't really help and I'd heard worse of adult services so decided to swerve them, giving my therapist the impression I'd carry on 'doing well'. This wasn't the case. Other factors: Covid, university, etc. have made maintaining a reasonable virtually impossible and from early 2021 I entered into a downward spiral of weight loss and misery. It's a bit grotty.

I feel stupid - I have enough wrong with me without an ED - and unable to move. I just don't know what to do with myself. I have a psychotherapist... but he doesn't really seem to understand how bad this all is and I just can't tell him because he seems to be the only friend I've got. My Mum, my biggest support, is trying to help me too... though I can't overrely on her. She was my biggest support and biggest help last time but everything just feels so impossible now. I look hideous, need to gain weight - yet feel disgusting and need some form of motivation to do so because I lack it in every capacity. I used to love cooking, baking and feeling well on a semi-vegan (occasional egg) diet - but now I find that I'm not all in it at all. I'm seemingly just getting worse: my face has swollen (no idea why) - eyes and relatively evenly below the corners of my mouth; I'm constantly needing to pee; mottled legs and always cold (rollnecks in summer, you name it). It's very bad and I hate to worry everyone so much - as much as I try to hide all this.

Whenever talking with her she'll most likely bring up how she hasn't eaten or does want to eat but doesn't and has lost 'x' amount of weight this week etc, in an almost bragging and positive manner?

This is more of a cry for help to anyone who understands the mental health system (particularly the Australian one)- Can the treatment team legally ban my parents from visiting me, and can they take my phone away from me without parental consent (the taking away the phone is to prevent me from contacting my mum).

Throughout treatment, my mum has been my biggest support and is pretty much the only reason I have been able to accept any treatment. However, she has pointed out many flaws in the way the hospital treats eating disorders and the doctors do not like their authority being challenged. 

As a result, they have basically implied that she is preventing me from receiving treatment and I'm no longer allowed to see her. Today they forcibly removed my phone away from me.

I can't be discharged by her via 'against medical consent' as I'm pretty sure that would get me put under the Mental Health Act which would strip away more of my rights.",1627371602.0

I was 14 when I felt I was finally approaching my ideal BMI when my mom got worried and asked me to stop losing weight. I did so, even when I was two last kilos from my goal and started to feeling great in my body. But I was looking very unhealthy, eating normal but exercising 2-3 hours each day. 

As far as I remember I was on and off some special true healthy eating. I think I tried everything. I was vegan for cca five years and increasingly taking new foods from my diet. And then having cravings for everything. Binge eating chocolate, sausage, joggurt ... you name it.

Now I'm trying to eat everything, trying to test the taste of dishes I remember and wondering it it's the same as I remember. 

Last two weeks I'm on camp and I don't cook for myself. Today is one of the bad days when I don't like to eat things that are planned today. Everyone is eating lunch and I'm hiding on the bed. I don't want to eat that food and I'm also sick of asking for something I would eat.

I plan on going to a doctor relatively soon, but I'm wondering if there's some better wording I can use when trying to explain my situation. I completely understand that nobody on this subreddit can give me completely safe/true medical advice, I'm just seeking a word or type of (even unrecognized) ED so I can point myself in the right direction when talking to a medical professional.  


I'm 23, male, 5'8"" and currently I weigh \~115lbs? I'm definitely underweight, but until this year I was closer to 100lbs, so we've got some little victories!!  
Lately, I've found myself really struggling with eating certain things. I find that if I cook something for myself, no matter how good or bad it is, I can't finish eating it. I'll have premade snacks here and there, but I get most of my food from eating take out, or if somebody else cooks for me. When one of those two situation arise, I can put back at least 2 people's worth of food, but if it's something I've made for myself, I can eat maybe 4 spoonfuls and then I feel completely full. I find myself going days on end not eating enough to the point where I don't even feel hungry anymore. Financially I can't keep up with this. I easily spend upwards of $600/month on fast food, and that's still having me go hungry most days.  
I also struggle with low blood sugar, and keeping up with keeping hydrated.

This is definitely something I want to get looked at by a professional but I'm nervous as to what they might tell me, or that I won't say the right words to get my point across.",1627190652.0

When I really think about it, I don’t know what is okay and not okay when it comes to eating. I don’t know what “healthy etiquette” is. I just see food as something that can fill my stomach and end my boredom. I don’t see something unhealthy, I don’t see something healthy, I don’t see the right or wrong type of meal.

I’ll still have dinner with my wife, but what she doesn’t know is the McDonald’s I had on my way home from work, or the 3 s’mores I had when she was at her parents house. I’ll hide the evidence and convince myself it didn’t happen.

I used to be 8kg lighter. I recovered physically but the hilarious part is that I  barely changed my diet and exercise routine. I've always eaten a wholesome pescatrian diet that consist of breakfast, lunch and dinner with a small 'desert' after lunch and dinner. My portions are generous for every meal. I love sports, I'm athletic and exercise 4 times/week. From the outside, I look like someone who's got their life together; my own company, a stable relationship, a loving family and a good group of friends. However, I miss my old body so much that it makes me severely depressed and nothing in life makes me happy. I used to be the thinnest out of everyone I knew. Now, I have friends who lost weight and are thinner than me. I constantly look at my old pictures, compare myself to every single person around me and on Instagram. I don't understand how people can skip meals, fast, eat small portions, serve themselves only once, forget to eat, exercise every day etc. If I did that, the empty pit in my stomach would distract me and all I would do is think about my next meal. I would suffer. I can lose 2-3 hours a day taking pictures and videos and analysing every square inch of my body. My mind is poisoned. However, with an eating disorder plaguing my every thought, I still perform really well. But imagine my mind free of it. My potential is huge. But in all honesty, my body makes me so angry and depressed that nothing matters and all I want is to lose a bit of weight. Never go down to the level I was because I would destroy my company, my relationship and everything around me, but maybe 3-4kg. However, no matter how much I try, I cannot seem to change the way I eat or exercise. I can't stop eating that small desert after lunch or my 5 squares of dark choc after dinner. I can't just cut a little bit out of my meal, just a little. I can't do any of that. I can't up my exercise to 5 times instead of 4.

Ever since though, food guilt has been awful. Before this I was super restrictive in my diet to maintain cutting and losing fat, and since then I’ve tried to be more healthy about it since I felt it wasn’t good for me to be worried so much at my age / weight. 

My issue is that I simply can’t stop my habits: counting calories, not wanting to go out when my friends get food, checking myself in the mirror etc. 
Everyone tells me that at my age I shouldn’t be so concerned, but I am constantly anxious about it. Even now, I’m on vacation with my family, and we keep on going out to dinner and getting treats, and all I can do is read nutritional facts on the internet and estimate my calories.

i blame my mother for most of my problems,14,offlme,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/offlme/i_blame_my_mother_for_most_of_my_problems/,0,"so i’ve been putting a lot of thought into this and i think the main reason i have an eating disorder is my mother.

for one, i’ve always been a picky eater and the entire time i was growing up she hated that. she would force me to eat foods i hated and i have vivid memories of her forcing me to eat mashed potatoes even tho the consistency and texture made me gag every time and she knew that. i would be sitting at the table crying about to throw up just so that she could make sure i ate my vegetables instead of her giving me literally anything else that wasn’t torture for me to eat. 

she would always say that it was my fault there wasn’t any food i liked around the house and that if i asked for stuff she would get it but whenever i asked for anything i was ignored. one time i asked for sliced apples and my father said it wasn’t a valid request so i didn’t get any. i have braces and can’t bite into apples but i don’t always have it in me to cut an apple up so i literally just wanted apple slices but i didn’t get those.

eventually my mom got tired of forcing me to eat food that i didn’t like so she just stopped giving me food at all. she continued making food for my brothers and just told me i was old enough to handle it myself. so then i was left having a horrible relationship with food because of my mother, and no one to make sure i was eating. 

eventually i found foods i liked and it turned into even more of a problem because then instead of just not eating much it turned into a cycle of me eating way too much that i felt sick and then me starving myself because of how terrible i felt. and throughout all of this my mother would make comments about my body.

i felt so insecure because of her that i would wear clothes that covered literally everything. when i finally got my eating under control and was comfortable with my body, i started dressing like normal teenagers do and that was clearly unacceptable because according to my mom wearing a tank top in 90 degree weather isn’t allowed.

i had also gone to my doctor at one point and she was concerned that i was underweight and told me to go see her again after three months so of course after we left the appointment my mom got mad at me for not eating. when we went back three months later the doctor was happy that i hadn’t lost anymore weight (because i put in the effort to try and get better) and my mom told her that i don’t actually have a problem i’m just a picky eater and find it fun to be difficult about meals.

so anyway i refuse to reread that so hopefully it makes sense but yeah i’m fairly certain if it weren’t for my mom i would be able to actually eat normally and typing all that made me feel a lot better. i always feel bad talking to my friends about this stuff because the people that don’t get it just make me feel so much worse but i don’t want to hurt the people that do get it by reminding them of how hard it can be.",1625650736.0

Should I Stay in My Sport?,4,oe930l,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oe930l/should_i_stay_in_my_sport/,3,"I’ll start with some context. I joined Color Guard my sophomore year (I will be a senior this fall) of high school and had a full, regular season until the end of Winter Guard when the pandemic began. We had a “season” in the fall of 2020 with no competitions and an exhibition performance, however I was diagnosed with Anorexia near the end of the season and had to quit as it was no longer safe for me to continue. After quitting and not having to do a season of Winter Guard, I felt a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. For one I was too weak to do very well at all, which made me embarrassed and quite stressed. I also realized how big of a commitment Color Guard was, not only time wise but emotionally, mentally and physically it consumed me. However, I also felt a sense of guilt not having finished out the season and returning for Winter Guard. I missed the activities my guard traditionally does together, the performing, competition days, and just the activity in general. So when this year rolled around and my recovery only got better and better, I told myself that this season would be my opportunity to push myself and have the best season yet with my newfound confidence and awareness of my health. I have improved a lot and am not as worried about performing poorly like I was my sophomore year. However, my school is a big school with a band that consistently competes at the state and national level. Because of this, we are highly competitive, and have intense and lengthy rehearsals. Lately I have felt myself slipping and I have restricted more than I thought I was. I exercise on a regular basis and I can feel myself losing my stamina, and I did weigh myself this morning and I have lost a substantial amount of weight in a short time. I know this isn’t sustainable for Color Guard, and if I continue down this road it will end my season like last year. Part of me is really afraid to do Guard because I worry it will send me backwards and I will have to quit again. I do have a rigorous schedule too, and additional stress at school is a trigger for me. I really do love Guard and letting go is really hard for me to think about, but a part of me doesn’t believe I can stop restricting and that Guard will make it even worse.",1625497069.0

Things have been getting worse over the past month and I don't know how to tell my therapist. I've never been formally diagnosed with an ED but things have escalated to the point that I think I may have a full blown eating disorder. My therapist knows I struggle with really low self-esteem, obsessively counting calories, and restricting what I eat, which has caused me to lose an unhealthy amount of weight. She has expressed to me that if things don't get better that she may break confidentiality and tell my parents (I'm 18 and will be moving away for college in August) because I guess obsessively restricting caloric intake falls into the category of self harm. What she doesn't know is that over this past month I've also been struggling with binging and purging which has been really taking a toll on me mentally. 

She always tells me I look healthy when I express how I never feel like I'm thin enough even though I've gone from a healthy weight to underweight over the past few months. It's really triggering for me because I convince myself she doesn't think I'm thin enough to deserve help. I feel like if I tell her I've been struggling with binging and purging and that I really need help because I've been in a bad place she  either won't take me seriously or she'll get my parents involved.

I'll spare the details, but it wasn't extremely bad, I was a good 30lbs underweight. College definitely helped me get some sense of normal for a bit where I wasn't too concerned like I used to be. 

However, now I'm kind of on the edge of tipping back. I'm going on a beach trip soon with my boyfriend and some friends and I'm feeling super insecure about it. I do like the added weight on me, (still technically under but not by much) but I'm starting to go back to the mindset that any fat on my body is bad. I have the tiniest abount on my stomach, but it's bothering me so much that I'm starting to exercise again like crazy and not eating as much to get rid of it. And then later I binge and feel terrible. 

I'm kind of stuck here. I know it's not a good thing, but I've become extremely insecure about what I'll look like to other people.",1625111815.0
Self-sabotage?,7,oavr1t,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oavr1t/selfsabotage/,1,"I have been struggling with my ED for a little over a year now. The thing that has caught me most off-guard and actually quite troubles me is how accepting I have become of my eating struggles and almost take a sort of comfort in the extreme restriction? My grades are falling miserably and I have exams coming up in a month's time, but it's like I have subconsciously decided to give up on recovering and caring. Does anybody have any tips to deal with this or perhaps share their experience if they've had a similar one. I just don't know why I am not as worried about my ED as I was a year ago.",1625054149.0

I feel like it’s getting really bad again and I don’t know what to do. I cried today even thinking about food I feel like throwing up and I started working out again till I can’t do anything anymore.

Family ig,7,oarkio,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oarkio/family_ig/,1,"It doesn’t happen often but every once in a while my mom or dad accidentally body shames me without knowing they hurt me. 
For example I got a new pair of shorts and my mom told me that she thinks I’m too big for the shorts, this has happened with other clothing items too. And my mom glorifies certain foods and demonizes certain foods, and constantly goes on diets which she also “fails” every time. And anytime I bake or cook food that could have any kind of sugar in it, my dad tells me to stop making that kind of food and that our family is fat enough, which counts me as I am in the family. All of this crap is taking a toll on me, even though I hasn’t happened recently I still remember all of it as clear as day and it feels horrible. Now I can’t eat unhealthy food without feeling horrible and I eat around 200-1000 calories a day scared of gaining weight and looking to lose weight. I’m scared to have too many carbs and sugar and part of this is because of the stuff my parents have said without knowing it would hurt me or my siblings in anyway.  And diet culture is just making all of it worse.",1625035541.0

Scared to shop for new clothes (Trigger Warning: Numbers),6,oackc4,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oackc4/scared_to_shop_for_new_clothes_trigger_warning/,1,"I've always had disordered eating. However, after a really bad stint with my ex  a few months ago my self-esteem got shot pretty heavily and it developed into a full-fledged eating disorder. I dropped 40 pounds in two months. I would go three days without any food at all and the thought of eating food scared me that I'd just put weight back on again. When I did eat, I'd manage about 500-600 calories a day. Just, it started getting really bad. 

Luckily I have so many people who are supportive and we managed to catch it really quick. I'm still working on it and still struggling. At one point I was eating two meals and a snack but that's slid back to one meal and possibly a snack. But due to all of this and the amount of weight I've lost, I need new clothes. I'm not underweight yet and trying not to get there, but my clothing is almost falling off me. 

I'm terrified to go and get new clothes, however. The fact my current ones are falling off shows me the weight I lost and makes me feel decent about everything for the most part. I have no idea what size I might be in now, and I'm worried that if I try on a pair of jeans to realise they are too small it might trigger a relapse. 

I'm trying really hard to get my eating back to a good place. Luckily my boyfriend has managed to convince me that he loves my body, so that helps. And he's helping me try to remember to eat. He's just amazingly supportive, but I'm still so scared to go and do this even though I know I'm going to have to. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to do this without completely freaking out?",1624986434.0
Please help!! Any advice helpful,3,oa1z4w,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oa1z4w/please_help_any_advice_helpful/,3,"Okay so the past week I have seen a dietician and she gave meal plan to follow. I am struggling so much but have been trying to increase from the low levels of calories I am already on. the past two days from very slowly increasing I have already gained 300 grams?? How the fuck is that possible. The first couple of days of increasing my intake each day my weight didn't change (actually went down once) but  i increased the next 2 days by like 50-70 calories per day over the past 2 days and now my weight has went up. I know my metabolism is screwed up and extremely slow but I thought I would have to eat like minimum 1000 calories to gain. I am freaking out and don't know how I can through with this if I gain when my dietician is well aware I'm at no state to even consider gaining and the goal was to stop the weight loss not gaining! Also those past two days where increased my food I had high sodium rich foods and bigger portions in one sitting so was very full and bloated so I'm wondering if that had something to do with it? I don't want to restrict but im in such a conflicting state and really would appreciate any advice or experience if anyone has any!

Since then my parents bully me because I am fat and I eat like shit and stuff like that. First of all I am 20 and this morning my dad called me and said to me that if I don’t go to a nutritionist and to the gym he will stop supporting my costs during university and he also said that I can’t dress the way I want anymore and other stuff. Anyways he just said that if I don’t lose weight I won’t be able to go to university. I mean does he realize how crazy he is and how immature this is?

Supporting my partner,6,o949j1,eating_disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/o949j1/supporting_my_partner/,3,"Hi everyone,

So recently I’ve found out that my partner is recovering from an eating disorder. Sometimes he eats but sometimes he struggles to. Recently though, he’s been really trying and I’m so so proud of him! 
I really want to help him as much as I can but fear that I’m not helping enough or that I’m not doing the right things as I have no experience. 

One thing he finds nice is when I ask if he’s eaten today; to which he usually replies “yes but only something small”. 
I feel incredibly proud of him and the progress he’s made and I’m wondering what are some supportive things I can say or do when they tell me they’ve eaten? 

I tell him “I’m so proud of you” and then tell him he’s doing amazingly but I don’t want to just keep saying the same things, yknow? 
Again, I’m overthinking. 

If anyone has any advice that would be great! Thank you :)
