0,fp,"Even during my diet days, I never deliberately ate such shitty food. 

He says that he ""has a background in nutrition,"" which could mean almost anything. 

And the plural of ""loaf"" is ""loaves.""

1,fn,"I now understand that you can‚Äôt maintain a caloric deficit but you can maintain your goal weight once you recalculate your TDEE at that weight and feel good/fueled. It has taken me almost 10 years of gaining/losing to figure this out!! I used to think I was doomed because I always thought you can‚Äôt maintain a deficit (true) but once you start eating normally then you‚Äôll just automatically gain it all back (which is also true if you don‚Äôt change habits while in the deficit). I used to think I was just dealt bad genetics, I was the fat kid all my life. But when I really think about it, I was not active as a kid and ate way too much. Ultimately it‚Äôs calories in/calories out, I do believe food quality matters too however I gained weight eating the most high  quality nutrient dense food because I was eating too many calories for my expenditure. Science lol. I feel dumb it took me this long to realize. Now I want to focus on building muscle and changing body composition while in a very minimum surplus like 100 calories over a day until I‚Äôm satisfied with the muscle I‚Äôve built and then go back to maintaining. And I realize how freaking EASY it is to overeat especially garbage food! And how you really cannot exercise it off, it would take hours everyday to do that. I get it now. Anyone else ever felt so happy once they figured this out? Sorry if this post is silly, just wanted to share."
2,fp,"This is the first job I‚Äôve had with a positive environment, a great boss, and great coworkers. I called in today because I was feeling so nauseous and rundown. Does anyone else feel really guilty when you take a day for yourself?"
3,fp,Amazing responses so far. Really thoughtful and open.
4,fn,"Hello! I've been losing weight for around a month now, and I'm down about 7 and half pounds. A few people recommended to me to focus less on the scale and more my measurements, how clothes fit, etc. But I feel like it's been the opposite for me because my scales are showing me steady progress but my measurements have barely budged!

I've lost a bit off my hips so I'm most perplexed about my waist measurement since it hasn't changed at all. And I don't mean it's every so slowly going down on the tape measure, I mean it's been somehow stuck solidly at 32' and it's admittedly super frustrating.

So when did you guys start noticing a change in measurements? Does it have anything to do with my bottom-heavy body type or have I just not lost enough weight yet?"
5,fp,"Have lost approx 40 lbs over the last 7 months through exercise, portion control and lazy IF. I found weighing myself daily throughout has been a huge motivator BUT now that the weight loss has slowed, do I stop weighing and go by measurements? I think I have about 10-15lbs before I am at my ""goal"" weight but want to tone up alot more. How do you stay motivated when you dont constantly see the number going down? Thanks to this community "
6,fn,Like there was this one Rhianna song that was huge with us there and now whenever it comes on I like get hit with this overwhelming wave of my loserness that I couldn't even pay people to care and failed at that too and ... I feel like maybe insurance cutting out and all the false starts Etc that happened after are all just more lowercase t trauma and I'm like stuck there in that time in that mental place ... like I have more experience and knowledge now but who I **am** got frozen then and I'm still there ... does that make any sense?! (And of course I'm still fat ...)
7,fp,"I don't know if this is appropriate but I'm not sure where else to vent. I have struggled with disordered eating since about 14, not diagnosed. I've never been that worried about it because it always felt like a switch. The self hatred was always there but I could turn off the bad eating habits so I always felt safe. But about a year ago with everything happening in the world I fell into a deep depression and oddly enough for the first time in my life started working on NOT hating myself in an effort to lessen the heaviness that had sunk in.

I've gotten to the point where I do now love my body, even if only for what it is and what it does and not always how it looks (because that is a constantly changing and worthless value point). I have compassion and no longer tie my self worth to weighing less. Yet I can't stop losing weight now, food has no joy or taste. Before it almost had a kind of forbidden tabbo that would honestly help me get back into sustainable caloric intake. But I've been allowing myself to eat anything I want, for the first time I placed no restrictions of safe and unsafe food, I mentally made everything just fuel. How could learning to love my body as it is end up making my eating habits worse!!! It's so unfair, I've spent the better part of a miserable year stopping self harming and stopping the negative thoughts. I've changed my whole mentality through months of constant work and I'm rewarded with the inability to enjoy food since I took away the negativity.

Now all I see is a shrinking small body, I refused to see the smaller body as good or bad but for the first time in my life I'm scared. I've tried multiple times to 'flip the switch' back to healthy eating and it just won't stick. I'm tired, tired of constantly having to eat and re wire my thoughts. I'm tired of thinking about my body, I've been thinking about it every day for over a decade. I thought once I embraced self love my problems would be solved but somehow I made it worse.

Now I don't know what to do, I refuse to go back to the self hatred of before unless it's a last resort, but how can THAT be the better answer. I want to start running and working out again but I can't risk losing more weight. I feel lied to, I'm finally doing everything right and NOW I can't stop losing weight! Back when I would have given the world to lose a few pounds I couldn't to save my life and now I can't manage maintaining. I just want a normal life where I don't think about my body every goddamned second. I got exactly what I wanted so bad when I was younger but i don't want any part of it now. I'm so tired."
8,fp,"Almost a year ago to the day I posted about being a heavier girl with an ED and went on about how much I hated myself while I also posted a picture.

I realize this can be extremely triggering to others and I was definitely seeking validation, so that I could stop the self loathing.

I apologize if I upset or triggered anyone by it, and I realize my need to seek validation can hurt others.

While I never got any backlash for it, the comments were archived and I hid the post.

Again, I'm sorry for seeming insensitive and I'm continuing to learn and grow <3"
9,fn,"I thought I was doing okay before the holidays of 2020. I could easily walk past a snack without shoving it in my mouth. Bam! The holidays show up and by the 3rd of November I'm accidentally on my 3rd Christmas pie. I'm on the 4th of January and it would seem I have put on 12 pounds. I am ever closer to the 80kg mark. 

I can no longer joke about being 'a bit of a foodie' as it has become apparent."
10,fn,"Hello,

Over the past about 5 years I've gained around about 30kg. I started gaining weight after I settled down with my husband, I noticed. However, my husband and I are currently long distance, and the last time I saw him he did comment on my weight. He wasn't horrible, just stated that he's noticed I've gained a bit and just to be careful for my health. I've never been a healthy weight, I've always been at least slightly overweight, so I didn't take offence to what he said because I am now obese, and I'm getting to the point where soon, I'm gonna be more than just slightly obese. 

I tend to do quite well during the day, but that's because I'm busy at work. I will have breakfast, which is cereal or toast and an apple and coffee. For my first break at work I usually have a cereal bar and an orange. My lunch is usually an instant noodle or left over food from dinner the night before. And on my third break I tend to have a little piece of chocolate. 

When I get home, I make tea. Usually rice with something or pasta, or some soup and bread. I do tend to have at least one kind of vegetable in every meal. However after tea, I can't stop myself. I'm just eating everything in sight. Biscuits, chocolate, crisps, yogurt. I tend to avoid the fruit, however. I'm not even that hungry, just eating for the sake of eating. I've started using my fitness Pal and have noticed I average eating about 3500 calories per day, double what my target is for me to lose weight. 

I know I maybe need something to keep me busy, but I get bored very quickly so if I take a hobby up, I quickly lose interest and don't do it anymore, or I can eat while doing it anyway. I told myself, today is gonna be the day I take better care of myself. But straight after having my tea, I ate 5 little chocolate bars, 2 packets of crisps and some caramel treats, and I still feel like I want to eat more. I feel disgusted at myself afterwards everytime I overeat like this, but I still do it every day. However I also tend to find, even when I do eat healthier, I feel hungrier. 

I'm seeing my husband in 10 days. I've gained more weight since I last saw him but I can't stop myself from eating, no matter how hard I try. I have no self control or willpower at all. Does anyone have any advice at how to start? Thank you for any help."
11,fp,"My 18 year old daughter (lives with her mom) was recently diagnosed.  She has gone through profound stressors in the past six months (a complicated tonsillectomy, slow death of her stepfather, first year of college) and hid this from her mother and I, mostly to protect her mother from additional stress while her husband succumbed to a terminal illness.  I knew she was losing weight but it was so gradual that I did not realize it was a problem until recently. 

Mom is sort of emotionally frazzled, understandably so, so I need to step up even more.  I would appreciate hearing from younger women how they would have liked their dads to support them.  What is helpful to hear?  What is not helpful to hear?  What should I do and not do?  I really appreciate your insight.  

Daughter is going to enter a partial hospitalization treatment program soon, but I will be around for her as much as I can.  Thank you."
12,fp,"I understand a lot of weight loss is tied to exercise so imma focus on that as well, but I was not taught good eating habits by my parents. (Not blaming just taking responsibility for my own life)"
