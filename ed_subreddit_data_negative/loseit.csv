What losing 80 pounds in a year does to your face.,1883,sx2xhl,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx2xhl/what_losing_80_pounds_in_a_year_does_to_your_face/,63,"I started really trying to lose last year in March. I realized I wanted my daughter to grow up with healthy habits and a healthy role model. I've gone from 303 to 224, 44 waist to 34 waist, XXL to L, 19 inch nech to 16.5. I did CICO and volumetrics with noom. I did no exercise except for walking the dog twice a day and playing woth my daughter for the first 6 months. I then added bodyweight exercises and in the last two months, yoga(which I am LOVING).

My biggest takeaways so far. Eating breakfast helped me a lot. I used to skip it and I'd be so hungry at lunch that I would massively over eat. Bananas are amazing. 100 calories and so filling, I go through 2 a day most days. Seasonal fruits are also an awesome treat. I picked peaches this summer and they were sweeter and more delicious than any candy bar. Meal delivery services. Really easy to track the calories and every dish has vegetables. 

Where do I go from here? I want to lose 20 to 30 more pounds and keep getting stronger. Im 6'2"", so 195 is likely my sweet spot. I had a goal of 1 pull-up by January 1 and I did it! I'd like to be able to do 5 in a row by next January.  [https://imgur.com/a/WakEV4T](https://imgur.com/a/WakEV4T)",1645368858.0
41lbs over 2 years! My secret? Treating my mental health issues.,860,sx3aqs,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx3aqs/41lbs_over_2_years_my_secret_treating_my_mental/,28,"[Before/After Photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/w71JVZC)

As long as I can remember I have struggled with depression, anxiety and adhd. Growing up with a brain that is constantly seeking out dopamine, food becomes a very reliable source and stimulant. For me this turned into deeply engrained habits of stress/boredom eating, especially things with sugar and high carbs that boost dopamine levels the most.

In mid 2020 my depression had gotten to the point that it was debilitating. Like a lot of people, lockdown really sent my mental health into a spiral. At my lowest, I reached out and found a therapist. And it has truly changed my life. 

With her help and guidance, I started an antidepressant that actually works for me, I left a toxic long term relationship, and I’m starting to set healthy habits like meditating and exercising for my brain instead of my body. My goal with therapy was never weight loss, but treating my underlying issues took away my need for stress and boredom snacking. It has also helped me regain control over what I’m choosing to eat, and has helped lessen my ‘motivation block’ for going to the gym.

And on top of all that, I don’t even hate my life or myself anymore. Losing weight in the past was always a huge stressor on my mental health, now it has become a byproduct of working on my mental health.

TLDR; Started therapy, stoped hating myself, and weight loss followed.",1645369906.0
(26/male) Does being overweight make you feel like you aren’t good enough to find a partner?,60,sxcxo2,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sxcxo2/26male_does_being_overweight_make_you_feel_like/,31,"As I’m on this journey alone, I constantly feel this way about myself.

Hey all, started my weight loss journey on 16th August 2021. While I had Covid I had a stroke at 34 years old and was also diagnosed with sleep apnea. I got very depressed and hit my heaviest ever weight of 258.4lbs. I was on blood pressure meds, prediabetic, high cholesterol and liver levels were bad too. I was getting bad back pain and was struggling to do normal things without puffing. 

I made a decision to start my health journey in mid August, and just hit 64lbs lost so thought I would post my 6 month progress in the hopes it will encourage people, especially if you are feeling hopeless like I was. I have looked at progress posts here and at the Intermittent Fasting subreddit everyday the previous 6 months and been so motivated by them. Thank you all for the advice and encouragement I have found here daily! 

I have been losing weight through intermittent fasting combined with calorie control/eating lots of veggies. 

I have a long way to go to get to my goal weight but I’m enjoying the journey!",1645384551.0
"Lost 57lbs over the last 10 months after a mini midlife crisis. Can’t believe the difference it made to my appearance, confidence, and overall quality of life.",120,sx534r,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx534r/lost_57lbs_over_the_last_10_months_after_a_mini/,10,"https://imgur.com/a/cLK6mmc


Top was 2018 and not even at my heaviest, the bottom was me couple of weeks ago. Currently 30 (M). It’s crazy, you wouldn’t guess it but the person in the first picture is 4 years younger. 

Last year around April things ended with my long term SO who I have been with for over 5 years, the relationship was done way before that. I was 207 lbs (5 ft 10), eating crap, pulling all nighters before work playing games. The break up was the kick up the backside that I needed to get my shit together. 

Initially started slow, it was just cutting out snacks and sweet treats. Then I incorporated 16/8 intermittent fasting along with a small calorie deficit, this is where I lost the bulk of the weight, from 207 to 170. No exercise at all during this period because I just hated it to be honest.

Then I went through a period of plateau. This is when I hired a personal trainer, it was quite pricy but i really needed someone to keep me accountable in order to go to the gym and I felt doing it right from the start with the proper guidance would work out better in the long run. It was definitely worth it imho, I saw my PT twice a week for 10 weeks and lost another 15 pounds, he taught me about the importance of NEAT which is basically passive calorie burning through steps. Most importantly I actually really started enjoying the gym, the endorphins that’s released after a good sesh as you sit down in the changing room listening to some hype tunes is addictive.

Currently trying to average 2200 calories per day (averaging over a week in order to account for high calorie situations like a night out), going to the gym 3 times a week, and 1 session of a sport I like (usually squash or badminton). Lost another 5 lbs in the last two months so currently 150 and the goal is to get a 6 pack before I’m 31, vain I know but it’s nice to have a goal.

Recently got promoted at work, closing on a new property, feeling fantastic. Life is firmly back on track! Still looking for that special someone but I’m confident it’s a just a matter of time.",1645374713.0

* By far the biggest breakthrough for me was finding a type of exercise I actually enjoyed. I discovered bicycling, which allowed me to get outside and enjoy nice weather. I started out by riding on an old-man style bike for 10 minutes around the block. I naturally and gradually wanted to do more rather than forcing myself.
* Running is a nightmare for me and I associated my dislike of running with all exercise. I never thought I would be an active/fit person, but it turns out I just hate running. So I don't run. Trying to run would make me dread exercising and sabotage my system. 
* I stopped drinking alcohol several months before the ""before"" picture. I was even heavier than that (got up to 240 or so), but don't have pictures of that. I've only drank maybe 4-5 times in the past year, and I feel great. Alcohol was a major cause of my obesity and I feel so much healthier having given it up. And once you give it up, you see how much drinking is going on in society and it's a bit shocking.
* I didn't change my diet right away. I instead set time limits around when I would eat, which is basically intermittent fasting. But I ate whatever I wanted during that time. Eventually, I cut out/cut back on certain foods. 
* For example, after 4 months I cut out my nightly huge bowl of ice cream and replaced it with a bowl of fiber-filled cereal. It wasn't a big change but I wanted to do it and it got me over a plateau.
* After 11 months I cut down on eating chips/crackers/cookies. I said I could have up to 500 calories of chips/crackers/cookies per day, but no more. BUT I could still eat whatever else I wanted. So I was just replacing shitty junk food with food that still tasted good, but wasn't totally empty calories.
* Again, these diet changes happened LONG after I lost a lot of weight, and were really just useful to bust plateaus.
* My health stats are looking good. I have young kids and want to be around for a long time, so health has become increasingly important to me as I've gotten closer to 40. My resting heart rate is around 45 and my lab bloodwork all looks good. I also have more energy and better mental health. The mentality improvement of being in better shape is real. I approach life with much more joy and confidence.
* I am pretty skinny now, so I've started going to the gym this winter. Looking forward to building muscle and getting studly!",1645294489.0
"[Update/Progress] From Fat to Skinny to Somewhat Fit + An Eating Disorder (M/25/5'10"")",16,sx9z10,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx9z10/updateprogress_from_fat_to_skinny_to_somewhat_fit/,2,"Been a long time since I've been on here. [Here is my original post, years and years ago.] (https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/6ov395/have\_i\_gained\_any\_muscle/) I was thinking back and wanted to come on here and update a few things. I always liked seeing update posts, so I figured I'd do my part and give mine. I wasn't originally posting here, but I used to read and lurk a lot during this time period, so I figured I'd post here as well.

&#x200B;

&nbsp;

I honestly don't really know where to start an update on this. So much has changed from my original post. Not only in terms of my fitness but mindset, goals, life, ...everything. If you saw the original post, back when I first posted it, I don't think I responded to a single comment. I didn't know what to say. Not only that, I think part of me didn't believe what people were telling me. Being fat for a while, especially in undergrad where many things were judged solely based on first looks, I thought skinny is all I wanted to be and what was ""attractive"" and my goal. That manifested in me just dieting and restricting calories extremely. I didn't think anything I was doing was too crazy at first. Just cut out junk, and went for lower-calorie options. Then everything became about the lower calorie option. After a year or so of that, of course, you'll lose mad weight. It got to the point where I hardly ever felt extremely hungry or extremely full, rarely ever felt sad or happy or many emotions (I can only say this looking back, though this could be due to several factors.) 

&nbsp;

After that post, I sort of had nowhere to go but up. Figuratively and literally. At 115lbs and 5'10"", there isn't much more you can lose. To be honest, I never made the connection of how rigid I was with things until I went through some really hard times shortly after which inherently caused me to put on some weight. During this time period, I stopped calorie counting, just ate, and went hard at the gym. I was mentally exhausted from all the other things going on in my life and life changes to have the mental discipline to also calorie count and be stringent about my diet.

&nbsp;

After about 6 months to a year of that, I was able to find a middle ground where I could take on the challenges in my life, but also make controllable and meaningful steps towards fitness goals. And that's where things started falling into place. I shifted more to just focused and effective workouts. Got into cycling as a hobby/sport and as a means to be able to gain fitness, stay active, and burn calories without it feeling like a chore and something I HAD to do. I learned that I was no longer just some 20-year-old guy with nothing but school and gym. But had other things going on in life that required my attention, and that capacity was limited. Coming from a place where very little of this was taught, fitness and feelings weren't much of a thing, it took a lot of growth outside of just the gym to realize and learn these things.

&nbsp;

Don't get me wrong it's still something that I struggle with on and off. But I definitely feel more equipped and prepared to handle things as I gained experience, learned, and just experimented with things. It was just as much a mental/mindset shift, as it was a physical shift. It became more than just how I looked, the attention I got for losing weight, or a number on a scale, and shifted to being more about how I felt, what was healthy and sustainable for that period of my life, and quite honestly how I wanted to view myself as a cohesive person/individual. I don't know if this is the kind of post this subreddit sees these days, but just thought I'd look back for a bit and share some of my experiences. Probably different than most posts I remember where people posted diet numbers, recipes, workout routines, etc. I remember getting lost in all that and thinking that was all that mattered -- but this is just as important in my opinion. Didn't realize what that meant until I went through it.  

&nbsp;

I'll try to stick around this time to answer any questions or just expand more if anyone is interested.",1645387377.0

I haven't weighed myself yesterday or today, since the five beers I have had since Friday probably caused some water retention. Today I am not drinking and I will be carefully tracking again and I'll hop back on the scale tomorrow. 

Only drinking five beers all week has been such a huge accomplishment for me, considering I used to put back 3 12-pack IPAs every week before that.

Three or four months ago I started eating healthier in a calorie deficit. I also decided to occasionally walk out to the warehouse and get some extra steps in for the day. Not many, but better than sitting at my desk for 8 hours. Back then I’d struggle to get up one aisle & back down the next.

I feel like a hypocrite,5,sxew7y,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sxew7y/i_feel_like_a_hypocrite/,2,"I (23F) weighed myself for the first time in a year and was completely disgusted and disappointed by the number. When I started undergrad I was around 135 and even then I wasn't happy with how I looked. Fast forward 5ish years and I'm officially 160 despite being only 5'3 and I'm just so upset with myself...I knew I had gained weight but reaching the +25 lbs ""milestone"" really put things into perspective for me.

My issue is that I know exactly why I've gained the weight but idk how to fix it. Becoming a competitive medical school applicant meant devoting 100% of my efforts towards my studies. I was under a lot of stress, ate the comfort foods I probably shouldn't have, and was so mentally exhausted that I rarely had the energy to exercise. Any extra time I had was spent with friends or sleeping. In short, every time I had to choose between focusing on my studies or my health, I chose my studies. My fear is that I'll need to continue prioritizing my studies over myself as I grow closer to becoming a physician, so I wont be able to put an end to this cycle and my health will just continue to deteriorate.  

On one hand, I think devoting all that time to my work helped me become qualified enough to go to med school. On the other hand, how can I help people be the healthiest version of themselves when I can't be the healthiest version of myself?? How can I encourage people to make good lifestyle decisions despite the stressors in their lives when I clearly can't make good lifestyle choices in the same situations? And how ironic is it that learning about health is quite literally ruining own health lol. I just feel like it's hypocritical for me to lecture others about their health related mistakes when I clearly don't have my own health under control. 

Obviously I want to lose the weight I've gained, but I need a more sustainable way to keep myself in check during med school. I gain weight when I'm stressed (thanks genetics!) and the next 4-10 years are gonna be hella stressful. I 100% use food as my escape which I know is bad, and I know I need to do a better job of working exercise back into my life. I feel like my limiting factors are time and energy and idk how to deal with either. I'm hoping to start developing some good habits that I can take with me to med school and I would really appreciate advice on what changes I can make and how I can improve. Thanks for letting me rant :') 



TLDR: I (23F) gained 25lbs (135 -> 160) and am really disappointed in myself. I'm starting medical school in the fall and feel like it's hypocritical for me to be a physician and point out my patients health mistakes when I can't even control my own weight.",1645400679.0
I don't understand why I am so skinny fat compared to most people even though I eat right and am active.,11,sx6qgz,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx6qgz/i_dont_understand_why_i_am_so_skinny_fat_compared/,114,"   
I'm a female. 32 years old. No kids. I am 5'0 and currently 125lbs.

I am very skinny fat. With clothes on I look good, but without clothes I have a really gross potbelly, a muffin top, my thighs and ass are huge, I have flappy ARM WINGS.....I am just extremely jiggly. I don't know why I am like this. My job is really active, I am a vet tech and I am on my feet for 8+ hours a day. On the weekends I ride my bike usually 7-10 miles. My diet I have always thought is pretty healthy compared to most people....an example of my day:

Breakfast:

1) Either 2 eggs over medium, coffee with cream and sugar. This is the only time I allow myself to ""drink calories"".

2) 1 egg over medium on a piece of toasted Ezekiel bread with avocado. Either coffee with cream and sugar or tea with honey. Again, only meal I drink calories.

Lunch:

A lot of times it's a Lean Cuisine meal, they run around 250-400 calories.

Dinner:

Normally I eat chicken, either a grilled breast or a thigh, ALWAYS a vegetable like broccoli or asparagus, or a small salad with a small amount of dressing. For a starch a small portion of mashed potatoes (Like Bob Evans) or I will bake a sweet potato.

This is basically it guys......on weekends I will splurge and eat a little more, make worse choices like pizza, or make a big sunday breakfast......but I seem to keep it in control most of the time. I find it hard to believe the weekends derail me that badly.

I just don't understand why I am primarily fat. I am weak. I am fat. My diet is not THAT bad.

When I cut calories to lose weight I lose WEIGHT easy, but I am still fat. I can get down to 115lbs easily but still jiggle all over and have a huge potbelly and thighs and a muffin top. I even have a stationary bike, that I used to use daily....I got down to 115lbs, but guess what, I looked no different, pant size did not change, and I was still fat.

I don't see myself as someone who is going to lift weights daily. I get home from work and I am exhausted.

I feel like I eat better and am more active than most people, yet most people still look better than me. Is it because I am so short? I just don't know what I need to be doing.

I’m so glad to be here. My weight has been an issue my entire life I’m sure like most people. Something clicked and I finally am really SICK and tired of being overweight. A lot of people say I carry my weight so well (whatever that means) and sometimes I wish people were more honest with me because it has led me to just keep eating and eating if that makes sense. 
Anyways in the past when I was trying to be in a calorie deficit one bad meal would make me really lose it and I’d go down the rabbit hole. Not this time. I went to Olive Garden and got a little “out of control”  which these days seems to be something simple as an extra breadstick. I didn’t let that take me off course. It feels amazing. I just wanted to share that. Im in the beginning of my journey and I feel like it’s one of the most important times to stay on track. Thank you for reading. 

I am a little nervous because next weekend is ladies night and that means drinking and I’d like to partake. Does anyone have any drink recommendations that won’t mess things up to bad? I’m open to anything",1645399256.0

However, next month I have two separate business trips that are each a week long. I'm extremely nervous about how I'm going to calorie count while traveling.  

I will be staying at a string of different accomodations, only one of which has a full kitchen. I do plan to cook the two days I'm staying there, but I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do the other 12 days. Most of the places have at least a mini fridge, though. 

I do plan to bring along some protein bars and hopefully buy some low cal snacks I can carry around with me once I fly in (I'm thinking fruits, string cheeses, maybe some grab and go salads.) I can also eat at fast food places that at least have a calorie count available for me so I can make smart decisions. 

However, it is inevitable that I will have to meet with various clients for dinner at restaurants without posted nutrition information. I will eliminate any alcohol or appetizer snacking, but I'm wondering what kind of main course decisions to make? Salads and fish or chicken/vegetable entrees, I'm thinking, but how do I estimate my calories for those? Is that possible or will I just have to accept I can't know for sure and try to limit myself?

I knew things had to change I didn’t know how drastic things had to change today. My doctor diagnosed me with pre-diabetes which pretty much meant that I was on the low end of A-1 C scale.

So a little bit about me I’ve been in the banking industry for 22 years so it’s a very sedentary job. My typical day consisted of skipping breakfast and having a fast food lunch or bringing two sandwiches and chips to work for lunch and then a high carb dinner. I was drinking a lot of soda mostly diet but occasionally regular. And then at night time I would be snacking on chip so I would eat probably a bag of chips.

So over the past two weeks since my doctor’s visit I’ve made some changes to my diet I’ve started eating three meals a day the doctor also put me on some Metformin medication to help with the pre-diabetes. I’ve also tried to cut out all sugar out of my diet I am using the sugar substitute Splenda. I haven’t had any junk food or sweets or fast food. As of today I am down 11 pounds which feels good but I know that I need to keep this journey going so that’s why I join this community.

Almost every time I go to his desk I grab a handful and throw them back while I talk through work stuff.  I do this at least once a day….But doing it three times durning the day wouldn’t be out of the ordinary.

I took a handful the other day and actually counted them to put them in my counter.  It was only 8 of them….when I put them in my calculator it came out to be 80 calories….which didn’t seem like a lot.  Then yesterday I realized I did it three times….240 calories.

I went back and realized over the course of this week I had consumed almost 750 calories of absent minded candy.  

I work 50 weeks a year.  That’s 37,500 calories a year.  Over 10 pounds of calories a year.

Pre pregnancy weight: 195
Day I had the baby: 267
Today: 195
Goal weight: 175

5’8’’ 33(f)


I don’t believe in “snapback” culture but damn if I’m not proud of myself for losing the weight I put on during pregnancy. If you’re familiar with recommendations during pregnancy you might notice that I gained nearly triple the recommended amount of weight to gain during a pregnancy. 

This was my second baby so I had a bit more of an idea of what to expect. I’m also damn lucky I have had two uncomplicated and unmedicated births with breezy recovery. This last time I didn’t even tear so I was cleared for exercise at 2 weeks postpartum 

How I did the damn thing:

- breastfeeding (doesn’t help everyone but I think I burn 300-500 calories a day making milk)

- exercise: started with low impact rowing, biking, and walking. I started running when my son was cleared to go in the jogger at six months. I exercise every single day for at least 20 minutes.  Recently started training for a half marathon so now I’m running 8+ miles at once! The baby loves the fresh air, and I feel so much better physically and mentally.

-nutrition: I have to intuitively eat/eat enough or I feel like I might risk my milk supply. I always eat if I’m hungry even if it’s more than a typical day in case the baby is just growing. I eat a 80% grain free diet due to an annoying autoimmune disease but I think I intake about 1800kcal a day based on past counting. 


If you’re struggling with postpartum body image please know you aren’t alone! I could barely look at myself that first week postpartum because I was so embarrassed about gaining 70lb. Now I feel like a badass who gained AND lost 70lb. 

I took ten months to put it on and ten months to take off. Oh and grew, birthed and nourished a whole new human! How was I ever disappointed in myself?",1645387613.0

I know I need to do self care, that I’m punishing my own self, yada yada.

CICO and TDEE,5,sx5wlh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx5wlh/cico_and_tdee/,0,"There have been many posts recently about finding the correct TDEE to use. Here is what is working FOR ME. I use the Nutritionix Track app and associated web site. 
I plugged in my stats and it comes up with a recommended daily calorie limit for weight loss. Compared with online TDEE calculators this appears to use ""sedentary"" activity level with a 500 calorie deficit, the ""standard"" for 1 lb/wk weight loss.

I carefully enter all food consumed, my exercise, and daily weigh-ins right after I wake up and use the toilet. For me, exercise is usually daily elliptical, planking, and a dog walk. Other than that, I am sedentary. There have been a few sessions of heavy snow shoveling in there, too.

The app has a daily ""remaining"" calories tracker, which is the difference between what you have already consumed and the sum of recommended and exercise calories. I tried to keep my daily intake below or slightly above the recommend intake (about 1740 for me) and NOT eat back my exercise calories, though sometimes I went up to 200 calories over that.

After a month, here's what I found. I averaged the ""remaining"" calories per day, added 500 (the built-in calorie deficit), divided this sum by 500 (the deficit needed for 1 lb/wk weight loss). This came to a predicted weight loss of 1.85 lbs/wk. My ACTUAL weight loss during this period averages out to 2.15 lb/wk. That's pretty damn close. This tells me the exercise calories estimated are pretty accurate, at least for me and the exercise I do. 

I started using this method 2 weeks after I started (and quit) a very low calorie (1000) plan that dropped me 10 lbs in 2 weeks, but left me feeling like crap. Since then, the loss has been slow and steady.

TLDR; use sedentary TDEE and add in accurate estimate of actual exercise calories.",1645376837.0

Then after that, I'll be on what I consider my ""Final"" cut to hit my goal weight. I know that the last 20-25lbs will be a pain to lose but fuck am I happy that I've kept at it and noticing the results beyond my physique. I've had few  moments of body dysmorphia where I discredited my progress because I looked bloated one day but it didn't happen often.

I've had lows, in fact last 2 weeks have been slacking on the exercise side of things I've been slacking on my workout schedule... and I've allowed myself more ""cheat"" food... I'd call those 2 weeks a success either way since I still lost 1.5 lbs each of those week, but I was on a calorie deficit burnout and needed to allow myself some cravings.... somehow managed to still be at a deficit lol.

Keep at it people, especially those of you who wonders if this is all worth it. Trust me, you will notice in your every day life that you are more happy, better state of mind, in many ways more flexible after a while and healthier overall.

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 20, 2022",14,swyv62,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swyv62/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_20_2022/,5,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

Repost from r/Fitness. Need help with weight loss.,2,sxc5wj,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sxc5wj/repost_from_rfitness_need_help_with_weight_loss/,5,"The mods at r/Fitness redirected me here.

So it's finally happened. The thing I never wanted. I've hit 300lbs. I won't bore you with the details, but a series of medical issues have kept me sedentary for the better part of 3 years. I'm physically able to do things now with no issue. In fact, I went on a fairly long hike through roughish terrain the other day and was very happy that by the end of it, I felt fine. I never felt like stopping or got out of breath (except when you'd expect to, like going up steep inclines, and even then it wasn't ""out of breath"" and more like ""started breathing harder"".)

I have also now gotten a driving job that has me spend most of my time, well, driving. So I'm on my ass for most of the time and am working 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week. My driving takes me far from home for up to 2 weeks at a time. As a consequence, I eat a lot of drive through/fast casual.

So I'm looking for some help in what I can do to reverse this. I know I'm looking at a year+ of consistency, but I just don't know where to start. Any help or insight would be appreciated. I did look at the wiki, but I think I need some more specific recommendations to help me with my weight loss.

Here's a brief overview of my past habits.

* I've always been overweight, but this is the worst it's been. I've been consistently between 250-260lbs. A healthy weight would be around 230lbs.

* I did work out regular in the past. I lifted weights and was pretty good at it. Not strongman stuff, but moving heavy things has never been a problem for me. This might have contributed somewhat to my weight gain. A friend of my once politely said ""I wear my weight well."" I still have a lot of muscle on me, but I'm probably at the tipping point of ""wearing my weight well"".

* I really do hate aerobic exercises. At my best I could jog 3/4-1mile (I was basing it off Google maps, so I never got an exact length) without stopping. But that was a trial.

* I have standard American eating preferences, with the exception that I don't eat seafood and usually prefer raw vegetables.

A big thing that I could use help with is what I could eat on the road? Are there places I could go that offer healthy food? I can't really make prepared meals since I won't have a refrigerator, nor consistent access to an oven/stove. I don't always get a microwave at the places I stay. Stoping and getting food from grocery stores would be fine, but what could I eat that doesn't need cooking? Is the deli baked chicken a good option? I've had it, and it all seems pretty greasy to me.

Any workouts that I could do? I've been thinking about taking a sledgehammer with me and restarting doing Indian Mace exercises.

Any help would be thoroughly appreciated. I really am at a loss on what to do.",1645393233.0
My appetite is completely gone...,1,sxgvgw,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sxgvgw/my_appetite_is_completely_gone/,0,"Hey everyone! Wondering if anyone has experienced this?

Title basically says it all!

Over the past two weeks I’ve found eating to be such a freaking chore! Even when I do experience physical hunger I eat maybe four or five bites and then I’m done.

I don’t ever want anything and can barely finish a meal.

Has anyone experienced this while losing weight? Is this common?

For context I’ve been on a weight loss journey since October (28F, 5’6”, SW: 179lbs) and am now down over 20 lbs (so fluctuating in the high 150s).

Since October, I’ve also been hardcore working out, boxing (5-6 times a week), running (2-3 times a week but currently on pause because of shin splints but I’m subbing in other cardio), and weightlifting (1-2 times a week). Note: I know this sounds like a lot, but I worked up to it and have been very athletic in my past.

I try to average about 1600-2000 cals/day (on rest days 1400) and hit 130g-140g protein minimum. Lately it’s just been so hard to eat even my rest day calories! 

This is super odd for me because I’ve always had a massive appetite (bottomless pit type level) and would eat wayyyy past satiety. 

In terms of overall well-being I feel fantastic! I just have to force down food have never experience this lack of hunger ever before. 

Would love to hear any experiences, suggestions, etc.

Thank you!!",1645406397.0

"Teach me, I need help. Weight training addition.",2,sxbvx0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sxbvx0/teach_me_i_need_help_weight_training_addition/,2,"Hi! So I am 40F 5'4.5 currently 136 lbs. I just asked a question on another OPs post and then realized I should just make my own!

In 2015 I was 201 lbs, I got real with myself and lost 30 lbs, maintained for a while, lost another 25, gained some back and was back up to 180 after 3 weeks of lockdown in Spring of 2020 (I also had 2 pregnancies/babies before 2015 and 2 after). I got back to losing and got to 137 in June of 2021 (my goal was 139). I have been maintaining between 135-138 ever since. I keep thinking I would like to get to 130 but then I think I actually like how I look and I'm just comparing myself to others. 

So I think I would like to do a little body recomp. I am a runner and currently running between 30-40 miles a week (usually 5 days of running 1 full rest day and one day of cross training on the stationary bike). I also have been sporadically doing squats, pushups and 5lb weights (no real schedule sometimes 3 times a week sometimes only once). I have a good amount of muscle in my legs and have noticed some in my arms since starting pushups. Currently I can do 10 actual good form pushups before failure. . 

I don't have time to go to the gym but I could maybe invest in some home weights but I don't have a ton of money to spend. Any advice would be really appreciated about what would be the best to get and how often I should be doing strength training. I am not willing to run less. 

Oh also I am currently eating at maintenance and focusing on getting at least 120 grams of protein a day. 

Thanks!",1645392485.0

Finally back at it (for the 4th time and I’m not mad about it!) here’s my story,4,sx5jfy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx5jfy/finally_back_at_it_for_the_4th_time_and_im_not/,2,"I have gained weight and lose weight/healthy exercise routine three times now over the last 10 years. I’m F/29/5’6” currently 180. At my best was 138lbs @ 14% bf in 2016! I usually stay around 155-160 in maintenance and am happy there. Some of this may be TMI but I don’t talk about it to anyone except my mom and doctors and it feels good to talk about it in a community somewhat anonymous. I’ve notoriously been the fit and healthy one my whole life. I loved the gym and just preferred clean food. I am from the north east my husband is from the south so our preferred foods/diets are different. He drinks Pepsi I drink tea and water. He eats burgers and spaghetti and Wendy’s and I eat what he calls “bougie” salads and Lean meats/veggies. Our whole marriage I’ve cooked two separate meals for both of us. We moved to his hometown for a job he wanted with an old friend and I struggled to find work in my field. It’s just not prominent in this area. I bartended and worked at the local court for a while but ended up quitting and finished my degree then I found a job I loved but it was out of town for a few weeks twice a year. The whole time i was gone he said do what makes me happy he was glad I had a job I loved and it paid really well. We bought a house I bought him a truck for his job it was great. Well, this last year I gained 30lbs after learning he had a messy affair with a close friend of his family who lives around the block from the house we just bought last year. I didn’t plan to be in his hometown but it just happened so we did. I don’t have family here and it’s a pretty small town so I only have a few friends outside the social circle he is in. Apparently the whole town and his family knew. It was his sisters best friend and she went as far as showing up to my house screaming at me for staying and him not being with her. I was calm handling it until she faked a pregnancy dragged out taking a test for two weeks to try and get him to be with her and push me away. She lived in my house while I was away and brought her kids and said they treated him like a father. I have a daughter it was her best friends. The details are pretty painful. It was hard to say the least so I’m not beating myself up for just surviving after it came to light. Initially I left and stayed at a friends farm alone to calm down. Then to my moms for support. I decided to come back and fix our family. Obviously she wasn’t pregnant. He kept her around while I was gone up until hours before i got home. I could be wrong or dumb for staying but it’s the choice I made. I already struggle with a lot of medical/MH issues and we live in his hometown so it was lonely and made a lot of those issues flare up. Choosing to stay and work through was difficult but my decision and I believe in our vows and decided to stay together. We have been married for 10 years and built a family and I don’t think a mistake is worth throwing that all away if there is still love and connection in our marriage. We’re all human life is hard enough and mistakes happen bad choices get made but he’s my best friend and I have faith it won’t happen again. If it does I’ll be at peace with it and continue living life toward my dreams and goals independently but either I’m finally at peace with things for the most part now and able to focus on myself again heal those wounds and move forward. On another note my husband has always been a heavy drinker so I ended up falling into the habit and it got pretty bad. I was so depressed i couldn’t cook or get off my couch or shower for months it was a dark time with lots of fast food and junk. Anyways, I’m finally back on track cleaned up my diet drink more water and cut alcohol again completely! I haven’t found motivation to work out yet but I’m confident it will come with time. A small NSV is I’m on my second week alcohol free! Im less anxious and have a clearer head/more energy I’m taking care of myself and cooking/cleaning more involved with friends and as a parent. I have lost some weight and fit back into a pair of jeans I couldn’t get past my thighs four weeks ago. I feel pretty good! I also feel more sure of myself. My goal is to be comfortable confident and strong again not really a scale number specifically. I’ll get there!",1645375919.0

Could use some encouragement on weight loss,10,swzkms,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swzkms/could_use_some_encouragement_on_weight_loss/,9,"Hello all

I just really need some encouragement on losing some weight. I've struggled with it my entire life, but the last year or so has been particularly bad.

The pandemic hasn't helped, but also my only parent had a stroke about 5 months ago and I am have been their temporary full time caretaker and moved in with them until they move to assisted living in the next week. After that, I'm going to be living alone again and changing a lot in my life.

I'm 29, m, 5'8"" and just about 300lbs. I look pretty good at 220, and I'm aiming to lose 80 pounds hopefully over the next two years at most.

I'm an alcoholic, but planning on cutting that out as much as possible and have a plan for it. I'm also going to go vegetarian again, which I've done for years at a time but not within the last couple years, as my last job was a line cook at a french restaurant.

Currently I do intermittent fasting and I only consume any calories within 6 hours per day, but that apparently has not helped. I usually eat one meal of about 1000 calories, have a small meal of about 600 and then drink a case of white claw. Food total I keep to about 1600, but add on about 1200-2000 more in alcohol if I have wine as well.

I'm planning on cutting the alcohol consumption by around half at first and see where I go from there, and switching to a plant based diet. I work out about 20 minutes a day at home, mostly bodyweight exercises (60 pushups, 20 situps, 40 alternating lunges, 20 jumping jacks) but that has not seemed to help.

Mostly my plan is to start by cutting my alcohol intake and meat at first, then probably going vegan and possibly getting entirely sober.

I got very suicidal today when I realized how big I was compared to two years ago, and I just need to change something.

Tldr: I'm just looking for encouragement. I have a plan to improve things and I just want some support.",1645357624.0

"After months of struggling with Binge Eating, I am finally losing weight again!",82,swng4z,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swng4z/after_months_of_struggling_with_binge_eating_i_am/,12,"25M 5'11 SW 352 CW 179 GW 165

I will leave a TLDR at the bottom bc this is a bit lengthy.

I went from 352lbs down to 182 lbs in my first year of dieting! In the following 3 months I gained and lost the same 5 lbs over and over and over due to binge eating. I am so close to my goal weight of 165 so this has been hard for me to deal with.

In the first 7-8 months, it was easy for me being in a massive calorie deficit, my sheer determination and will power to restrict calories was huge let me tell you. I actually enjoyed the feeling of an empty stomach, and feeling my stomach rumble lol it sounds weird ik. The weight just melted off. But then I started feeling hungrier and hungrier. I started needing more and more ""cheat days"" and the cheat days turned from a couple thousand extra calories, to a few thousand and so on. Then i started needing multiple cheat days every week. My weight loss slowed further and further. Until eventually it halted. From November to February I had a net loss of zero lbs. And I didn't realized I was developing a binge eating disorder.

November to February: I would Heavily restrict my calories as usual (1500 calories a day) then by the end of the week I couldn't take it, and would binge eat anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 calories a couple or even a few days in a row. I would see weight gain on the scale, get freaked out and scared to gain weight back, get really determined, and begin heavily restricting again. Rinse and repeat. The guilt i would feel after binge eating made me feel so horrible about myself. It actually started giving me anxiety and I couldn't stop thinking about food and dieting. I felt trapped in a way. Those who binge can relate I'm sure. When I binged, the feeling was just awful. I felt so insatiable just in full starving mode. Like a zombie craving flesh.

I lost my weight by massively cutting, it's all i knew, all I thought would work for me. Slower weight loss sounded scary because 1 of my binges could easily ruin a full week's progress... 3 weeks ago I decided I would trust in those ridiculously insane ppl who are ok with the idea of losing ONLY 1 lb a week (lol.) So I started eating at a much smaller deficit. I'm thinking my deficit is somewhere between 400-500 calories. It's hard to figure these things out precisely but I have lost nearly 3 lbs in the last few weeks. I am 179 lbs (lowest I've ever been since probably middle school) and I am happy to say the bingeing behaviors are completely gone! I do have moments where I'm a bit hungry sure, (after all, I'm still in a deficit) but it's not agonizing, not even close to the miserable feeling I used to feel. And some nights I do go to bed feeling very mildly hungry, more like minor cravings. But I feel comfort in the fact that I can now eat a proper sized meal when I wake up :) Sometimes I'm not hungry at all. Which is new for me XD Food is no longer ALWAYS on mind  I can eat more of the foods I enjoy. I have been making sure to hit my protein goal, then eat whatever i want to fill out the rest of my calories. It's amazing. My body feels the best it's ever felt, I have had more energy, my sleep has even improved, my weightlifting sessions I feel like I can go harder. Since I don't binge anymore I never have to deal with significant bloating and looking 30 lbs heavier the next day! And I GET TO EAT. Omg I get to freaking eat! I'm an absolute idiot for not eating at a more sustainable deficit. It's not a race. And I will reach my goal weight before I know it! 


TLDR: Eating at a big calorie deficit worked for me for a good while but eventually caused me to begin binge eating pretty severely. I stopped making any weight loss progress because of it. I am now eating at a much smaller deficit and the weight loss has resumed! I feel incredible!

I am excited to get this off my chest because I've been struggling with it so much physically and mentally! And I've finally overcome it!

Edit: I think a lot of us who have struggled with Binge eating are too afraid to try eating at a small deficit because we know if we binge JUST ONCE we could destroy a whole weeks effort just like that. None of us ever plan on bingeing, but it still happens. So we lose trust in ourselves. It's hard to explain. But if you are one of these ppl like me. Trust in yourself, your body will not feel hungry enough to want to binge on a small deficit. It's just not. And slower weight loss is infinitely better than none at all. We will get there. The first couple days are probably going to be tough, because our ""ALL OR NOTHING"" Brains aren't used to a medium amount of food. But you will see that dieting is much more enjoyable this way. I ate a Reese's Candy Bar today and Chocolate cereal this morning. Is that remotely healthy, probably not, but I did eat a shit load of yummy fruits and veggies, hit my protein goal and still have 200 calories remaining. Gonna drink a couple shots of whiskey to celebrate. Lol",1645314878.0

Anyone work night shift? Struggling with a routine in regards to eating and exercise,6,sx01ff,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sx01ff/anyone_work_night_shift_struggling_with_a_routine/,2,"Hey folks, 

I’m someone who’s basically struggled with my weight and eating disorders since I was a child. I was overweight most of my childhood and into middle school, anorexic in high school, and now into adulthood I’ve been dealing with BED for several years, with an increase in the frequency of my binges in the last two years. I know a lot of people have struggled and gained weight the last two years for… the obvious reasons haha, but, I’ve gained about 60lbs since November 2019. 

I’m a 27F (5’7”) and at my lowest I was 122lbs (in HS when anorexic about 15-16yrs/o, and wanted to weigh less— thought I was fat, in hindsight and photos I actually looked sickly), and my current weight is 231lbs. 

I started working a night shift job in October 2021 and ever since then I have not been able to get any sort of routine together and since there’s really nowhere to go at night, I’m binging or just snacking in excess. When I was on a ‘normal’ schedule I had a much easier time regulating my food because I could be busy during the day or just had an easier time tracking “meals” because I had the classic guidelines of breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the ‘normal’ times. Plus, I was up during the day time so could go hiking, walking, running, etc. 

Part of my issues definitely arise from mental illness, something I have a long history of and have been in and out of treatment for, and more recently, a LOT of the issues are stemming from working night shift. I am trying to find a different job but can’t find much paying enough to support myself and I can’t break my lease for cheaper housing. It’s not up til the end of the year. 

Days that I work aren’t so bad because I’ll eat one meal before work, don’t eat at work, and then will MAYBE eat breakfast when I get home; rinse and repeat if I’m working any consecutive days. Days off are where things get really out of control. I’m stuck inside because nothing is open and I don’t want to walk around my neighborhood at night as it is not well lit at all. I’ve considered a gym membership but money is extremely tight for me right now, I’m already in the red every month after just mandatory bills alone. 

I’m also struggling with the concept of a “day” since my “days” span the course of two days. 

This ended up being longer than I intended but just looking for any tips, tricks, or other perspectives from people in a similar situation. Ultimately I know the secret is just to eat less and move more.",1645359363.0

I want to be completely honest with this community and what it looks like to maintain long-term, so here’s where I’ll admit I slightly adjusted my goal range again this past year. It’s taken me all this time to figure out what’s *truly* sustainable for me and that sweet spot seems to be 140-145 lbs (at 5’8”). Currently, I’m right near the top of that range, so I’m working on dropping down just a smidgen, lest my trend launch out of the green zone on TrendWeight (goal is set to 142 ± 2.5): https://trendweight.com/u/957a8d7a65534a/

I have been trying to lose weight for so long now, and really want to come through with doing so this year. Two of my main issues are my sleeping schedule and how many times I eat in a day (along with my poor diet choices…). My sleeping schedule is absolutely horrible. Some days I go to bed at 5 am some days 8 am. Then I wake up around 4 pm or later (unless I have class in the morning). Then sometimes I don’t eat right as I get up, and try not to snack too much at night. However, since I wake up late, I sometimes just eat one meal a day and many snacks. Since starting this journey, and since my sleeping schedule is horrible, I try to limit what I eat and stay within a calorie deficit between the time I wake up to 12:00 am. Pass that, I try to eat small snacks. My question is, does it matter what time I sleep/wake up as long as I’m getting decent sleep? And does it matter what time I eat? I have heard both that our body doesn’t know what time it is and the opposite so I’m confused. I am trying to fix my sleeping schedule but I somehow programmed my body to sleep late.

"I’m An Addict, Right?",13,sws4u0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sws4u0/im_an_addict_right/,4,"I have a history of childhood obesity + anorexia and bulimia. Now I’m a morbidly obese adult that is *always* trying to lose weight. 

I was talking to my cousin tonight who is getting married soon. He’s getting married literally across the globe because it’s where his wife is from, so they’re doing it there. My cousin is incredibly wealthy. Works in tech. Is very young and already making multi six figures. He’s fit. Healthy. Has a gorgeous bride. Gonna buy a home soon and isn’t even thirty yet. He’s seemingly got it made. 

I can’t go to his wedding because of money and covid. And I’m super obese. 311 as of Friday morning, down three from my start of 314 about two months ago. Not much progress. Not super dedicated yet, but trying to at least have more good days than bad. 

So my cousin tells me that one of his very good friends who was supposed to go with him for the wedding relapsed. He’s an addict. Was clean for a few years. Then he relapses about a week ago. And I actually was worried about this. I’m not even friends with his friend. Just know him and like him as his friend and kind of think he’s hot, but I’m five years older so no lol. Also I doubt he’d be into me because I’m SMO. I’m not into me. 

Anyways. My cousin was really upset. Can’t get why he’d relapse so close to a soon to be great trip and time. And I sat there explaining to him that he probably feels very envious of him and inadequate next to him. He’s behind in life from addiction issues and my cousin’s life looks literally perfect. I know that doesn’t mean it is. But his life looks really great. So I can imagine it triggers him, because sometimes it triggers me. I’m also behind in life because I got chronically ill. And I always feel behind because I’ve let myself be held back by my weight most of my life. And he shared some texts with the guys mom with me and pretty much everything I said was on the nose. 

I know I have addiction issues. I use food. To make myself feel better or hurt myself. I was saying all of these things about him and it pretty much was me saying shit about myself. And now I just feel like, I’m an addict, right? And whenever I go over calories and overindulge, I’m pretty much relapsing. Every time I don’t move in the direction to get to a healthy weight. And idk. Should I maybe be in overeaters anonymous? I know I need an eating disorder specialist therapist. But maybe I need more? 

I was going on and on about how this kid needs to be in therapy in NA every week. Needs to control triggers. Needs to be focusing on getting himself healthy so he can make good decisions in life that won’t continue pushing him backwards. But I can say those same exact things about me regarding food. Which is harder to avoid than, say, heroin. 

It just makes me feel stupid that I am so aware and even self aware, yet make bad decisions even still. That is addict behavior. And maybe I need more help than I realize.",1645329401.0

1. Nutrition is King  
2. Strength Training is Queen  
3. Cardio is Prince

Sadly, most people have it backwards. 

They think that running will get them in shape.

Running is excellent for your cardiovascular system, but it will never get you fit if #1 and #2 are not your primary focus.

Cardio is catabolic both to muscle and body fat.

Yes, there is a way to skew that catabolism towards fat cells if you focus more on HIIT.

Strength training, on the other hand, is “pro-tissue”, meaning that it builds muscle, which helps you burn more body fat in the long-run.

In short, drop the long cardio sessions and focus on food and resistance training !

Time passed and I am off my meds now and last time I took olanzapine was almost a year ago. But my weight still didn’t normalize despite eating things that I ate before taking meds. So nothing changed as for my diet but I’m still rather overweight. My guess is that olanzapine fked up my hormones but I might be wrong though.

I started counting my calories and figured out I was only eating a little more than what I should be eating. 

Soon I started noticing how some foods fill you up faster and some take so much time to digest. I had not been paying attention to these things but I should have. 

Please focus and feel what you are eating, know how your body feels after that and how it responds to it. Being fat makes you even more vulnerable to not feeling changes coming about in your body with the food you are putting into it. 

My diet about three months ago used to be one heavy breakfast two full meals three snacks tea twice a day and I would usually treat myself to fried food (I have no count of how many samosas I can eat) , panipuri, dabeli or whatever I was in the mood for. 

Today I have eaten a small breakfast, one third of what I considered a full meal, one tea, one coffee and a good meal in the evening. I feel like I have eaten too much.

Ramadan,5,swsaqa,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swsaqa/ramadan/,3,"
Hello I’m an 18 year old male and have been in a pretty big calorie deficit for about 6 months now. I’m really close to my weight goal and will only continue this diet for about a month or less depending on when I hit my goal. I wanted to do a reverse diet after reaching my goal but I realized that the entire month of April is the Muslim holiday of Ramadan where I can’t eat or drink anything until sundown. I know from research that it is very important to be able to go to the gym and build muscle during a reverse diet but building muscle isn’t a very viable thing to do during Ramadan. I’ll still be going to the gym at least 3 times a week but I was wondering if I should still reverse diet or just go up to a very slight deficit for the month or if I should do something else. If anyone can help me out I’d really appreciate it!",1645329889.0
Back where I started,24,swirxk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swirxk/back_where_i_started/,7,"Today, I reached the weight at which I started more than 2 years ago.

As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/KlV3cLo), I started losing weight in October 2019, and it was going very well! I was studying abroad, doing CICO and walking a lot everyday. Then the pandemic hit, I had to go to my dad's for the lock downs and I was no longer in charge of my food. Without a strict control over my diet, I let everything go, and then 6 months spent at my grandparent's house finishing my degree online (with a lot of very good but very caloric homemade food) certainly didn't help.

But now I am once again living on my own and I have full control over what goes into my body (and my pantry), so even though it felt cliché I decided to try again at the beginning of January as a new year resolution (8kg heavier than when I started more than 2 years ago). Today, I finally reached the weight I was when I started: 118.3kg. I am still morbidly obese, but I am making progress, and I remember how good I felt as I was losing weight the last time, so I am looking forward experiencing that again! I fell off the wagon right before I hit the 100kg mark, so I can't wait to beat past me.

I'll admit that I regret not sticking to it through the pandemic, as I could have reached my goal by now, so this is a little bittersweet, but I'm trying to be happy about my progress anyways! 

I haven't lost a lot (yet), but my method is CICO with a goal of 1400 averaged over the week. I limit myself to lunch and diner to have 2 big and satisfying meals and I try not to snack at all. I try to have 2/3 of vegetables and 1/3 of pasta/rice/potatoes because I've learned that I need my carbs. I haven't told anyone around me that I'm trying to lose weight, so I try to budget for social outings (alcohol, restaurant food). To do this I'll try to be around 1200 cals in the days before/after the outing. 
I'm trying to walk more, but I'm ashamed to say that I've lost muscle during the pandemic (spending 2 years sitting at home will do that I guess). I'd like doing organized sports but I don't think I'm ready to exercise in front of people yet. 

I don't really know why I made this post, but I guess my message is that even if we couldn't reach our goals before, nothing is stopping us from starting again! 
I'll also use this as a reminder to keep trying and counting while I visit my dad for a few days next week, and that even if I do not do as well as usual it's not an excuse to stop when I come back home!",1645301503.0
"I come from a line of addicts, and I'm afraid I'm becoming one too.",17,swkegx,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swkegx/i_come_from_a_line_of_addicts_and_im_afraid_im/,5,"Hi there! I've been a long time lurker and I finally decided to bite the bullet and join. Sorry this will be a really long one since I'm just now realizing how much anxiety I have built up. Also I apologize for any grammatical/spelling errors this may have.

&#x200B;

I (17F) am afraid I'm becoming an addict. On my dad's side of the family from as far as I know, are mostly alcoholics. And sadly I've seen first hand how addiction could destroy a family. A cycle my dad would personally go through normally looked like this:

&#x200B;

He'd go through any problem(s) that causes stress (mainly financial)

Gradually, he'd become more and more irritable and close himself off.

Then, one day he would have a mental breakdown and binge drink for weeks at a time.

Repeat almost yearly.

&#x200B;

Now, what does this have to do with my story? We'll my cycle is almost identical to his. But it became more frequent in the past few years. I'd get stressed, then eat. But now, if I'm happy, I'd eat. If I'm anxious, I'd eat. Even when I'm bored, or feel nothing at all, I'd eat. But, this didn't really hit me until about 6 months ago, during one of my dad's binges, he came in the house soaking wet from sitting outside literally all day in the pouring rain and so drunk he could barely speak. He slipped and fell onto the dining room floor right in front of the doorway. I heard the impact and rushed over. When I went to him from the living room, he was rocking himself slowly to try and stand. He couldn't.

I feel so guilty for what I felt in that moment. I wasn't worried about my recently collapsed and helpless father, I was petrified I saw myself.

Chronically depressed

500 pounds

Collapsed

Soaking wet

and Alone

I realized I got a habit of eating literally anything that comes into the house. If I see a sweet pastry, can of pop, or bag of chips sitting around, I'd indulge. I would feel wayyy less ashamed of this if I enjoyed these treats in reasonable quantity, but that's not the reality. That pastry would turn to 3 in about 15 minutes.

The only thing that has limited my binging is my financial situation, I rarely have money to buy access food for myself so the only snacks available to me are those that my parents buy. I also have to be mindful I leave enough for my two siblings which has indirectly taught me a bit of discipline. But, this is also a great disadvantage. My family is relatively poor and both of my parents are bigger. So fast food or store bought sweets with homecooked meals are what meals look like a lot of the time and I don't have much of an option to eat otherwise.  But everyday I worry I've made food my enemy, or more so, I'm afraid of it. If I start to indulge I won't stop and that terrifies me. 

&#x200B;

I'll end this painfully long rant with some small wins: 

I got a therapist. She's helping me a lot with finding healthy coping mechanisms for my stress. And my mental health has been improving slowly but surely. 

I stopped trying to lose weight for my appearance. For me, this is always guaranteed to fail. Instead I'm trying to improve my relationship with food, and incorporate exercise. The number on the scale will come last. 

I'm going back to my active hobby of dancing. It's something I love to do and a fun way for me to exercise

Since around August, I've been mostly drinking water instead of sugary drinks. Though I have slipped up, I now can't leave the house without my 64 oz water bottle practically attached to my hip. 

I've lost my first 9 pounds since my heaviest at 280 lbs or 127 kg. (I'm 5'8/172 cm) 

&#x200B;

I want to say thank you for reading. I might be posting similar rants and progress when I get more comfortable. Some advice would mean so much to me. I also want to say that my dad isn't a bad person, and he loves me and my family as much as we love him. And just like me, he's trying to improve himself little by little. Again, thank you for reading.

A bit of context: I've been watching my intake for a while and eating healthier and it's been going okay. There's one problem though: Since I'm a student (single & estranged from my family), I spend a lot of time alone in my room, studying. And what I found is that, no matter what activity I set out to do (studying, reading...), all I really want to do is eat. It feels like to me, there's nothing that is just as rewarding as eating. It doesn't even have to be hyper-palatable food - just eating in general feels nice. Maybe I'm just bored, but it really often is difficult to concentrate on anything else apart from the next time I'll get to eat.

So, in order to deal with this issue, I'd like to ask you (if you're also someone who has experience with this): What do you do for fun/pleasure instead of eating (when you're not hungry)? Is there anything in your life that can give you a pleasant feeling like food does? Just how do you cope with this?

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 19, 2022",15,sw7ksm,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sw7ksm/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_19_2022/,0,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to read my post, I appreciate it! Some info on me, I'm 6ft2 and currently weigh just shy of 26stone. I've struggled with eating habits, anxiety, depression and an array of other disorders for my entire life. I've recently separated from my wife and partner of 5 years and have decided to make a good start at bettering myself for myself and my daughter, so I can be a better father and healthier person going forward.

In the past few weeks, I have stopped eating fast food, sugary drinks and other calorific snacks/junk. I ordered an exercise bike which arrived on February 9th and I have ridden at a reasonably high resistance, at 20kmph for an hour a day, every day since the bike arrived (roughly 12 miles a day at 12mph). I've been eating enough to feel full each day but am ending days with between a 2000 and 3500 calorie deficit, I'm aware this isn't going to be constant and as my weight goes down my daily allowance will reduce, I'll burn fewer calories doing the exercise I'm currently.

I'm using MyFitnessPal premium, recording all of my calories, weighing and measuring things. I'm recording my exercise with a combination of a Huawei Band 6, Huawei health, Google Fit and referencing the MFP forums to determine the relevant exercises (such as Stationary Bike Light effort) my resting heartrate is anything from 65-72 and according to my Band I'm at around 120bpm when pedalling at 22kmph on the bike, which is firmly within Fat-burn zone for my build. 

I'm just curious if there is anything else I can be doing? Is there anything I'm missing or doing wrong? Is there any advice for a total newbie to weight management? 

I weighed before I started riding on the first day the bike arrived and weighed a week later and was down 9 pounds (4KG) but I know a lot of that is water weight.

Thanks again for reading!",1645291212.0

It wasn't restrictive nor a fad diet, it was a macro diet, I learnt how to eat hand in hand with a professional, but I got used to lose weight, not gaining it.

I had been on a stable weight of 125lb for almost 9 years, until the pandemic hit and I gained a ton of wight for my height, I reached to 138lb, the highest I have been in YEARS and I couldn't bear to see my body or to see photos of me.

So I decided to start exercising, and in October I reached a professional to help me meet my goal, he is a professional trainer and sports nutritionist, for the first time I understood how %fat works.

I workout 5 days a week, my workout routine is basically 45min to 1hour weights + 30min cardio and I really enjoy it.

Yesterday I went to my revision, I go once a month, he uses an inbody to analyze the progress, and I do not weight myself through the week nor weekly, because I know that muscle weights more than fat, but yesterday when he gave me my results.... I gained almost 2 pounds, they were 2 pounds of muscle, I'll give you that, but I only lost 1 pound of fat. In past months I maintained my weight but it was because the same weight I lose in fat I was gaining in muscle.

My current weight is 128lb, and I look way leaner than before and people at work who see me have said that I look thiner, but still fucks my mind that I gained weight, it's quite hard for me to explain to my friends how it makes me feel, because it seems like I'm bragging when in reality all this years that have passed when I have been maintaining a healthy weight I'm still afraid to be obese once again.",1645291041.0

I eat 1263 cals 6 days a week and on the weekend I eat a meal (mostly pizza or mcdonalds) when i go out or for a takeaway and go over this by 1000. Before anyone tells me this is bad or whatever, I enjoy this and is the only way I stay on track. I've tried other ways before 2 years before this and they don't work for me.

Oh by the way my maintenance is 2063 cals.

Anyway, am I messing up my calorie deficit by doing this? (weekly). Or will I lose my 1lb a week fat still? Thanks!!

I dont know if my math is correct but I should be on track to lose 1lb still? 800 under maintenance 6 days a week=4800-1000=3800. 3500 needed to lose 1lb a fat so well on target for me. But feel free to correct me if my math is super wrong lol",1645309372.0

I had diceded to take 3 days off exercise and come back on the 4 day but doing only 45 min or 1 hour.
I was thinking this happen because i slept to little that day but my friends tell me that this happen because i push my body to hard while being overweight and i can demage my heart doing this lenghty vigorous exercise overtime.
What is your guys opinion should i reduce the lenght of my exercise or should i reduce the intensity or maybe i just take more off days per week?
Or maybe it happen because my lack of sleep and i shouldt change nothing?

Baby Steps & Small Victories,26,svzvg0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svzvg0/baby_steps_small_victories/,8,"I recently posted about my addiction to food delivery.

Sunday I ordered a milkshake and fries to work. Monday morning I signed into my DoorDash account from my laptop and changed the password to some auto-generated string of random letters and numbers and uninstalled the app from my phone. In case that wasn't enough I made it so that I cannot install any apps without my password which I do not know as I just use FaceID for everything.

I haven't ordered anything all week. Five days, though to be fair I only worked Wednesday and Thursday. It's still something.

Aside from that I have also cooked myself at least dinner every day this week. I went to the grocery store on Tuesday to restock a few things, decided to get everything I needed to make stir-fry. That's a lot of produce for just one person, so I ended up making stir-fry a few nights and fajitas one night since I had everything to do that as well. It's all been delicious, I can't remember when I last made stir-fry.

I am using up all or at least nearly all of the produce I am buying, and I feel really good about that. I often times in the past bought a lot of good food with the intention of making all sorts of meals for myself only for it to go bad and get tossed. I feel a lot of guilt wasting food.

I am making a serious effort to up my water intake. I keep a giant cup of water with me all times when I'm home and my water bottle when I'm working.

Lastly, I started logging my intake again, weighing everything to ensure accuracy. I don't have a caloric goal in mind as of now, I'm more just trying to get a sense of how much I am eating every day. I am not trying to lose weight right now. I'd be happy to maintain my current weight (135-140) until winter is over when I'm able to be more active again.

I know it's only been a short time, but I figured maybe throwing all of this into the void may give me more motivation to hold myself accountable.

I've been a longtime lurker and I just created an account to post on here. You all seem like a supportive bunch and so I'm encouraged to finally post my own issue :)

Do any yo-yo dieters suffer from major diet fatigue when faced with the fact that they'll have to go through the process all over again?

I know what to do but mentally it's really hard to start again. I know my tdee, I know how many calories to put into my mouth, but I don't start again because the idea of counting and measuring and turning obsessive is really painful. I know that being obsessive is not a requirement to lose weight, but it's always been my experience. 

The fact that I've gone up and down 40 pounds four times in the span of 15 years has been hard on my body and harder on me mentally. (for reference I am 5'3 female with a small frame in my 30s, weight ranged from 90s to 130s). 

I'm so discouraged and disappointed in myself that I'm trying to lose weight for a 5th time.

I'm now at the high end of the range and wish to lose 20 pounds. But every Monday for the past 3 years I've been starting over again. It's painful. But I can't seem to diet the way I used to. I have too much evidence that it isn't long lasting the way I was doing it and I give up easily.

If anyone has any advice or just want to share their experience, I'd be grateful. I feel very alone.

February has not been my month,1,swiqs8,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swiqs8/february_has_not_been_my_month/,1,"I’ve had a very unsuccessful month of dieting, lately, and I feel ashamed and frustrated with my circumstances.

Some of you may remember that a few things keep me from controlling what types of food that I have access to: ​​[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sna1bs/i\_have\_more\_obstacles\_than\_i\_realized/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sna1bs/i_have_more_obstacles_than_i_realized/)

I did really well in January, but in early February, when I ran low on healthy food, my mom told me that we don’t have enough money to restock. I tried to stick to my calorie counting method and just try to eat the junk food that was left in small enough portions to keep my calorie deficit.

Just as I was getting the hang of that, my period came two weeks early. I have a history of excessive bleeding, so my attempts at continuing my workout routine usually either ended in stained clothes/floors, puking, or nearly passing out from a dizzy spell. Towards the end, I suffered severe sinus pain, which made me even more dizzy: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/sn9kz3/whats\_going\_on\_with\_my\_sinuses/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/sn9kz3/whats_going_on_with_my_sinuses/) . At this point, I had to sit in a chair and lean my forehead against the fridge if I wanted to cook a bowl of oatmeal because the room wouldn’t stop spinning.

Now remember what I said about my mom saying that we didn’t have enough money to buy more healthy food? Well, my mom is also a bit of a compulsive buyer and admits that she likes grocery shopping a little too much. So she went out to get ten frozen pizzas that were on sale, but got sidetracked, and bought a whole bunch of junk food and soda. She also makes sure to get liquor and cigarettes every day, which really adds up. I finally started to get irritated this week when she made barbecue ribs, fried chicken, spaghetti with bacon grease, and broccoli cooked in butter with bacon bits. I’ve also tried to stop her from going out to restaurants/getting takeout three times (once for each meal). She also kept pushing me to get a cake or other treat from the store despite knowing that I’ve been dieting (and on the verge of sh!tting myself in the store because of my period).

I know that as a grown adult, I shouldn’t have to rely on my mom for food, but when I’m unemployed and she’s throwing away all this money to junk food without me even knowing, it’s difficult. It’s also disappointing to know that she’s aware that I’m dieting because I’m obese, has told me to lose weight, and has announced that she’ll be dieting, too, but continues with this behavior. I had a feeling that jumping on this diet with me would be hard for her when she drove through snow to buy liquor instead of drinking the water in her car, and when she got a headache from not eating all day because “fruit and oatmeal isn’t real food” and chose to wait 30+ minutes in pain and make me cook tacos for her.",1645301418.0
Changes I've noticed in just 5 days of getting healthier!,92,svpb7r,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svpb7r/changes_ive_noticed_in_just_5_days_of_getting/,17,"Started working out and eating fairly healthy on Monday and loving it but my motivation is starting to fade a bit so I thought I'd post a list of benefits I've noticed already to encourage me and anyone else!


1. Skin feels so soft! I think it's from sweating out the impurities and immediately washing them away and moisturising. Also think my tattoos look more vivid!
2. Sinuses are way clearer. Not sure why but my sinuses have felt really stuffy for ages and I wasn't really able to breathe in deeply through my nose. Now I have no problem.
3. Mental health is much improved. Even though I can probably only do like 65% of the workout (i'm doing Chloe Ting), I'm so proud of myself for putting in the effort and I feel like frickin Wonder Woman for the rest of the day. This has also helped me to be more productive - my flat is clean and tidy, I'm taking care of my skin and hair, and brushing and flossing my teeth consistently (might not sound hard but, when you're dealing with some depression, stuff like that can feel impossible)
4. I feel fitter already! I live in a city with a lot of uphill walking and I used to sometimes have to stop to catch my breath. Today I walked four and a half miles around town with lots of uphill and it was no bother!

I think all this in just 5 days is really great so, if you're looking to get healthier, go for it! We can do it!


EDIT: When I say sweating out impurities, I just mean that I think sweating is good for your skin (like there's salt in sweat and salt is cleansing). Obviously I don't believe that we need to rid our bodies of toxins manually, that's what your liver is for.",1645210106.0

I recently decided to join a gym to help concur my weight loss. I currently tip the scales at 360lbs ( not my heaviest weight) and I’m genuinely really nervous about going to the gym. I suffer with anxiety and have done for most of my life. 

I did go to the gym a few years back when I wasn’t as heavy and I enjoyed going. I got into a little routine and it was great but now the thought of me going makes me feel sick. 

Maybe I’m worried in case people point and laugh at me or I break some of the equipment I don’t know what it is anyway maybe I need to be told to man up. I’m going to try and go tonight.

For a whole month, I’ve been researching what I can do at the gym and I’m absolutely overwhelmed with the amount of information and I have no idea where to start. 

All this while I thought I’d be scared to go to the gym because I’m absolutely afraid of being judged but today I realized no one gives a shit about what you do in the gym. That makes me want to go to the gym more. But I have no clue what exactly I’m supposed to do. I thought of getting myself a personal trainer but DAMN it’s expensive. 

What should I do?",1645249506.0

It has taken me almost 10 years of gaining/losing to figure this out!! I used to think I was doomed because I always thought you can’t maintain a deficit (true) but once you start eating normally then you’ll just automatically gain it all back (which is also true if you don’t change habits while in the deficit). I used to think I was just dealt bad genetics, I was the fat kid all my life. But when I really think about it, I was not active as a kid and ate way too much. Ultimately it’s calories in/calories out, I do believe food quality matters too however I gained weight eating the most high  quality nutrient dense food because I was eating too many calories for my expenditure. Science lol. I feel dumb it took me this long to realize. Now I want to focus on building muscle and changing body composition while in a very minimum surplus like 100 calories over a day until I’m satisfied with the muscle I’ve built and then go back to maintaining. And I realize how freaking EASY it is to overeat especially garbage food! And how you really cannot exercise it off, it would take hours everyday to do that. I get it now.

I'm new...sharing my journey so far!,16,svzeg0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svzeg0/im_newsharing_my_journey_so_far/,4,"Hello! I'm very new to using reddit so I'm sorry of I do this wrong...but I'm excited to find a thread of people who are also looking to make a lifestyle change! Moderators if this post lacks enough advice to be here I will remove it right away, apologies! I'm still trying to figure this place out lol!

My story: I'm 38, and I've been big my whole life, but I became truly morbidly obese in the last 10 years or so. I'm ashamed to admit I was sucked into the HAES movement for awhile, and in that time I let myself get up to 376lbs. I was not doing well: My blood pressure, previously perfect, was starting to climb; I was walking with a cane; I was on daily opioid medication for my back pain (I have a congenital spine defect but it was manageable before I got so big). I was not doing well, but I was also so sucked into fatlogic that I couldn't see a way out.

Then in March 2020 I was laid off. Briefly. I was immediately hired back into a different position in the company, but that one day was really rough, and my dad drove out to go for a walk with me to help me take my mind off things. That first day was painful and slow. In about 45 minutes, I walked 0.6 miles with the help of a cane, and dad asked if I wanted to walk again tomorrow.

Walking with him became a habit, and after a few months I realized I'd begun to lose weight. I dropped about 30lbs just from walking and realized I was feeling better! My blood pressure was lower, my back didn't hurt as bad, and I just generally had more energy.

It would be another year, though, before I realized that my eating habits were going to catch back up with me once my body got used to being more active. When I stepped on a scale in May of 2021 and realized I'd gained back 10 of my lost pounds, I decided to start counting calories and working on eating better, too.

Cut to today: I've been counting calories, cutting way back on fast food/processed food, learning to cook and doing meal prep, and as a result I've now lost 90lbs! I'm close to the halfway point of the total 206 I want to lose (170lbs is my goal weight, since I'm 5'10""). I've gone from size 32 pants to size 24/26 (brand dependent there lol), and today I bought a size 16/18 tank top that fits perfectly! My blood pressure is good again, I'm on a much lighter medication for my back condition, and I've ditched the cane completely. Oh, and I'm walking 4-5 times a week, averaging 3-4 miles per walk, average speed now about 23 minutes per mile. Plus I have more energy than I know what to do with some days!!!

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story in hopes of finding others who have been through this journey or are maybe on it right now, so we can share our successes and stumbles, and learn from each other's mistakes. I hope this is the right place and way to do this. Thank you if you read this far!

Biggest tip: If I've learned anything so far, it's that moderation is really the key. There is no such thing as a diet you can just 'quit' once you get to your goal, because your body WILL jump at the opportunity to put the pounds back on! So making small, sustainable changes that you can live with--and live with for the rest of your life--are far more important than making BIG changes that you'll abandon in a week or a month or a year. It's not about perfect, it's about progress!

TL;DR: I'm a former HAES/FA member who saw the light and am down 90 pounds out of the 206 I need to lose, just looking for support and community as I continue on my journey!",1645238391.0
From nearly 3000 cals to 1200.. please help (I’m the hangry type lol),0,swe483,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/swe483/from_nearly_3000_cals_to_1200_please_help_im_the/,8,"TLDR at bottom.

Weight story: 
I am 5’2, 24y/o, F.
Last year I was at my lowest weight, 92lbs, I had become so boney I was crying all the time. I then started taking my health more seriously and started eating more and more to gain the weight. My weight loss was due to simply not eating enough. I was vegan then, now I’m just dairy free, though to gain weight I did allow more dairy just bc it was a lot of cals and had protein and wasn’t super filling. In the beginning I had to train my appetite by eating calorie dense foods for a few months before I could eat normally. I hit my first goal weight (113lbs) and decided I wanted to get to 120lbs as that was when I was happiest before when I was on my first fitness journey (I had reached 141lbs at the heaviest and was not working out at all back then). So I got to my goal weight of 120lbs and decided to start doing recomp so I could lose fat from my (slightly dirty) bulk while also gaining muscle. However, I have just been gaining weight and am now at 131lbs… and I’m freaking out, as that’s only 10lbs away from my heaviest. I try to workout 3/4 days a week but this past month I have only been working out 1/2 days due to winter depression and lack of motivation.

TLDR:
So now I’m struggling to go from trying to gain weight to wanting to lose it, as my appetite is now HUGE from eating nearly 3000 cals daily. MFP is telling me to eat only 1200 cals to lose 2lbs/wk. 

I just hate feeling hungry all the time and don’t know how to handle the drastic change in cals.",1645288869.0

The mental mosquito that is your calorie count,8,sw399t,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sw399t/the_mental_mosquito_that_is_your_calorie_count/,7,"10PM on a Friday night. Chose to stay in and get some work done instead of hitting the bar. A feeling overwhelmed my body, ""it's time to eat something."" My mind of course says, ""oh no, I shouldn't."" Brain quickly brings up that I have 800 ""unspent"" calories, that I should ""use it or lose it."" My conscious mind tried to fight back, that we just had some mints, we're not even feeling hungry at all. But I knew my brain won, as I was already mid-walk to the fridge, doing mental calorie math to figure out what I can eat and still remain within my daily limit.

Sure, I'm still within my daily calorie goals, but I felt defeated. Because next time I get this urge, I probably won't have those 800 calories to spare at night. And my brain will just use a different type of pattern interrupt to short circuit any logic that I have prepared for such situations.

For me, these situations are my primary struggle. Meal prepping, shopping, cooking, picking appropriate ingredients to meet macros, those are all pretty easy, clinical things that you can learn on the internet in a few hours once. But fighting internal self-sabotage from within is something I don't know how to tackle or where to even start seeking out information on how to tackle it. 

Can anyone direct me to some resources (like books or courses) that can help me improve my mindset and patterns of thinking around eating?",1645251445.0
Is it unhealthy/ineffective to save 1000+ calories for night time?,13,svxcsy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svxcsy/is_it_unhealthyineffective_to_save_1000_calories/,13,"Hi all,

I (28NB, 360 lbs) have to lose 100 pounds to get top surgery so I'm trying to lose weight through Noom, since I already had an account. I've had a history of ED so it's sort of a slippery slope for me, but I've set my progress to losing 1lb a week and that's made me feel less crazy than when my calorie cap was at 1400. Now it's at around 2000.

I'm on Adderall, so after I have my morning latte, some small breakfast, and my meds I'm not hungry until the evening. Plus, I'm usually too busy at work to eat. I did IF before and liked it well enough, but I like to make myself oat milk lattes in the morning so IF doesn't really fit with that and if I get to 6pm without eating something I do tend to feel a little murderous, so hence the small breakfast and occasional protein snacks. By 6pm I've usually had 400-500 calories, leaving 1500.

I've heard all sorts of things about how it's bad to eat at night, and also that your body can go into starvation mode by slowing metabolism, but I've also heard people say these things are myths so, I'm wondering: Other calorie savers - did you still lose weight? Did it feel sustainable? What is your experience?

I am currently counting calories and try to lose some weight again (i lost 25 kg in 2014, but have slowly gained 15 of them back). I am working out 3 times a week, and are eating healthy. For most days this works like a wonder, and I keep under my calorie goal.

But, in my work I have a lot of meetings with customers. In the evening it is normal to invite do dinner and some beers. So on average once a week I eat out and drink. Those days I go way over my calorie goals.
To make it worse, when I am hung over the day after I have trouble sticking to the diet and often eat to much.

So like, 5 days in the negative and 1-2 days I go over results in maintaining my weight. And it sucks!

The next two years were the best, I was eating mindfully, wasn't restricting myself at all, and kept a very healthy weight both on the scale and in terms of how I felt in my body and also my relationship with food was entirely healed - which was the most important thing. Yes, I still had some insecurities but really loved myself. However, after 3 years I went to work abroad and gained weight. I came back and lost it. Then I went to work again, this time it was a lot more stressful, at the same time I had troubles with the university, then gained the weight back. Came back home, took a break from everything, lost weight again, started working out again and eating well, and I started feeling okay with my body. In the process, I stopped looking at how I look outside and focused more internally, started doing yoga which helped, and stopped forcing myself to work out so hard but instead was more gentle with my body. At the same time, I was finishing with uni, started work and applied for a master's, and got back to my emotional eating habits. I gained the weight back. It's been almost a year since then, and I still haven't lost the gained weight. In the meantime, I started doing more endurance because I got tired of the weight training. It's helping me mentally but I still feel like I look awful. At this point, I feel like I ruined my body. This was all in the range of 10kg which for some may not be a big deal and I know I should be grateful that I still have the chance to change but I am so tired. I am scared that with every life change I will gain weight and then take months for me to lose it again. It is just taking so much out of my life force, and time.

I am losing hope that I will ever get back to that same place I once was. Both mentally and physically.

I used to have my dad to drag me out of the house even when I didnt want to go. sadly he abandoned his exercise routine and now I don’t have anyone banging on the door to get me out to go do my weight training and stuff lol

I’m setting a goal to go on my next day off since they still have weird rona hours and I can’t go after work tomorrow. I’m going to use one of their new ellipticals and try to stop hating it so much.

I need to also train myself to start getting out of bed earlier, instead of only getting up to get ready for work, and having a full day. Wake up, gym, breakfast, enjoy the morning, go to work at noon, have hobby hours, bed, rinse and repeat. Depression is kicking my ass but I’ll get there eventually:)",1645248255.0
You can do it!,9,svrgwg,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svrgwg/you_can_do_it/,4,"You really can do it. I know some of you need to hear this! I started my weight loss journey on April 20th, 2021 and I am closing in on my 1-year mark. I started at 205 - 31% body fat and right now am 177 - 20% body fat.

**Why?** This is the most important thing about a journey. If you don't have a strong enough reason why you are doing something it will not last and you will look for shortcuts. My why is because I know I can and I want to prove it to myself every single day. I do not care what other people think or care for positive or negative feedback. This is for me and what I think of myself. By proving this to myself every day I can achieve happiness every day even if my goal is a long time away.

**How?** This is the second most important thing about your journey. You need to be at least 80-90% consistent with whatever you find out works for you on a weekly basis. It should take forever to do this depending on how far away from your goal you are. Don't try to go lose more than 1 pound per week, 4 pounds per month, 52 pounds per year maximum( I am probably only going to lose 30 pounds in a year and went many weeks without losing weight ). I am going to tell you that you need to exercise, eat right, and recover(sleep well) but not how to do each of those. Find what is best for you in those 3 categories and be consistent.

**Balance** Listen, eating the right food, getting in the right exercises for the right amount of time, and getting enough sleep is very time-consuming on a daily basis. The journey is going to be very long and you need to be extremely consistent. The only way to do this is to enjoy every minute of it. If you would only be happy with your end goal and can't enjoy the steps on the way there you will suffer(even if the scale or mirror doesn't show progress). If you suffer you will avoid doing what is necessary and look for shortcuts or stop. Or even worse, you will regress to be beginning of your journey or go further in the wrong direction and this will make enjoying what you do 10 times harder which leads to suffering. Find the right balance that makes you consistent on a weekly basis.

Your body takes care of you every day and you need to take care of it. You only get 1.

This took a lot of courage but here I am. In fact, this is the only place I can share all of this because in the environment I grew up in, everyone else thinks I'm either an ungrateful bish who is inconsiderate of others who don't have enough food in their table or someone who's just ""too young"" to even think about losing weight. 

Back in 2013, I started to gain weight because of unhealthy eating habits and I was made fun of because of it. It really affected my self esteem and got depressed. Since then, all I think about is losing weight. And finally in 2020, I decided to start my weight loss journey with IF and CICO. Which I got in trouble for because in my family, losing weight - specifically fasting or ""not eating enough"" was equivalent to getting a trip to the hospital. My mother once said to me that - the ""fatter"" you are the more healthier"" you'll be. I stopped working out because it's so uncomfortable and stressful when my family is around all the time. Plus, I get so busy with college. I remember just breaking down in the bathroom for not being able to follow the workout routine. So I gave up.

It was gaining 22 lbs. more after and seeing ""overweight"" in my BMI that made me decide to start again this year. This time - no turning back. Being able to wear my old clothes again mattered more than their opinions. My goal weight is to be at least 93 lbs. which isn't too small for my height. 

Now, I'm only doing IF and CICO. So far, I lost 7 lbs. which is such a great achievement for me. But sometimes I do get guilty because what if I do end up in the hospital... 

If you're still reading up to this lengthy point thank you! Any tips and advice is highly appreciated. We can definitely reach our own goals one day at a time.",1645245173.0

I’m still experiencing rapid weight loss since surgery. I’ll take the weight loss in general, as I was at 324 at my highest.

I havent lost any weight on the scale but it hasnt gone up a lot either so I assume I am replacing with muscle.

I counter this by not including exercise calories burned in my daily total, but allowing myself a 100-200 calories snack per hour of moderate or higher exercise.

I'm finally letting go of a goal date,93,sv84p1,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv84p1/im_finally_letting_go_of_a_goal_date/,16,"It's one of those things that everybody tells you to do, but I'm finally doing it. I'm going to focus on changing my behaviors without a timeline.

It's always something: I need to look the way I want to look by summer, by a certain event, for a certain trip, by the time I see certain people. Despite every instance of 'it's not a race' I read or hear, I kept putting all this pressure on myself to reach a specific weight by a specific date. Even though this has literally never gone according to plan, I've been giving myself these timelines for years and years.

It has never helped, only harmed. Since I always based my goal calculations on the assumption that every single day I would eat the exact right number of calories, every time I went over by a bit too much, it felt like an enormous deviation from the plan that sets the entire thing off track. Eating 2,000 calories over your target calories over an indulgent weekend feels like a huge deal if you only have a few weeks to meet a weight deadline. Suddenly that entire week feels wasted and you only had so much time to begin with.

So an indulgent weekend turns into days of binging, because it feels like this failure is inevitable. And if I can't trust myself to stick to the 'good' number of calories, then I might as well go all out on the 'bad' number of calories (objectively I know that there's a difference between going 200 over and 2,000 over, but it doesn't feel that way on the day).

Writing this out feels insane. But being in a body I'm not happy with is anxiety-inducing. I want so badly to get back to a point where I'm comfortable again, but anticipating setbacks - feeling like the goal is forever out-of-reach - makes me want to engage in the behavior that causes those setbacks in the first place.

I think that seeing this as an open-ended health journey will be helpful in allowing 'imperfect' days to be minor slow-downs or bumps in the road rather than a big enough deal to completely ruin my time-constrained plan.

Has anyone else had to learn to make that transition? To let go of their attempts at planning and *actually* listen to the wiser folk who kept emphasizing the importance of being patient?

Would like advice on where to go now,3,svtltr,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svtltr/would_like_advice_on_where_to_go_now/,2,"Hi, I'm a 5'11 16 year old male at around 176.2 pounds and this is my first time posting on this subreddit. I decided to post something because I wanted some advice on what to do to continue with my exercise, weight watching, food, etc. I hope this is the right place.

I have been doing 10,000 step walks (about 4.5-5 miles) 5 days a week for the past 2 years or so. I started originally when I was approaching 200 pounds because I was stressing out about where I was and was not happy. I got a fitbit which I've been using daily since and in about 5 months or so I went from around 199 to 160. I have always been the type of person to enjoy eating food and it helps my mood but at the same time that means I've also struggled with always being able to have perfect self control. Since reaching the original goal of 160 my weight has slowly gone up to 172.6 and I have been eating more than I feel like I should (I have not been keeping track but it's probably close to about 3000-3200 calories a day on average). I just wanted some advice on if it would be the right idea to try to go back down to around 160-165 again and just what the best weight range and calorie count I should be aiming for. I just want to know if it would make sense to change anything/lose more weight or if I'm fine with what I'm currently doing and the average calorie count I currently have. If it is important the main thing that is causing me concern is mainly that for the most part I'm pretty thin and have thin arms and such but most of my extra weight goes to my stomach area (a family thing) and so if there is something specific for that that I should be doing instead that would be greatly appreciated. 

Sorry if this is the wrong space for this, didn't know exactly where to ask this. If you are reading this, thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.",1645221487.0

I’ve struggled with being overweight and eating poorly since I was a child. I’ve always been the largest in my class, friend group etc. I’m tall (5’10) and have always been overweight. In 2017, I was depressed and gained a lot of weight - at my highest weight I was about 220 pounds. However, a year later (2018), I lost about 40 pounds without much effort. I ate a bit better, but my diet was still pretty bad, though I did walk a lot. 

From June 2019 to June 2021, I was very depressed and coped with food (just like 2017). I gained 40 pounds in 2 years, and am now the heaviest I’ve ever been at 230 pounds. It’s affected my health and my doctor has told me I need to lose at least 10% of my bodyweight. 

For the past 3 months, I’ve been tracking everything I eat through the Lose It app. Originally I had it set to 1800 calories, but I wasn’t losing anything, so a month ago I set my activity to “sedentary” (which is accurate anyways) and I now aim to eat about 1500-1600 calories a day. But I’m still not losing weight. I’ve lost a few inches off of my chest and waist (assuming I measured correctly) but my weight hasn’t budged, and I look the exact same in my “progress” photos from January and now. I’m getting super discouraged, and have already gone way over my calorie limit this week. I’m eating so much less than I used to (when I was gaining weight), plus I’ve cut out or reduced other things (less sugar in my coffee, no Starbucks, way less snacking and frozen food) but I’m not seeing any results. It’s frustrating too because a few years ago, I seemed to lose weight without changing much, but now I’m trying so hard and getting no results. 

I also like spinning as a workout, but it doesn’t seem to be contributing at all to my weight loss. I’ve read that weightlifting is better for fat loss - does it have to be heavy weights at the gym? Or can it be body weight workouts, or dumbbell workouts? 

Hoping for some advice/encouragement. Has anyone else been in this situation, and if so, what helped you? Is it worth getting a Registered Dietician, or will they just tell me standard advice (eat less, eat better and workout more)?

Is this deficit too steep?,3,svq00q,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svq00q/is_this_deficit_too_steep/,14,"Hello.  Currently 323 pounds, looking to get to around 210. 

Current intake is 1750 cals. With a macro breakdown of 40% protein, 30% carbs & fat. 

I’m not very active at all. Plan is to lose approximately 20% of my bodyweight through restrictive diet. Than as activity can ramp up, gradually increase calories to match. 

Would love some feedback from the community on this plan, especially those who have lost 100+. 

Thanks!",1645211902.0
Could use some advice,3,svpp0i,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svpp0i/could_use_some_advice/,1,"I currently weigh around 180 at 5’5 (female). I have a history of restrictive eating which morphed into binge eating and over eating. At the beginning of the pandemic I was 170, walking a ton and counting calories and lost 15 lb to 155and i was proud but not in a very good spot mentally. I got pregnant August 2020 and gained about 4plb up to around 200lb. 

I’ve been trying to lose weight and find good habits but I feel like I already eat pretty well, which is frustrating. I rarely eat bread, mostly fruits and veggies and low fat Greek yogurt, chicken tacos for dinner (thigh, with onion and garlic and no sour cream etc). I live in New England so it is hard to get exercise in the winter.

I got too obsessive with calories recently and I was exercising a minimum of 2 hours 6 days a week, then I relapsed and had a binge.

I stopped counting calories after that binge (about 2 weeks ago) and felt like I was in a really good spot mentally, feeling good about my body, when I found out I gained like 7 lb in the last two weeks. I’ve been trying intuitive/mindful eating but now I’m just sad and frustrated. I’m already in therapy, and I have an appointment with a local weight loss clinic i used to attend.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated :/ I just feel like I have to torture myself mentally (ie count calories) in order to make myself lose weight, and I’m not sure what to do.",1645211100.0

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 18, 2022",15,svfaae,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svfaae/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_18_2022/,4,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

Resources for Holistic-Oriented Weight Loss,1,svwtl9,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svwtl9/resources_for_holisticoriented_weight_loss/,2,"Hi, I'm somebody who yo-yos alot. I've been working on myself a ton the past two years but one of the things I haven't focused much on is my weight/size/body image. 

Right now I'm 205lbs, which is close to the highest peak in my weight fluctuations. At times I'll go from 220-154 within 6 months or so but then I'll gain and lose, gain and lose. I've realized that part of my yo-yoing and bad habits surrounding food involve dissociating. I often don't feel hunger cues and I often snack mindlessly. I also have a habit of making or ordering X amount of food and feeling like I have to eat it all in one sitting.

Lately I've been noticing when I'm getting the feelings of ""I want to snack on something""and substituting it with drinking water to see if the craving goes away. I'm ordering smaller portions and generally being more aware of how much I'm eating. I'll sit down for a meal with my family and tell myself ""I'm going to eat x amount then wait 20 minutes to see how I feel."" Since this shift I haven't felt those ""over full"" feelings as often and I don't feel like beating myself up if I do get the over full feelings.

Part of my problem is I know this is the right direction for me but I want to learn more about these sort of ideas. And I want to hear from experts. Is anybody else following a similar ""listen to your body"" path? Are there any books, blogs, or podcasts that have a similar focus?",1645230570.0

I started at 300, I told my friends 290, because it was for some reason too devastating for me to tell them I hit 300lbs.   Since then I would lose weight but offset the number by 10, I am 265 this morning, and the last update I told them was 258, A lot of my coworkers are telling me they can see the difference.   Should I tell them I lied or just wait until I pass the weight I already talked about before bringing it up again.   I am leaning towards the latter.   Feels a bit cheap, but I am losing almost 3lbs a week.

So my diet if anyone wants to know has removed almost all cheese/red meat - How I did this, I started eating Thai, Vietnamese, and I gave up traditional breakfast.

Breakfast - Banana with some PB

Lunch - Salad and a carb or Thai

Dinner - well portioned high protein diet

Snacks - Cottage cheese, or blueberries, or if I am really suffering a peanut butter fold over.

&#x200B;

Calorie intake max 1800 per day (average 1600) - Cheat day Saturday max 2900 calories (I have never hit this)

Exorcise -

Walking 10 miles per week, broken up over 3 walks.

Weight lifting - 2-3 times a week, two are light intensity, one is vigorous.

Saturday cannot be a rest day, usually sunday is.

Edit - I lost 35 lbs, I actually made a typo, I cannot edit the title anymore and I apologize.  My conscious mind glossed over it because it's the same lie I talked about in the post.  I apologize for being misleading.

Strength Training vs. Cardio WITH calorie deficit. Types of results?,3,svngfl,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svngfl/strength_training_vs_cardio_with_calorie_deficit/,6,"Hello.

I'm 34F, 5'7 and currently 147lbs (starting weight 150lbs). My mid-term goal is 130lbs - I have a slim frame and extra weight is fairly noticeable on me, despite my height. I'd probably be happy sticking at 130lbs long-term if I somehow got swole af. (Unlikely, but hey, anything's possible!)

The issue: I work from home, and have since the pandemic, so I lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle, which has led me to put on an extra 10lbs since the beginning of lockdowns. While I do go for walks, my neighborhood isn't super walkable so my immediate surroundings are limited. And I hate, I mean really hate, most forms of exercise. I despise running and going to a gym bores me to tears. I'm best at exercise that doesn't feel like exercise - activities, like hiking, playing tennis, or dance. I do hike with friends occasionally, but they are all fitter than me and will frequently go for challenging hikes that I can't currently hack. My biggest problem, however, is motivation.

I also love food. I've been following a 1200-calorie diet for the past two weeks, and it's been challenging. Food is one of my joys in life and restricting what I can eat, especially dining out... it's not fun. I do tend to drink a lot - wine is a particular weakness - so cutting down on alcohol consumption has been a fairly easy way to cut calories with great health benefits.

I do have a good metabolism, so I feel like if I really put my mind to being more active the weight would come off fairly easily, but motivating myself to step it up has been challenging to say the least. I'm my own worst enemy in that.

Here's the deal - I have a trip to Paris planned in two months, and I'm really hoping my jeans fit again by the time I travel. I'd really like to slim down as much as possible by then, especially so I can eat all the cheese and drink all the wine without guilt (I walk a ton when I travel so I'm not worried about balancing the calories there, plus calories don't count on vacation!). Realistically, I know I can lose about \~1lb/week, which would put me at about 140lbs by the time I go (my pre-pandemic weight).

My question is - what can I do to speed up the weight loss in the two months before my trip, and how can I better motivate myself? Filling recipes for meals under \~400 calories that are heavy on the protein? Things to avoid? This isn't a short-term solution - I'm planning on sticking with it after the trip and continuing to lose until I hit my goal weight, but with a firm deadline on the calendar I'm hoping it'll be easier to stick to a concrete goal.",1645200939.0

This may seem weird in a subreddit where to help each other achieve our weight loss goals, but I seem to be losing weight at a very, very fast pace. I want to stay healthy and I don't want to exhaust my body, hence why I'm seeking advice today.


 I'm a man, 30 years old, my starting weight was 221 lb on Jan. 24th.

This morning, Feb. 18th, I'm at 211.4 lb.

I always weigh myself as soon as I wake up, about once or twice per week. I'm using Myfitnesspal, and I'm at 1650kcal / day. I work a desk job, going to the gym around twice a week, 45 minutes each time.

My macros objectives are around 100g protein/ 55g lipids/ 186g carbs but I usually end up eating more fats than carbs, proportionally.

I am aware that when you embark on a weight loss journey, the first thing you lose is water, but 10lb in barely a month seems big, doesn't it?

Anyways, thanks a lot for your help on this!",1645199009.0

I use the big pot to cook them (probably like 3-4 lbs of potatoes) and add onions, garlic, salt, and pepper to them.  Typically I use about 2 to 2.5 sticks of butter, and this time I used 1 stick and some plain yogurt.  It just doesn't have the same yummyness without all that butter.  My wife and 1 year old still liked them, and they were okay to me, just not as good as usual.  I think my wife thinks I generally use 1 stick of butter for the whole pot, because I told her I used over a stick less and she seemed shocked.

What is your method of losing body fat? strict low carb vs. strict caloric deficit experiment,0,svs3qq,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svs3qq/what_is_your_method_of_losing_body_fat_strict_low/,12,"I’m going to try and make this as short as possible. My fitness/weight loss journey started a little before Covid originally popped up. 

I am 5’8 and at the time 210ish pounds. I saw a picture of myself and didn’t really recognize my face. I was disgusted and upset. 

About 10 months later of strict calorie counting (in a deficit) and a mixture of walking/HIIT exercises and occasional 24 hour fasts I was around 148 pounds but had lost an exceptional amount of muscle. Never counted macros, usually ate what I wanted, on the higher protein side however. 

I started lifting weights and maintained body weight for a few weeks, and then went on a 5-6 month bulk. Got to around 178 pounds. 

I am about 7 weeks in on my cut of practicing a low carb diet. About 30-40 net carbs a day. I’m currently 17lbs losing very slowly but it is trending down. However at this point i don’t care about the scale as much as trying to maintain as much muscle mass as possible and lose body fat muscle. 

I’ve seen where a low carb cut was muscle sparing and I wanted to test out the grounds but I’m not sure I’m seeing the progress as much I want. I haven’t been taken weekly progress pictures so that could be my fault because I see myself in the mirror all the time.

I think I’m just going to back to strict calorie counting and maintain a high protein diet but other than that eat what I want? 

Has anyone else experimented like this? What is your best method of focusing solely on losing body fat and maintaining muscle? I could care less what the actual number on the scale says. My goal is to get to 12% body fat or less by Summertime. And just an FYI i workout 4 times a week lifting weights. Not sure if I said that. Would love to hear others opinions, experiences.

I know I’ve lost about 15 lbs since I was at my heaviest at 275. However, I used to step on the scale several times a day. I once had three scales in the house to see if they each said different things. I based my self worth on a number that varied by the hour and it ate me up on the inside. I felt ugly and unloved, I didn’t want to be touched. Now, I know I’ve still got a long way to go and I know that I’ve still got flaws, but I don’t step on the scale unless I go to the doctor. 

It’s small steps so I don’t get overwhelmed, and it’s things I can do daily so I feel proud I accomplish them and don’t feel like a failure if one small thing doesn’t get done.

If it's a Thursday, I'll weigh myself. To keep things consistent, I use the restroom and wear nothing but underwear before weighing myself. I take note of my weight in my fitness app (Google Fit).

My diet is, well, a little more complicated. I guess the closest thing you could label it as is intermittent fasting. Calories aren't something I'm interested in tracking meticulously, but I'll read the nutrition label for anything I don't already know and keep a pseudo-tally in mind, so I can make conscious choices about what to eat later on. Because of a new job I've started, I'll eat around 6:00p. I'll get a salad or some granola bars, something light with at least some kind of fruit/vegetable. After work (around 11p) I'll get something for myself as a ""treat"" for sticking to my routine. I keep the portions as small as possible, for example: a chicken sandwish w/o mayo, or a value hamburger.

It took me 22 months, first 6 was really where the most changes happened and then slowly with a few hiccups. 
Anyways, I am looking for maintenance/ toning advice.
My progress is mainly due to diet. 

For weight loss: F20, 5""3, 110lbs, -1300kcal, mostly sedentary during the week + around 2hrs/week cycling + around 16 hrs/ week waiting tables

Now with all that I was losing weight (not persistent as in nothing, nothing, boom 4 lbs down)
The question is how do I change to maintenance? Should I start at 1500 for a week and see how it goes or perhaps jump straight to 1700? Or maybe something else?
I've been on the diet so long I don't want to just ""drop"" the calories counting just yet, I also don't really have time for gym to tone but would appreciate something I could do at home.

Finally Losing It - Fuck The System!,227,suhi3c,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suhi3c/finally_losing_it_fuck_the_system/,29,"Sorry, I know this sounds angsty, but hear me out.

I'm in my 30s, male, and I hit my highest weight this year of 361 and was alerted that I would soon give myself liver damage if I didn't do something about it.

I've tried so many things in the past to lose weight, and I can always drop the first 5 pounds fast, and work really hard over months to drop another 5 or 10, but then it all comes back because I give up or quit.  I've been doing this since I was 12.  It's exhausting.  Medication, meal plans, weight watchers, keto, Paleo, juicing, literally starving myself (aka slimfast).

Over the past couple of years, I've picked up some habits that are all culminating in success this time around.

1. Cook from scratch.  I don't know if this is common to everyone, but I legitimately ate probably 80% of my meals at fast food.  Or, at best, pre-packaged microwave ""healthy"" meals.  You know, this shit you eat and you're hungry 30 minutes later?  Funny how that never works.  Once I started cooking at home, I found I'm able to make the food I want, and eat it without feeling guilty because I get satisfied quickly and stop eating.  Fried chicken was always a weakness.  I could eat a Caniac (6 chicken tenders with a sauce) and still be hungry.  I can make something that tastes even better at home now, and I'm barely able to force down 3 smaller tenders.  This has been huge.  People always say ""eat real food"" but I never understood why.  Long story short, fake food confuses our bodies and makes us overeat.

2. Don't drink sodas.  Diet sodas are fine right?  Especially that Stevia sweetened stuff?  No.  Fuck it all.  Carbonated drinks, especially with caffeine, will basically get you something akin to a high while eating.  You'll enjoy food longer than you should and associate the drink with the food.  Super sugary or super sweet, combined with a stimulant?  That's a shortcut to get your brain to associate some slime served on a bun or in a tortilla with a good time and fuel a legitimate addiction.  Here's where the fuck the system part comes in.  Restaurants want you to get a drink, diet or not, to hook you onto their shitty ass food.  Diet is even better, because it confuses your senses even more!  It tastes sweet, but there's no calories coming in, so your brain tells you to eat more food!

3. Talk through your feelings.  I think this is frowned upon in America, particularly for guys.  It took a long time and a lot of discussion, but I finally came to a realization of why I would get demotivated with weight loss attempts in the past even after a short period of time.  I had a tendency to lose 5 pounds easily, and then think ""pfft, this is easy.  I'm awesome.  I could lose all this weight no problem.  Cool, proved it to myself, done"".  Stupid, right?  I was literally afraid of success.  I didn't, and frankly still don't know what skinny me will look like.  I don't want to become the skinny as a twig guy.  Guess what?  I don't have to be.  I can lift weights while I lose weight and work on building my physique.  Again, fuck the system we live in.  You have to be honest with yourself to move forward.

I started this journey on January 18, 2022 at 361 pounds.  As of this morning, I am down to 344, and I feel like I have literally not had to try at all.  Eating food that isn't full of additives (artificial fats and sweeteners) that trick my brain into eating more, not drinking sodas that further an addiction and trick my brain into eating more, and being honest with myself about my past attempts and fears has felt very un-American and yet freeing.  It's a long way to go to my goal weight of 200, but I know I can get there with the tools I have now.

Fuck fake food.
Fuck corporations forcing an addiction onto our population.
And fuck toxic masculinity keeping us from being honest with ourselves.",1645077488.0
Gained 10lbs can't stop eating,6,sv55sh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv55sh/gained_10lbs_cant_stop_eating/,7,"Help!  
Last January I set out to get healthy. I began exercising more regularly, doing yoga, ate less and ate healthier. By the summer I had lost 20lbs! Very exciting.  


...And then I started to gain weight. At first I didn't mind because I was a little too small for my own tastes and wanted to put on muscle - which I did! Awesome.  


But since around November, with the stress of finals and just general winter blues, I've put on even more. I've gained 10lbs back. I'm not exercising as much (heavier university course load, part time job and bad weather makes it difficult to be consistent), and I just. Can't. Stop. Eating.  


Seriously. I think I've been eating like 2500-3000+ calories a day, every single day, for months. I feel disgusted with myself. I know I'm still slim, I know I've kept half of the weight off, but I just can't stop eating. I don't know how to stop. Every day I tell myself ""I will stick to my goal today"". And every day I just eat and eat and eat.

Weight trending up despite heavy caloric deficit/strict fitness regimen...new issue,0,svjn4n,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svjn4n/weight_trending_up_despite_heavy_caloric/,12,"**I'm a 26yo male, 6'2 (188cm) and currently 293lbs (133kg).** I have a large and athletic build and would say I look and feel the most fit at around 220lbs, but am targeting 235lbs. I began strictly tracking my caloric intake on 1/24 and weighed in at 287.6 and have since been on a \~1,450kcal diet with macros of roughly 107/42/138 tracked in MFP. I weigh all relevant food and eat more or less the exact same thing every single day (only delta may stem from some add'l plain non-fat greek yogurt, maybe a banana before the gym on heavier lift days, \~210 add'l calories). I drink roughly 3 - 5 liters of water per day with a target of 1gal/day. No alcohol, only supplements I'm taking is fortified collagen for some caloric-light protein intake with my preworkout in the evening. I average out to 8 hours of sleep per night and the only ancillary factor that may be detrimental is that I'm wound very tight and am typically under a good bit of  stress due to the nature of my work (likely heightened cortisol levels, have not confirmed). I run 2 miles per day in the evening after work/dinner and before I lift. I alternate between traditional strength training with classic muscle groupings and a HIIT cardio/core session every other day (I've lost a large amount of weight before and I do this solely for aesthetics, I like to have a lean look once I knock the fat). I'm not currently lifting for muscle growth (not trying to push one rep PRs) and am instead hitting \~75% capacity across muscle groups at increased reps.

**Fast forward a month** and I've been tracking my weight Friday mornings first thing, no water, wearing nothing but a smile, and after using the bathroom. Week 1 I weighed in at 289.8, didn't think much of it as my weight ebbs and flows a couple pounds per day. Week 2, exact same weight at 289.8. Week 3, 290.9, and week 4 (this morning) I'm 293.4. I'm starting to get a little nervous that something is up with me...my body is seemingly ignoring basic principles of thermodynamics.

**Additional relevant context:** I played rugby at uni and upon graduation I dropped from 305lbs to 215lbs with this ***identical*** regiment, it took about 9 months and results occurred **almost immediately** upon execution of this regiment, like, within days. Over the course of the past two years I've put on about 55lbs due to mistreating myself very harshly including consistently massive alcohol consumption, complete disregard to fitness, and not paying attention to what I eat. I'm beginning to get nervous that I did some sort of irreparable damage to myself these past couple years. I've been diagnosed with a major chronic depressive disorder and am on an anti-depressant medication which I've been consulted has no ramifications on weight or metabolism. I've made major strides mentally and emotionally and my fitness is the last piece of the triad.

For anyone questioning the sustainability of the magnitude of this caloric deficit, I've tapered some calories week-over-week to see if my BMR calculations are just skewed and I wasn't actually in too deep of a cut to no avail.

tl;dr: What the fuck is going on?

EDIT: I'm also assuming there is minimal-to-no impact to body weight via muscle recomposition as I am not a stranger to the gym.

EDIT2: I'm on a 45mg daily dosage of remeron (generic mirtazapine)",1645195559.0
Didn't realize how overweight I was until I lost ~15lbs in short order by cutting out snacks and dessert,54,sunvat,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sunvat/didnt_realize_how_overweight_i_was_until_i_lost/,2,"I'm a guy that carries his extra weight on his legs and hips. I come from a big legged family, so carrying an extra \~20lbs was something I always just kind of accepted as part of it. I'm fairly fitness forward and had some definition on my abdominal muscles, so it wasn't something I worried about.

I was in the habit for several years of going through a \~9.5oz bag of potato chips a week and eating ice cream and sweets around every other day or so. Snacking was also an ""activity"" my ex and I shared while parking in front of the television at night, and one that I enabled. I hovered around 195lbs (at 6'1"" tall), cycling between days of snacking and days of relative fasting. I wasn't *gaining* weight, at any rate. This was with six runs over 25-30 miles and two weight-lifting sessions a week.

Being somewhat diet conscious because fitness is important to me, I'd been resolving over the past year to develop a healthier relationship with food. Started with eating a more nutritious and less meat focused diet, and recently transitioned to focus on not snacking as an outlet for boredom. So I stopped buying chips and I stopped buying candy and ice cream. My feeling was that if I wanted a snack, I could make a sandwich or something.

Been doing this for maybe two months. Weighed myself the last time maybe a few weeks before that when I was around 195lbs. Started weighing myself on a whim over the past few days and I'm down to \~180lbs. This is almost *entirely* just from eating less, because I'd stopped running over the same interim due to shin splints.

The results are shocking to me. The ease at which that weight came off means that I've been deluding myself for years. I thought 195lbs was just my baseline, but I'm now effortlessly at a healthier weight simply because I'm not eating junk. I can see exactly where it came off, too, because my butt shrank. I don't miss the junk food at all. It's certainly not worth going back there.

Need to emphasize again that I'm completely surprised. This wasn't a specific goal of mine, just a consequence of making active choices. Sharing because maybe it will help someone living behind the same sort of delusions to start actively considering whether the consequences of snacking are worth their current weight. Nothing wrong, however, with deciding that it's okay. Developing a healthy relationship with food, to me, simply means owning and being happy with your choices.",1645101605.0

Constantly sabotaged by sugar addiction,9,sv11qr,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv11qr/constantly_sabotaged_by_sugar_addiction/,11,"I'm a 5'3 woman, \~150 lbs, and I guess binging my whole life and being active as a teen gave me a fast metabolism. I tracked my caloric intake and weight over a few months last year. A BMR calculator said I was supposed to burn \~2000 calories a day at my activity level, but I was burning closer to 2500. It should be easy for me to get back to a healthy weight, but it's not because of an intense sugar addiction. 

I have always loved sugar. I have distinct memories as a kid of walking to the store with a bunch of quarters that I found in the laundry room and secretly buying 1 lb bags of twizzlers, or tubs of frosting, and eating these things in 1 day. I don't drink soda or juice, but I love sugary food. Ever since I graduated high school a few years ago, I have eaten large amounts of sugar most days. A ""share"" sized bag of reese's, a pack of cookies, a pint of ice cream, I just always have to finish the day with something sweet and huge. I depend on it so much that the only time I have ever come close to my goal weight (120 lbs) was when I just ate 1300 calories of mostly candy and baked goods almost every day. I don't keep treats in my apartment unless I intend to eat all of them that day. Sometimes I am successful at cutting back on sugar, or almost entirely cutting it out, but it never lasts more than a few weeks. 

For the past few days I have been trying to transition away from it again. Instead of buying a giant bag of candy late at night, I buy a regular sized chocolate bar and eat it in the middle of the day for lunch. If I eat it in the middle of the day, I won't be tempted to buy something bigger. Plus, as long as I've had something sweet, I tend to not feel those intense cravings at night. Right now, I feel like I have to do this or else I will lose control.

I know that I'm destroying my health in the long run with this lifestyle, and that's why I'm trying to overcome it. I'm just scared that I will fall off the bandwagon as I always do. How do people get away from sugar cravings, long-term?",1645136350.0

And this is what he has to say, I’m doing his fatloss program 3 

”I do not inherently believe in “fat loss” programs.  I prefer to think in terms of improving body composition. “Losing fat” or “losing weight” is simple. If you have the discipline to diet hard and the motivation to just pile on the work you will be able to lose weight, but you might very well lose muscle in the process. If you are a natural trainee with average genetics, getting lean while becoming muscular can be a complex juggling act because the type of work you need to do to lose fat can actually make you lose muscle too. This program is designed to allow you to get much leaner while maintaining or even adding muscle mass. Of course, a solid fat loss diet should also be used, but this program is structured in such a way to optimize the training process to help you reach your body comp goals.”

2 toilet questions about dieting/losing weight,1,svdfck,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/svdfck/2_toilet_questions_about_dietinglosing_weight/,4,"Hi

Been losing weight for about 18 months now, going great.

A couple of times I've had some fun (sometimes A LOT of fun for a pretty long period) with crap food, mostly snacks and sugary stuff (been testing some US snacks lately, and I ALWAYS buy way too much).

And I noticed 2 things:

 \- when I eat mostly sugar, and an insane amount of food in a day (way way more than needed), I need to pee a lot less than when I eat a normal quantity of food, and very ""good"" food. I drink the same amount of water. I put that on more food = it aborbs more water, is that the reason? Or is it linked to sugar?  
And it's immediate. First day of re-dieting, I pee a lot more.

 \- when I eat mostly sugar, I go more often for number 2 (which I can understand, because I also eat A LOT more), but, and that's where I don't get it, it's just easier to do that number 2. Way easier. When I eat mostly fibers & proteins (basically, eggs in the morning, meat + vegetables + fruits for lunch & dinner), it's just way harder. Don't want to get graphical, but I need to push a lot more.

And that I don't get. I drink the same amount, I do the same amount of exercize. You always hear that to have a good transit, you need fiber. Am I wired wrong or something? Like sugar is my fiber :/

Is there science behind that? Anyone else has experience with both sides, and is it the same?

The problem is, as soon as I hit the target BMI threshold, I stopped losing. I can’t seem to push myself any further, even though I still “feel” like I’m dieting.

I often welcomed those who have lost 100+ lbs (\~ 50 kg , \~7 stone) to “the club” and joked that club meetings were on Thursdays, and that joke has evolved into this regular weekly thread to talk about issues that are particular to those who have lost 100+ lbs, those who are well on their way as well as anyone who is just at the beginning of a journey this big.

Each week I will usually provide a topic of the day that has been on my mind or inspired by recent posts or comments. However you are free to talk about any topics you think might be relevant to current and prospective club members.

**Comments**

I’m traveling for work this week, living in a hotel for 4 nights and eating restaurant food. Meals with friends and colleagues and working meals.

I was delayed by the travel gods and arrived shortly before a company wide meeting. Before he started speaking our CEO asked: Where’s SmilingJaguar? I told him I was right behind him. “Oh there you are! You’re so skinny these days I didn’t see you!”. He’s a big guy. Probably weighs close to what I used to weigh but Carrie’s it better than I did.

Another colleague I’ve known for over 5 years saw me go back for seconds at lunch yesterday and commented “Oh! You do still eat!” He’s a lanky dude about 10 years younger than I. 

Meanwhile I know I’m still about 5-10 above where I want to be. 

I avoided going to a karaoke after party where there was going to be lots of drinking after a company dinner. Fortunately I found a colleague who also wasn’t feeling the scene, and we headed back to our hotel safely.

Lots of booze, lots of food, lots of work, lots of idle comments. 

It feels good to be back in a busier office than the past two years. Seeing old friends and colleagues and not having to mask and isolate quite as much as we have in the past 6 months or so that I have been going back to the office.

Anyhow today’s topic is comments. What have you heard recently? How does it affect you? Do you respond?

What’s going on in your life Centurion?",1645109837.0
new low after messing up!!,25,suos6i,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suos6i/new_low_after_messing_up/,3,"A few days ago I posted about how I failed to mindfully eat pretzel chips and frozen cherries in front of the TV. Not quite bingy but certainly more than 600-1000 cals over what my normal daily amount is.

Well, after a couple days of carb weight, today I hit a new low! 129.2. Just 0.2 down from the previous low but any movement in the right direction is a win!! Just wanted to post this as an encouragement for others in this spot.

I did NOT fast or punish myself for any of the oopsie. Not knocking the people with luck on IF, but I just can’t. I got back on the horse and kept listening to my body and it turns out I was gradually less hungry over the next few days and must have balanced something out. I’m not trying to lose any more drastic weight. Just trying to make listening to my body a lifelong habit and seeing where it takes me. Hopefully it takes me to a point where the type 2 diabetes, cholesterol, and liver issues are in the rear view mirror.

I think a little more self-love helped me not take my 600-1000 cal oopsie beyond that into a full-blown binge. I *did* try to be mindful even as I was going down the slippery slope that night. Tried to enjoy the chips and find joy in it without shame. Tried to nip the all or nothing idea in the bud. Thanks for listening. So glad I can share this “win” with everyone.",1645104392.0
Does a caloric deficit cause sleeping problems?

I tried researching online but couldnt really find anything about my case. Tho i read somewhere that on a deficit your body is staying up longer as a survival mechanism to forage for food? However I read another thing saying a deficit makes sleep better because the body tries conserving energy? So i am pretty lost.

For context my tdee is 2200 so I am eating 1700. Meal time is 12pm and 7pm. I have coffee, 1 cup in the morning same as I have been doing for 10 years now.

I feel like if I had a better or clearer understanding of how fat actually is burned or leaves your body and at what rate, I would be a bit more driven. I tend to fall off track when I get lost in the process of weight loss. 

Many of you are probably going to comment with “why do you care how it leaves your body, just work for it” or some answer like that. But I’m really trying to visualize it since it helps me manifest my end goal a bit easier. 

For example, once you are eating less, when does your body register that it’s going to dispose of fat tissue? It would be super helpful if anyone could share their mindset or perspective of the process of fat loss. Usually when I’m struggling or getting distracted, I simply need to focus my attention on the facts of weight loss and that I can trust my body’s natural process.",1645085375.0
Help with TDEE activity level estimation for body recomposition,3,sv1a8b,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv1a8b/help_with_tdee_activity_level_estimation_for_body/,2,"Ive been trying to find my maintenance calories in order to calculate a slight caloric deficit and achieve recomposition. I have some issues calculating the activity level though. My job is mostly a desk job and I spend 30 min walking to work, apart from that I lift weights for about 1 and a half hour and do LISS ( 12 incline 3 mph walking machine) for 30 min, 6 times a week.  So about two hours of activity. I like to go pretty hard when lifting weights. I'm 24M 177 cm 190lbs (when I started) and Ive been consuming 2000 calories per day. According to a TDEE calculator if I consider myself sedentary I would be doing a 200 calorie deficit. I considered said level of activity because I spend most of my day sitting. I use a fitbit but I think the calorie counter is way off so I dont take it into consideration (around 3000 per day apparently.). Ive been doing this for three weeks so far and ive lost three pounds and notice some gains everywhere (im currently at 187lbs)  but I feel I might not be consuming enough calories and cutting too much.

Sustaining weight loss,4,suypat,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suypat/sustaining_weight_loss/,2,So about 6 years ago I started a weight loss journey and lost 75 lbs. I was at my lowest adult weight ever. Then a bunch of life struggles happened and I gained it back. I’ve always been overweight. I have since gathered a better understanding of myself and I am putting my health first. One of the biggest issues I had when I lost the weight was the acceptance of no longer being invisible to people. I went from never being noticed to getting way more attention then I was comfortable with. I made some poor impulsive decisions. I now know I am likely autistic and adhd. How do I begin to start accepting that if I lose the weight again more people will see me? I have done a lot of trauma work but since I’ve always been overweight this is so difficult.,1645130355.0

Some questions considering calories burned throughout the day,0,sv7dlc,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv7dlc/some_questions_considering_calories_burned/,3,"So I’ve been trying to enter a calorie deficit of 300-500 calories a day, and there are a few things I’ve been wondering revolving around how many calories I burn off in a day.

First, is all of my BMR completely burned off throughout the day no matter what, or does it depend on what goes on during that day? (ex. barely any exercise such as walking when needed vs. implied exercise.) Can I add the amount of calories I would burn from exercise to my BMR to get the total number of calories I burned that day? 
I also pay attention to a step tracker on my phone that I would say is pretty accurate. If I were to walk one mile through short intervals of walking when I needed to without knowing, would I be burning off the same amount as I would going outside and intentionally walking one mile? 
Also considering nutrition labels… I know they can be pretty inaccurate when it comes to calories. Obviously calories aren’t everything, but I don’t want to be getting more in throughout my meals that would make me eat a lot more than I think. Is it good to overestimate by 10% or less every so often? I don’t want to overestimate too much to the point I’m starving myself and not giving myself what I need.",1645153922.0
What's the best way to manually log steps in MFP?,2,sv2ght,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv2ght/whats_the_best_way_to_manually_log_steps_in_mfp/,4,"I have a stupid pedometer watch, literally just counts steps.

But I still got almost 15,000 extra steps in. In the past I've created an exercise to log steps taken as minutes exercised, but now the numbers are way off. Is there a better way? Is there a really good steps taken to calories burned calculator online so I can just log it as a different exercise but get those calories?

(Again, yes, I know usually you shouldn't log steps as exercise, but I went for this day long park trip specifically to get this exercise in)",1645140042.0

I’ve been losing weight for about 6 months now (taken a couple months break in between) and I have lost around 12 kgs. Everything has gone well until recently.

For the past 6 months I have eaten the almost the exact types of foods and amounts, each month decreasing slightly to consider my obviously decrease in TDEE. Obviously I’ve lost the weight, however for the past week I’ve just been rapidly gaining weight (around 0.5kg a day).

I’ve been eating exactly as normal (1200 calories) I weigh my food and eat the exact same things/amounts. 

I know it doesn’t have anything to do with my period as it isn’t for another two weeks, and I’d usually never gain anything more than 0.5kg. I haven’t increased my exercise or anything, I’m not constipated, and I even have a second scale which also says I’m gaining. Even today I tried decreasing my intake by 200 calories and I’m still gaining...

I guess I’m just extremely confused and frustrated by this and it’s making me extremely upset. I’m doing everything that I have done for the past half a year, and out of nowhere my body is putting on weight extremely rapidly. Do anyone have an ideas to why this is?",1645093989.0

However, I’m choosing not to be upset with myself over it. I know when I’m back on my routine (Saturday) it won’t be a hard adjustment. I know that it would be worse to completely deny myself joy / emotional support toaster strudel.

Long time lurker, but making my debut with a post I’ve had on my mind for some time now. 

Since January 10, I’ve been participating in a fitness challenge put on by a woman I have followed on social media for the past few years. I’ve historically really liked the information she has put out, and have also appreciated her (presumably) real world approach to weight/fat loss and getting in shape. Her following is full of normal looking humans with normal results. She, herself, is quite lean and quite frankly has a pretty amazing figure. 

I would generally consider myself somewhat well-read on the basics of nutrition, and have taken extra care to focus my efforts on trying to learn the best information for my own personal situation. I understand the concept of BMR, TDEE, and the like. I get the gist of macros and importance of protein, etc. I’ve had some great movement on the scale for the month or so I have been participating in this challenge, but I’m wondering if the community might be able to provide some anecdotal (or science-backed) methodologies you have all used to get yourself back to eating at just a slight deficit with the intention of returning to maintenance eventually. Right now, this plan (and we are in the latter half of the challenge) has me eating 1,345 calories per day with 6 days per week of moderate-intensity exercise…. This is down from 1,429 calories over the first four weeks. For context, I am 29F and about 5’6.5”. I’d like to avoid shocking my body and putting myself into an awkward situation with lots of bloating/plateauing/water retention. How slow should I increase my calories? Any macro group or anything specific I should focus on increasing slower or faster than others? These are the types of questions I’m looking at getting your help with. 

A disclaimer to avoid any messages related to this being dangerous or what have you…This is obviously not ideal long term, as it is quite frankly not even what my BMR calories are, not to mention how far below my TDEE. I’m currently overweight for my height and will be returning to a maintainable level of calories and such in a couple weeks. I also want to note that I have and do allow myself to exceed this calorie count if needed, and I do also skip high intensity workouts in favor of brisk walks and such if I am not feeling up to pushing myself. So for what that’s worth. 

Also, please let me know if any additional information would be helpful to add.

why some people naturally maintain a ridiculous skinny body despite biological reasons to not be at that state?,0,sv9w3b,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv9w3b/why_some_people_naturally_maintain_a_ridiculous/,6,"i swear, my friend's brother is tall and so skinny. he doesn't seem to consciously care about his diet, eating ""simple carbs"" in great quantities (the type of food that makes you more hungry), and he is so skinny. also he doesn't have that much muscle, you can see more bones.
i used him as an example, but there's more people with his type of body.
what i can't understand is how this can happen.
why their bodies aren't desperate to find food and thus makes them feel excessive hunger? and they aren't lethargic at all. also why an average person can't maintain the same body as theirs without feeling extremely hungry and feeling horrible(making it not sustainable)? is it some hormonal difference, metabolism advantage?

Lost 30KG but the battle only just started.,2,suwtgp,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suwtgp/lost_30kg_but_the_battle_only_just_started/,3,"Hello I'm gonna explain things right away. Im a 22 years old male. Height is 184cm I struggled with obesity the entirety of my childhood. At 18 I was 101kg. I decided it's time i just start working towards the goal of losing weight. Now. My body at that weight. It was fat obviously however the fat mostly accumulated on my thighs stomach and central areas the most. My limbs were always on the skinnier part. So I began losing weight through gym and changing diet. But it was in no way consistent and gradual. I took many breaks. I relapsed a few times and over time alot of trial and error. I dropped 30Kgs at the time I was very proud and happy and maintained at 70kg. Not undermining how much of a progress that is. But here comes the worst part. But I've done a terrible mistake not paying attention to my diet. Looking at the scale only. And not lifting weights or had been consistently working out. 

Here I am right now. Skinny yet fat. My wrists and arms are super skinny yet when i sit down my stomach is merged with my thighs and everything sticks to each other. I look like a titan from attack on titans. An absolute freak of a body. It feels like it's beyond saving. Do i have a condition or a disease. Why does every male body i see have thin or square shaped center. It's absolutely killing me everyday. Do i go to the gym and bulk but how can i even dare to touch food to gain weight when my thighs are still looking like someone's who over 110kg. How dare i lose weight while my arms look like someone's whos underweight. All while keeping in mind that im 184cms and 73kg. It feels like absolutely soul crushing. Everything is floppy. I look absolutely disgusting without clothes on. Boney yet saggy.",1645125414.0
My Weight Loss Story So Far,31,suft7r,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suft7r/my_weight_loss_story_so_far/,4,"  

Before the pandemic, I made a conscious decision that I wanted to lose weight. I dont know where I started, but around March 2020, i was down to 280.

And then covid

While my family was fortunate not to get sick, we took on some house guests for about 6 months. Those house guests enjoyed their snack food, and having desserts after dinner. Being around them, I would partake, and could tell I was slowly gain back weight. I didnt think too much about it, it was still the early stages of covid, and there were bigger things to worry about. 

Early October 2021 I got back on the scale, and holy crap I weighed in at 303. I dont know whether i had ever weighed over 300 pounds before, but that was a very big number to me, and I knew i had to do something about it. 

I started to think about how I wanted to approach my diet. Being married, I am not always in control of my menu items. I had realized that it would be difficult for me to control my dinner choices, but lunch was something that was entirely up to me, so i worked off of that. 

I started to cut back, getting rid of junk food, soda, and all of the other crap in my life, and also started only having salad's for lunch. It was going well, and towards the middle of December I was down to 290 pounds. It is not a staggering amount of weight, but I felt proud that I was no longer a member of the 300 club. 

Once getting rid of junk and eating salads became normal for me, I decided i wanted to be more aggressive with my weight loss. I started to incorporate intermittent fasting, and eating only dinner during the week. I also bought myself a stationary bike (not a peleton, just something stupid i was able to pick up for under $300), and to my wife's dismay, I put the bike right in front of the tv. I wasnt using the bike as often as I wanted, further upsetting her that the bike was in the middle of the room for no reason. 

I made a decision that I would only play video games while riding the bike. 

It worked. I started using the bike daily, with the goal of riding five miles. 

These drastic changes to my life are not easy. I am hungry all of the time, and am constantly tired.

So far is worth it. I can now ride about 10 miles a day on the bike, and today, for the first time since college, cracked below 260 pounds! 

The question now is where I go from here. I think i am going to set a goal of getting to 200 pounds. When I started this journey, the idea of losing over 100 pounds was unimaginable and still seem daunting. The difference is that now I feel like I am up for the challenge. Instead of asking myself whether i will be able to take off the weight, I am now asking how I will keep it off after accomplishing my goals. 

In summary, here is how i lost the weight:

&#x200B;

1. Find one thing i could control with regard to my weight      loss goals, and control it. 
2. Once I was able to accomplish that, I started to realize      more things that I could control, and incorporated them into my daily      life. 
3. Before eating my daily meal, i start with a big salad,      its cliché, but it helps curbs hunger for the real (more caloric) food. 
4. When I cheat, I cheat hard I decided early on, that it      would be too difficult for me to diet on the weekend. It is actually      pretty nuts. I lose about 10 pounds during the week and gain 8 back on the      weekend, netting about 2.5 pounds of weight loss a week. Is this a bad      approach, probably, but it works for me. 

I am so embarrassed about my starting weight that I have kept the details of my weight loss from my family and friends. When someone asks me whether i have lost weight, i shrug it off saying, ""yea, a few pounds.""

Today I decided that I wanted to share my story (so far), and what better way to do so, than anonymously on the internet. I have lost over 40 pounds, and it is a BIG DEAL!",1645071824.0
Has anyone here successfully continued weight loss while being on an extended vacation? Can you tell me how you did it?,1,sv1glm,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv1glm/has_anyone_here_successfully_continued_weight/,4,"I’m taking the “slow and steady” approach this time, tracking calories and macros via the Loseit app, alternating a small deficit with maintenance. I’m establishing some good new habits and feeling optimistic. The scale is slowly but steadily trending down. But.....

I’ll be visiting family for a month in the spring and tracking will be challenging, if not possible. We’ll be eating at least dinner together every day, often lunch, and it will be prepared by someone who is mindful of her own health, but *completely* anti-calorie counting.

The thought of not tracking for a month sends chills down my spine. It took me so long to work up to trying—yet again—to lose weight. My progress feels fragile.

I’m considering switching to OMAD for the month, but worry it’ll trigger binge eating.

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 17, 2022",9,sum6kk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sum6kk/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_17_2022/,0,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

Does binging once cancel a two weeks worth of cutting?,0,sv0394,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv0394/does_binging_once_cancel_a_two_weeks_worth_of/,12,"I'm pretty good with calorie counting, it's just that I regularly binge at least twice a month. Often my binges surpass the amount of calories I was cutting for one week maybe even two weeks. So my question is will my body store all those extra calories as fat or will it poop them away? I saw a post here saying not to worry about holiday/christmas food you overate because you will poo it out. Christmas is the time I binge the most. While hearing this did make me happy, is it scientifically accurate to say binging at least just once in a while won't cancel out my previous cutting?

Hypoglycemia? Diets…,0,sv53n4,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sv53n4/hypoglycemia_diets/,7,"Just for reference I am 26, ever since I was about 13 I remember getting lightheaded and jittery along with shaky hands and stuttering (could be considered slurred speech sometimes) whenever I don’t eat for a few hours. My mom never got me tested for it but I remember fainting twice because of it in my younger years but not since… I just moved to a new city and haven’t found a doctor that takes my insurance so I’m just here basically to ask if anyone here has hypoglycemia and how it affects their weight loss??
I’m not trying to self diagnose but based off my symptoms and what I have looked up online it seems to be a condition I could possibly have.
For example: I used to work at a call center and they would schedule our breaks for lunch, I would clock in at 8am and usually skip breakfast if I were running late around I would have a 15min break around 10 which wasn’t enough time to eat and my lunch would be 12’ish by that time I would have trouble concentrating on calls and my hands would shake and I would just feel weak overall.
I had co workers who would wait until lunch to eat as well but they would be fine aside a normal stomach growl…

I’m successfully maintaining but mentally struggling.,164,stz7oe,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stz7oe/can_we_talk_life_after_weight_loss_im/,47,"tl;dr: I'm feeling way more anxious and neurotic about calorie-counting now that I'm trying to maintain weight because I'm afraid of relapse/regain. Looking for thoughts and advice on how to maintain weight without anxiety and calorie counting.

\----------

The victory is oh so sweet. I lost over 180 pounds, and a little over one month ago I hit my goal weight. Loose skin and all, I feel healthier and happier in my body than I ever have in my life. 

Now the next journey begins, the one that gets talked about so much less… keeping the weight off. 

For some context, I lost weight almost exclusively by paying attention to CICO—consuming fewer calories than I use. Now, my goal is to consume equal calories to what I use.

My body *loves* having a larger calorie budget and no longer being in a deficit. Being fully and properly fueled, the difference is palpable especially when I’m working out.

My mind, however, is having a hard time adapting. This phase feels much more mentally challenging than weight loss did. 

When I was in a deficit, I was so patient and gracious with myself. If I went 100 calories over my budget for the day, fine. I was still in a calorie deficit, so it’s not a big deal. I kept my eyes on the prize. Now, I feel myself becoming much more anxious and obsessive about calorie counting to make sure I don’t go over my budget. Because now, if I break my budget I could actually gain weight. I find myself so afraid of backsliding into old habits and regaining all the weight. It feels like I’m developing some kind of yet-unnamed eating disorder. 

I don’t want to count calories for the rest of my life, but I do want to keep the weight off for good. Where is the middle ground? How do I maintain weight without anxious calorie counting?

My current plan of action is to study Intuitive Eating. As I study, I’ll keep counting calories to get familiar with what a numerically-appropriate amount of daily consumption feels like. And then, I hope that through using the principles of Intuitive Eating, I can ween myself off of MyFitnessPal, and ultimately delete it. 

Anyone else out there successfully maintaining weight? Please share your thoughts!",1645026921.0
Are there any foods you find yourself just naturally avoiding while in a deficit?,63,su6kko,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/su6kko/are_there_any_foods_you_find_yourself_just/,26,"Last night I sat down in front of TV with a container of Häagen-Dazs sorbet. I had every intention of eating all of it. I had “budgeted” for it. I had a favourite show cued up. I was *ready.*

And I ate maybe 5 spoonfuls.

The first was delicious. So was the second. But I was less enamored with the third. And the fourth was too sweet. I almost pushed myself past the fifth, just for the comfort of the routine. But I imagined how I’d feel after, and for once the thought of that slightly sick, slightly tranquilized feeling didn’t appeal to me. 

I reached for some fizzy lime Perrier instead, watched my show, and went to bed.

SOS (long post),3,suoiyr,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suoiyr/sos_long_post/,7,"Hi. I've (5ft4/f) been on a weightloss journey for a hot minute now and have run into a problem I cannot seem to solve on my own so any advice is welcome. 

Back in november, I had my IUD (Inter uterine device/birth control) removed and I went from wild cravings all of the time to not having any hunger ques. I eat well (when I do), rarely eat junk food, make everything at home and check my calories. 

I. Cannot. Eat. 

I cant force myself to eat if I dont feel hungry apparently and have resorted to eating calorically dense food just to make an attempt at reaching a healthy calorie limit. 

I lost a fair amount of weight about a year ago and then college happened and it has slowly crept back up DESPITE the lack of hunger and inability to eat, I'm not losing or gaining and I'm getting really frustrated. 

I can manage 700 to 1200 calories a day if I try real hard. Yes, I am aware that is probably way too low. 

I try to fit in at least 30min of exercise twice a week and still religiously watch my calories. 

Have y'all had this issue? Do you have any advice? I'm feeling stuck and overwhelmed with it all if I'm being honest.",1645103605.0
My mom body shames me,22,sudolk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sudolk/my_mom_body_shames_me/,15,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but it relates to weight, fitness, and body positivity issues. 

I (32F) am currently at my heaviest weight (240 lb). No excuses, I just haven’t been prioritizing my health and it caught up to me. I am confident that I can lose the excess weight as I have done it before. But to be honest, at this particular time, I am more concerned with focusing on my mental health (I have been struggling with depression and ptsd and some days struggle even get out of bed) than the weight loss. 

That is all background info: the issue is that my mom, who is extremely fit, tends to body shame me. She bullies me into doing physical activities (hiking, biking, etc) with her and then gets irritated with me when I can’t keep up with her. Even besides the difference in fitness, she’s about a foot taller than me so even at my fittest, I could never keep up with her. The last time I went hiking with her, she literally abandoned me on the side of a mountain and just took off. Afterwards, she is always self righteous about it—‘if I don’t like being left behind I should be fitter and so I don’t have a right to be upset about it.’

To be clear, when I am on my own or with other people who go my speed, I genuinely like hiking/biking/etc. I just don’t enjoy the side of humiliation. 

Now, we are planning an upcoming trip to visit with my sister. I requested that instead of the suggested bike ride, we go to a museum or stroll around a botanical garden etc—I offered several such activities and my sister and I were able to come up with a variety of fun things that we could all do. My mom was pissed that I nixed the bike ride plan. She tried to guilt me into going saying that my sister and brother in law really wanted to go and would be disappointed (I don’t think they were). She accused me of thinking the world revolves around me. I explained that it’s frustrating for both of us when we go at different speeds so let’s just do something else. Then she started with the “just because you aren’t fit enough to do—“ and I hung up on her. 

I am not really looking for advice tbh, especially not of the “throw the whole mother out” variety. I just wanted a place to vent hopefully to some sympathetic ears. 

TLDR—my fit mom shames me when I can’t keep up and shames me when I try to avoid the situation",1645065476.0
The motivation I needed but didn't want,132,stz8my,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stz8my/the_motivation_i_needed_but_didnt_want/,11,"Recently, I had a bout of chest pains that caused me to see the doctor. While at the doctor they did their tests and found that I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol and am pre-diabetic. There are concerns about my heart health and overall health.

This caused me to reevaluate my habits. Maybe I should eat better, maybe I should be more active. This was a bit of an eye-opener that it's time to get started.

As I mulled all this information over and decided what day I should start, or when to ""make a plan,"" I got a call from a friend. A lifelong friend of mine just died. I hadn't seen him in several years. I asked what happened. Heart problems and complications from open heart surgery. All the things my doctor was warning me about a week prior took the life of my friend. We're not old, we're in our 30s. He'll never live to see 40 and now I have the wakeup call I cannot ignore. If I don't make changes, I may not see 40 either.

So... the time is now. The day is here. I've got an appointment with a nutritionist, I've thrown away the terrible junk foods I find myself binging on and I've dusted off my cardio equipment.

Does anybody have trouble eating when counting calories?,0,suuqeh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suuqeh/does_anybody_have_trouble_eating_when_counting/,10,So I've struggled with counting calories for a long time and I was never able to verbalize why until yesterday. I got up yesterday and found myself craving a soda instead of my morning coffee. I Haven't had a soda in about a week and I wasn't worried about it throwing off my calorie count so I didn't see a problem in treating myself but I was worried that if I went to get a soda I would be tempted to buy something else and that would cost me too many calories. I ended up debating with myself for 3 hours about whether or not to get a soda and risk wasting calories that I ran out of time to eat at all and had to leave for school with nothing but a cup of sweet tea to hold me over. I did manage to get a small snack before class started but it wasn't healthy nor was it enough to get me through the day and I ended up skipping my final class of the day so I could go home and get something more substantial. On my way home I gave into hunger and got 2 donuts from dunkin'. Those plus dinner put me over my calorie limit by almost 500 calories. The same thing happened this morning. Nothing I had sounded appetizing and I was too stressed about what I should eat that I didn't eat at all even though I had plenty of healthy options already prepared in my fridge. Luckily my classes will be over earlier today so I wont be going as long without food but I will definitely be craving a snack when I get home. Has anybody else struggled with this and does anybody have any ideas on how I can avoid doing this?,1645120140.0

I have been all kinds of weights (under, healthy, over, obese BMI). I felt and looked my best when I was at my healthier weight. However, I'm currently at my highest weight. In the past (several years ago), I went to a psychologist about my eating issues and she claimed I couldn't have an ED because I ""don't count my calories"" even though I now know that for some eating disorders that is not even a criteria. I don't know what my issue is but it's there. I just want to be a healthy weight and stay there. 


I feel like I'm always giving myself excuses to eat. Feeling sad, angry or bad about myself? Eat. Feeling bored? Eat. I have some leftover dessert from when I was celebrating something? Eat, and because I'm eating dessert I may as well eat other junk too. I also work at a fast food place which does not help but I am hoping to find a new job. I didn't take a ""before"" picture or weigh for comparison, ok I'll just start tomorrow...


Yesterday I was out with my slim friends and just seeing myself in those pictures, it makes me feel awful. 


I'm around 12 stone 5, ideally I'd like to be like 8 and a half stone...which doesn't sound like much but I'm like 4""10 so I'm really short. I also don't know how to calculate my calories I should eat to lose weight. When I lost weight as a teenager it was 1,200 but I don't know if it will be the same as I'm the same height? 

Sometimes I just wish I had someone to talk to about these issues because I feel alone. I feel like I'm always going to be overweight and honestly I feel like even if I do lose weight I'll just gain it all back again which demotivates me a lot.

Could use some advice,2,suos4i,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suos4i/i_seem_to_have_hit_a_wall_with_calorie_counting/,13,"I eat 1500-1600 calories a day and do 30 min home workouts 3-4 times a week. I’ve been doing this for almost 4 months now and so far I’ve lost 7 lbs. For reference I’m 5’5 and currently weigh 147lbs. 

While it’s great that I’ve lost some weight, I’m having trouble with the amount of calories that I’m eating. I feel tired all the time. I’m constantly thinking about food and when my next meal is gonna be. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like it’s starting to lean into unhealthy territory with how often I keep thinking of food. Occasionally I can’t fall asleep because my stomach hurts from growling. I’ve heard that feeling hunger is normal when starting out but it’s been 4 months and it doesn’t seem to be working for me. 

I’ve tried upping amount of protein I eat  to help me feel fuller and also spacing out my meals for later on in the day. It has helped a bit but I still keep feeling tired and hungry, so I tried increasing my calories. I started eating 1800-2000 calories and I felt better. I didn’t feel as tired, I had more energy, my mood was better. I didn’t go to bed feeling hungry. 

But I didn’t lose any weight. I don’t think I’m exercising enough to burn off what I’ve eaten. My weigh has stayed roughly the same though when I was eating 1800-2000 cal. I weighed 147-150lb. I have tried to increase the difficulty of the exercises but I’m still new to this so I’m trying to take things slowly.

I’m not sure how many calories I should eat. On one hand, eating 1500-1600cal helps me lose weight but I’m left feeling tired and hungry all the time. Eating 1800-2000cal makes me feel better physically and mentally but I’m not losing any weight.",1645104388.0

Restarting my journey and looking for advice on my previous attempt.,2,suo63h,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suo63h/restarting_my_journey_and_looking_for_advice_on/,10,"Hi,

I am looking for some advice or tips on weight loss and body fat, but also want to share my story in the past where I am unsure if what I did was wrong and what I did was right in the hope some of you would be able to answer me. EDIT : Should have added, I know an error was going back to old ways.

Currently I am 29 years old and roughly 5'10 and weigh 16stone 7lbs (231 lbs). I am wanting to lose weight (Again) and actually change my appearance, but unsure if my diet and exercise routine is correct. I am wanting to lose weight, but more importantly, body fat. I want to lose the fat from my upper chest but specifically, lower belly fat, but I know you cant target fat loss.

A few years ago, I decided to lose weight and I was 16stone 5lbs and managed to get to 13 stone 5lbs, but I did not notice much change in myself apart from my parents saying my face has definitely changed. All myself noticed was that a T-Shirt that was tight on me, actually felt loose, so I guess I did lose something on my stomach/chest. I did this from roughly Feb-June.

My exercise back then was just on the treadmill doing some form of HIIT. 30seconds walk on 4.5speed roughly and then run for 30seconds on 8.5 speed. I would higher the speed once I got a little fitter, the max my treadmill goes to is 14. I would do 15mins in the morning and then 15mins in the evening or sometimes do 30 in the evening. My stamina is incredibly poor so I cant run for long, I found HIIT kind of helped me and heard it was good. I did no such thing such as weights, push ups, squats etc etc.

My diet back then was pretty basic. I'm a fussy eater so i'm not into a vast amount of foods which is frustrating. My lunch basically was a form of meat and vegetable, my dinner was the same. I drank energy drinks (sugar free) as i'm not that into water or flavoured water, although this time i'm considering getting into it much more.

I also cut out carbs completely such as white bread and potato, apart from on a Saturday where I would have a treat meal. Looking back, I should have ate more than I did but i'm learning about weight loss and diets etc.

So, I am now at the starting point again. I plan to cut out carbs as much as I can or have much less in the week. Cereal for breakfast, soups for lunch and then in the evening have meat and vegetable with maybe a small boiled potato.

Exercise, I plan to do HIIT too but for 1 hour instead of two 15min sessions. But instead of 1 hour of HIIT, It'll likely be 15min HIIT and walking for 45min, unless I can find the energy for extra 5/10/15mins of HIIT. I plan to do this 5 nights out of 7. I did 1 hour the other day and hit 400 calories according to the treadmill, so I guess that was good even though treadmills not 100% accurate on the calorie burnt.

I have a pair of dumbbells 5kg each but i'm not the strongest but I want to try maybe do squats etc. What is the best exercises to do with dumbbells?

I am also looking into exercises on YouTube such as abs/pushups etc but not sure how much they help but I assume they must.

Sorry it's a long post, so yeah. I'm basically wondering what I have done wrong in the past or what am I doing that is right. I'm open to suggestions and tips for me to improve my exercise routines and diet.

Thanks!",1645102538.0
Getting used to not eating the pizza and a lot of acid reflux,3,sunxh4,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sunxh4/getting_used_to_not_eating_the_pizza_and_a_lot_of/,3,"Since starting my weight loss journey (again), I've come to the conclusion that it's easiest to eat at home. Unless it's food where I can easly count calories, like sushi. 

I'm in a lot of meetings where it's ordered pizza or other junk food. In the beginning, I sat there and was sooo hungry. Even when I ate my own food at the same time, I wast really, really hungry. But during the last meetings, I've noticed that I don't even look at the pizza. I know it's there, but I don't get hungry, don't want it. It's almost like it just isn't there. I know there will be dinner at home, and I know I won't die if I don't eat that pizza. It's a great feeling! 

And for valentines, my boyfriend bought a cake. He said ""I know it's a lot of calories, but I figured that since you've been to school and in a meeting after that you hadn't eaten a lot. Maybe one slice can fit within the budget?"" And yes, he was right. I hadn't eaten much, and I ate some cake. It was delicious. The rest of the cake have been staying in the fridge. I see it every dya, but I just don't crave it. Again, it's like it's not there. Also a great feeling! 

However, I've had really bad acid reflux since saturday, and I suspect that's why I don't crave that food. Like, fatty food don't help at all! But I enjoy the ride and hope that I can keep having the rational self-control when this hell ride of an acid reflux stops.",1645101812.0
"In a deficit, but still gaining at same rate as when in surplus.

I was gaining about .75-1 lb a week.

My workouts haven't changed at all, but starting the last week of January, I decided to cut my calories to 2100.

I've been tracking for years, like I have a streak over 1k days on mfp and I'm very experienced in knowing how my body responds, and there used to be things I didn't track (like one single chocolate, or kimchi, pickles, that kind of thing) but it was never an issue and I could predictably control my weight. I never used to weigh fruit like bananas or apples, and I'd just enter them generically, but I've started to weigh them. I weigh coffee creamer. I cut out alcohol.

I also used to be able to start to see the scale go down within days of adjusting diet, and it's just only going up, and at the same rate.

Could this be muscle gain?! I don't necessarily feel like I've added any fat, but I'm confused by the numbers, thoroughly. I honestly don't want to lower my calories any more, nor do I want to get any more neurotic over weighing food.

To Everybody Starting Out,7,suh3zh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/suh3zh/to_everybody_starting_out/,0,"WARNING. Part of this post discusses eating disorders and my personal past trauma.

I would also like to mention that this is not a guideline, these are things that I've learned. Everybody is different and things that worked for me may not work for you and there is nothing wrong with that. With that out of the way here's what I know

About a year ago I actually came to this subreddit for help. It has of course been one year and I'd like to share everything that I've learned along the way. If you're anything like I was when I started out, you probably have no idea where to start. All this talk about calories and diets and exercise programs, it's all so overwhelming.

If you want my advice, throw all of that out the window when you start. The best way to start losing weight is to do something as simple as drinking water instead of a soda or doing two pushups. You will begin to notice yourself doing these things without even trying and it will eventually become a part of your life.

No offense, but you are not accustomed to a serious workout schedule or diet. Every single time I tried to start losing weight I would find some insane diet or workout program and follow that for about a week and then just give up. You are going to need time. You are going to learn what diet works best for you and you're going to find that workout routine over time, it's just not going to be now. Baby steps are absolutely required.

Celebrate every single accomplishment. Even something as small as choosing water over a soda, you know you made the healthier choice and look, you're already on track to becoming the healthier you. I am proud of you and everybody else on this subreddit is proud of you. Keep track of everything that you do and then look back and visualize the changes you did by yourself. Hold yourself up and win by your own terms.

Balance is key. A lot of people will you tell that you need self control but there is two sides to everything. If you were like me, you had an obsessive eating habit and spent a lot of your time ""relaxing"". I can tell you for a fact that if you tried to insert nothing but self control it is NOT going to work. I would recommend for about a month you just do small things like a couple exercises or eating a healthy meal a day. Learning self control is very important but just like losing weight, it takes time. After you get in that habit then try and enforce it into your life a little bit more but remember, you are in this for the long run, there is no need to rush anything.

DO. NOT. GO. THE. EASY. WAY. OUT. About five months before I came to this subreddit for help I was basically starving myself everyday to try and lose some weight, and it worked, for about two weeks. I put all that weight back on so fast and it came back with twice the vengeance. If you take the easy way out you are not going to learn any self discipline and you will find yourself right back to square one very quickly. Remember, you are here for your health, not your looks.

The gym is not as scary as you think it is. After I had gotten accustomed to working out at home and eating healthy-ish, I decided it was time I make that giant leap and buy a gym pass. I remember being so damn scared of what other people will think of me and people staring at me. Guess what? Nobody gives a shit about what you are doing there. 99% of the people you will see at that gym are there to better themselves, not break down other people.

Don't be afraid to ask questions at the gym. This sort of goes with the last one, if you want to try and find some good exercises or tips, don't be afraid to ask around at the gym. Every single person there was you at some point in time. I am currently working on building muscle and every time I come up to somebody and ask them to help me with form or something I could be doing better they are always more than happy to help, just make sure they're not busy.

Find a workout buddy. I started my path to better health with a friend and I honestly must say it helped a ton. Now this doesn't have to be an in-person friend, it can be something like this subreddit, everybody is here to support you and lift you up.

You will find what works best for you. The things I just listed have all worked great for me but that doesn't mean they're all going to work for you. The best you can do is give some a try and see what sticks. You'll eventually find your comfort zone and get in your rhythm, but for now, don't be afraid to spread your wings a little, it won't hurt.

Resting is just as important as exercising. Taking a day to rest from working out is just as important as exercising. Do not overstress your body. Pushing yourself too far especially in the beginning is a great way to lose motivation and give up on losing weight. Always remember to pace yourself

My final piece of advice is not really advice. If you are here, looking for answers then you are right where you need to be. Since coming to this subreddit I have made changes to myself I didn't even think would be possible. I have regained my confidence and I have never felt healthier in my life.

Obviously this isn't a study backed by doctors or a well written essay, this is just a few things I've learned along the way and a few tricks I developed to help me and honestly, I am still learning to this day. Remember, you can reach that goal. It might not be for another two years but you will look back and be so thankful of your past self for making the change. I wish you all good health and the best of luck!

p.s. sorry for the horrible grammar and punctuation. I'm good at exercise not English ;)

\*EDIT\* I also want to mention you cannot target fat. I remember trying for so long to target my hips and stomach just to learn that doesn't really do anything. I've noticed that fat sort of comes off like a popsicle. It doesn't have a pattern and that's why some areas may seem like they're just stuck there. The best thing I can tell you is to just keep going at your pace. I fully believe in you.

\*EDIT 2\* To those of you with eating disorders, I hope you know there is absolutely nothing wrong with it and there is hope. I suffered with anorexia for 15 years of my life and when covid hit and I put on all of the weight I hated myself and I hated how I looked. It breaks my heart to hear some of the stories in this subreddit and to know those people are also feeling what I felt. I just want you all to know that any progress you make is worth feeling proud of and if you ever need to talk or rant to someone whos struggled with something similar I'm always open to private messages.

I meal prep in glass tupperware boxes , mostly chicken chipolata one pan meals with beans, chickpeas and microwave rice (great for chucking in the pan). I freeze these and take them out of the freezer the night before!

The bean and chickpea enhanced diet is too much fiber for me as i also have museli+skyr for breakfast , I would like to hear what you guys do for lunch meal preps, and how you balance it being affordable too.

In the UK you can buy pouches of microwave brown rice which is pretty affordable and convienient but i feel one whole pouch is a bit much for one meal, hence the pan idea (this way i can make a pan divide into 6 meals or so with only two pouches of rice). 

I'm tempted to use those cans of mackerel but they're quite high in calories and too much salt and fat.

Im honestly confused at my weigh ins. I have been eating under 2500 every single day most days 1900  the odd one will hit 2400 but im staying under the recommended 2500 for someone who works out every day.

According to MFP I should be losing near 5 pounds a week (unrealistic) however im at a point where I wonder why im not seeing just 1/2 a pound changes.

For clarity I wish I measured my waist before starting because maybe I am losing inches and don't know it.

I weigh my food and as this has been an experiment for me so I calculate every single calorie I put in my mouth, I never have a cheat day and I stay the course. I don't drink soda or juice, just water and I never eat out.

Is there something going on in my body I cant see? are my fat cells holding on to water keeping the scale from budging?

The only thing I have done since starting counting calories is upping my protein a little and even then it still comes in under my ""recommended"" amount for the day.

I am open to what the science may be here for a lack of change. I am confused and wondering if I weigh myself in two weeks will I magically be down 3 pounds or something? I realize weight loss isn't a straight line. I just felt so defeated this morning and need a pick me up.

Either way hopefully some of you will respond to this with some good information for me, either way I am off to do a workout. Im not stopping the calorie counting just yet and my workouts are a mind clearing experience for me.

Just here to vent really. 

I'm unable to calorie count due to having a history of disordered eating. I am in the ""overweight"" category according to my bmi (currently at 27.5). 

Since the summer I have been making efforts to change my life. I stopped smoking heroin (it was infrequent,  but worrying), stopped taking prescription pills recreational, have reduced my alcohol consumption to once per month (still binging when I do) and have not had any food binges since Christmas. I have also started playing soccer three times a week and am usually pretty active on the weekends with hiking or climbing. It's been a big lifestyle change and I feel good about it! I'm also linked in with mental health and addiction services now.

The only thing is, since the last time I weighted myself (maybe in july) I've actually gone up from a bit of 26 to 27.5! I don't understand it! I eat really healthy and portion control. Due to my history of EDs I have a fairly good idea about calories etc. 

Around the time I was making these changes I was diagnosed with pcos and have been put on bc to control it. I have also upped my ssris. 

I would just like to go down to a bmi of 25. I'm naturally muscley for someone who is AFAB, so I know it's unrealistic to get in the middle without a lot of work. I'm concerned about my increased risk type 2 diabetes, I don't want to have to replace all my clothes and idk I just wanna feel good in my body.

Previous Post: [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sp3wvh/week_1_update_post/)

I've mostly stuck to my diet this week, of consuming around 1500 calories a day, split between 2 meals (1pm - 7pm), with the remainder of the day being a fast.

The week gone, included valentines day, which I didn't diet for,  
Valentines day included about 2500 calories in food, as we dined out, and about 1200 calories in drinks (beer and cocktails).

I got straight back on the diet after this day, we had a good time, so no point trying to restrict calories on these kind of days!

 **Starting Weight** : 246.6LBs  
**Weight Last Week** : 242.2LBs  
**Current Weight** : 239.8LB s 

**Weight Loss this week** : 2.4LBs  
**Weight Loss Total** : 6.8LBs 

**My Thoughts:** V-day may have reduced my weight loss this week by half a pound-ish, I was hoping to lose 3lbs this week, as I know first few weeks or weight loss, are quite rapid, but I've still made good progress. There are no visible differences yet, but in another month or two there hopefully will be.

I am returning to the office at the beginning of next month, in a new job - This will require a bit more prep and planning food-wise, but once I hit 225Lb's, I will be introducing 3 hours of cardio per week (workplace is beside a gym), so hopefully as my weight-loss begins to slow down, It is sped back up with the cardio.

My plan is to ease myself into it, with some fast incline walking in between some short (5mins) periods of a jog, and build myself up that I can do a 35 minute 5k without stopping (this was my previous cardio workout) - I will keep you all posted as I work my way up to this!

My thoughts after 100 days of counting calories,5,sugbqo,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sugbqo/my_thoughts_after_100_days_of_counting_calories/,33,"25F. 5'5. SW:103.5kg. CW:101\~102kg. GW: 70kg

More than 100 days ago, I decided to change.

I started by logging food daily to see where I was at and what were my issues. I mean yeah I was eating more than my maintenance but why? I found out I was not cooking enough, the majority of my meals are store brought, I didn't eat enough vegetables, I didn't move, etc.

I started by cooking more often. Then I added more vegetables, nuts, and seeds (I already ate a huge amount of protein) all while continuing to eat at maintenance. I learned many valuable tricks like meal prepping, skipping breakfast for larger lunches and dinners, cooking in cool and healthy ways. After being comfortable with eating at maintenance, I switched to eating at a deficit of 500 cal.

Then, I added moving more. I am not talking ONLY about exercise, but also the act of staying less seated. To do that, instead of cleaning the whole house twice a week, I cleaned a small part of it daily. Playing with my kids in the park more often, running while they bike. I also commute by foot now. my daily average steps jumped from less than 1000 to 10K STEPS A DAY!!

Finally, I added exercise. I lift weights twice a week and do C25K the other 3 days. I've just finished week 4 of C25K, and for the first time in my adult life, I ran for a total of 16 minutes!

Unfortunately, despite how healthy I've become in all life aspects, I am BARELY losing anything. In fact, all the weight I've lost happened in the first couple of weeks then it stopped and started losing ever so slowly. I only lost \~5lbs after all of this.

I am frustrated. I know I am counting right because the math actually DOES check out. I calculate my weekly predicted loss based on what I've eaten that week vs the actual weight I lost and the error difference. It's pretty accurate and it showed me that I only have an error of unlogged 50 cal daily. This probably comes from seasoning or a small amount of oil while cooking or something. What I am saying is everything checks out I know.

But I am still upset and disappointed. I feel like, after 100 days of being healthy, I should have lost more. I know I can technically make my deficit lower but when I do that, I end up binge eating + feeling like shit the whole day. Last week, I ate at maintenance and was trying to see if I would lose weight by exercising alone. Hint: I didn't

How to move forward? I don't know. 5lbs in 100 days seems like a joke at best. I will continue exercising, moving more, eating healthy, and logging my calories but I will stop eating at a deficit. Instead, I will try other approaches of eating at a deficit that is not ""eat 1500 instead of 2000 daily"". For now, I am thinking about alternative day fasting (ADF). Basically eating at maintenance for a day, then fasting the next 24 hours, and so on. I tried fasting in the past and noticed that not eating at all was actually easier than eating low calories. this will also make my weekly deficit something like if I've done a 500 cal deficit daily so it should work while making me happy.

before you say it's not sustainable once I lost weight. Honestly, I don't think that's an issue. I had no issues counting my calories and sticking to the limit when I was eating at a maintenance. I only get tired when I try to eat very low calories. and eating at 1600\~1700 (my average) is very sustainable but I get frustrated by how slowly I'm losing compared to the efforts I'm putting

I'm sorry if you expected this to be a positive post.

Rant over.

Impulse control is zero. Discipline is zero. All of it. I hate that I can’t make myself stop and think before doing something, like grabbing more food. I know part of it is due to having issues surrounding food from when I was a kid, but I feel like that shouldn’t be an excuse now, especially when it’s basically killing me. 

I have Bipolar, Depression, Anxiety, ADD, along with other things. But it all combines to I just can’t figure out how to stop my brain when it decides it NEEDS something.

Though in the past I already lost some weight with counting calories I always was pretty bitter about the fact that I won't loose weight even if I were in my calculated TDEE. It said I should eat 1600 calories a day but I only saw progress if I stayed within 1300 cal.
Today I used another TDEE website which had an optional field for Bodyfat in %. When I went to the gym in 2020 I weighted myself on a bodyfat scale. Although I was more than ashamed that my bodyfat was over 50% (!) I never thought about the differences it might cause for my TDEE. So today I typed in my old reading of 50% and it said 1300 cal to loose weight. Exactly what I found out by myself!!!
I always knew that muscles burn more calories but I never thought of that!!!

So first thing I did was ordering me a caliper. That realisation also let me think more about sports. I was never the kind of person who liked to do fitness and I also found out that eating less is more effective in losing weight than burning calories so it always was and is a struggle to get myself motivated to move. But to be honest, knowing that I can eat more if I had less bodyfat motivates me more than the thought of a fit body (although that would be awesome too!). A few years ago I already had a good routine with the Bikini Body Challenge by Kyla Itsines and I felt pretty good that days.

So my goal is to measure my current body fat again and work hard to loose some fat, otherwise I were only allowed to eat under 1300 to maintain my weight once I hit my goal weight. And it's hard enough to it so less to loose weight.",1645098932.0

Three days, if I don't use dressing (people were telling me it should last longer, but alas...). So I'm doing a batch about every few days, about 3-4 kilos (6-8lbs) for the both of us.

One thing I'm struggling is coming up with combinations, though, but it may be down to the current season, a lot of stuff is just kind of hard to get in any decent shape at a decent price.

In the meantime I don’t want to do nothing at all. Give me your favorite habits for weight loss! My goal is to incorporate 1 to 3 for the next 30 days or so.,1645048469.0
When do you actually start losing fat after water weight?,0,sujqoy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sujqoy/when_do_you_actually_start_losing_fat_after_water/,21,"Every time I eat at a deficit, I lose water weight up to 2 kilos but after that, I do not lose despite the deficit.

Essentially my losses are getting a lot smaller and less frequent and I don't want to encourage myself to eat even lower calories or work out more so I've decided it might be time for my first diet break for maybe a week or so.

However I'm not exactly sure how to go about it as eating the additional 500 or so calories daily seems impossible now, I'm pretty satisfied with my defecit calories. I can't really fathom eating that much more and the thought of it makes me sick. I could see myself going for an additional 300 and get in some more snacks or a sandwich etc.

Would this be enough of a change to make a difference and help kickstart things again or am I going to have to find a way to get in the extra calories?",1645082080.0

I lost less than one pound per month for one year…and I’m thrilled!,1626,st3w8t,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/st3w8t/i_lost_less_than_one_pound_per_month_for_one/,77,"**tl;dr numbers:**

**Height**: 5’3” (162 cm)

---

Disclaimer: I know that I didn’t “need” to lose weight. My start weight might be someone’s goal weight, and people at that do not need to aim lower.

For me, a few years ago, I gained 10 lbs pretty quickly (within ~5 months) after being roughly the same weight my whole life. Because I wasn’t used to it, and I didn’t fit into some of my old clothes, I wanted to slim down just a bit, back to my baseline.
   
---

On February 15th 2021, I weighed 134 lbs. (~60.5 kg). My goal was to lose 10 lbs. (~4.5 kg), and I hoped to lose 0.5 lbs. (~0.2 kg) per week. I thought that was reasonable – not too restrictive! – and I could be done in about 5 months.

Today, on February 15th, 2022, I just weighed in at 123.5 lbs., meaning that for the last year, I’ve lost on average….less than one pound per month. Much slower than even my “slow and reasonable” plan!

HOWEVER! In the end, I have no regrets at all about taking this long. Here’s why:

**1) I didn’t count calories for the past few months, and for me, this is a win.**

I respect calorie counting and I know people who will happily do it forever, but I personally wanted to learn to live without. Right after I gained the weight a few years back, I did 20-4 intermittent fasting + strict calorie counting and I lost weight quickly…but I kind of slipped into obsessive territory (I thought about food CONSTANTLY, and once panicked that I ate “too much” *on my birthday*, what?). Plus, it wasn’t sustainable. I gained it all back.

This time, I wanted to do it differently. Calorie counting in the first month or so was good to learn what meals “work for my life”. But I stopped quickly - partially due to laziness, if I’m honest - and now, I don’t need to spend the time measuring my ingredients or painstakingly entering recipes into MyFitnessPal.

**2) Losing over a year taught me to be okay with fluctuation.**

Even though I lost a little under 1 lb a month *on average*, my actual trajectory was more like:

Lose -> Plateau -> Lose -> Gain -> Lose -> Plateau -> Lose -> (etc.)

Once, I plateaued around 126 lbs for a month, then I lost a pound, and then saw my weight creep back up to 128, before I finally found the motivation to start losing again.

What this taught me is that weight loss - even slow weight loss - can sometimes be very mentally tough, and sometimes, I don’t have it in me to put in the effort. In those times, it’s okay to just maintain or even gain some weight. I can be kind and patient with myself. Putting things on pause is not “giving up” – I just have to have faith that the desire and motivation will come again. And **for me**, it always eventually did.

**3) I learned things about my body.** 

Personally, I am so ravenously hungry before my period that I can’t lose weight, because I eat a lot more than usual. AND I bloat up the day before my period, which sometimes makes it seem like I’ve “gained it all back”. But after my period starts, there are like two weeks where I get full very easily. I have no idea why, but it’s a pattern I noticed.

So I learned to work around this. After my period, I take advantage of my lack of hunger and eat less; then, in the leadup to my period, I eat at maintenance or a little above it. I don’t lose weight during those weeks; but over the course of a month, I still end up losing. It’s one step back, but two steps forward.

---

One year sounds like a lot of time, but I’m going to be honest - a year ago doesn’t feel that long ago to me? Or rather: the time felt like it passed by very quickly, because I was doing other things: seeing friends, playing video games, catching up on Succession, working (and looking for a new job HAHA), hiking, trying to learn to draw. As wiser people than me have said - the time passes anyway. And even if it was slow, I think the extra time was well spent for me.

Hi everyone! Lurker here that is finally posting. I just turned 29 last week and decided that I need to start getting my life together, mentally, physically, spiritually, everything basically. I've also learned that the secret to surviving adulthood is that no one ever has their life all put together and we're all making this up as we go along. But I can do what I can to make this journey as fun and healthy as possible. 

I'm going out on a limb here and asking for people to keep me accountable. At least on the health part (though I wouldn't turn any of the rest down either). I am 224 lbs as of this morning. Diabetes, heart problems, cholesterol problems, blood pressure problems.... they all run in my family pretty strongly. I started to lose weight last year, fell off the wagon and gained back and extra 10 lbs on top of what I had lost. I'm wanting to go about it a little slower this time and give myself a lot more grace. 

So far I've been trying to drink a lot more water and avoid soda unless it's zero sugar. I've been trying to get better about packing snacks instead of relying on Sheetz (local gas station) because that always ends up with me buying chips and candy and soda. I'm trying to work with my husband on including more veggies into dinner (he does most of the cooking because of work schedules).

I know I need to start exercising but I can't seem to find the motivation for that...hopefully the exercise fairy can come and help? Lol",1645038137.0

The Return Journey,16,stw89x,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stw89x/the_return_journey/,2,"All of my life I was overweight. I was constantly overactive with sports and weight lifting, but still ate my emotions, partook in binge eating, and didn't listen to anything other than ""fatlogic."" 

It wasn't until I was 23 when my 6' 1"" frame ballooned up to 245, that I realized something was wrong. Also, I got my first cholesterol test back, and the results were more than concerning. Taking my family history of heart disease into account, the results were severely problematic. 

Over the course of the next year, I dropped from 245 to 180. I was flying high. I moved across country, made new friends, was living in a place, both mentally and physically, full of nothing but bliss. It was like I let go of all that shame, doubt, and misbelief, and the person who I truly was, came forth. It was so liberating. 

Fast forward to present day, I just turned 28 a few days ago. I am now 217, drink too much alcohol, stress eat, and I even was turned back towards fat logic by a mental health professional, who I don't see anymore for more reasons than that. 

Equipped with experience, history, and a strong support system, I am embarking on what I am calling The Return Journey. Not just to my ideal weight, but back to reason, and back to health. 

I started on my birthday,  February 14th, and weighed in at 217 pounds. 

Today on February 16rh, I woke up and weighed in at 210.4 pounds. I know it's mostly water weight, but calorie counting and a balanced diet which doesn't include so much alcohol has already put a 7 pound dent in my goal. I'm proud of it. 

This will be a journey of self forgiveness and love. I am going to care of myself. Wish me luck!",1645019036.0

Community, I hope you are all doing well and prospering.

I have been a silent reader on this sub for some time, and any time I had a question or was struggling was something, the search bar has helped me tremulously. Thank you all because I have learned so much in the past few months simply by reading about your individual journey's.

I just created an account because, after two months of dieting and exercise, I have hit a hurdle and wanted to see if anyone had any comments/feedback.

**Background**:

I am 37 F and (*edit: to include height, 5 ft 5*) 40lbs overweight. I have lost a good amount of weight so far by eating my doctor's recommended 1,200kcal a day. I have incorporated exercise 5 days a week. A mix of cardio and light strength workouts.

I have a sweet tooth and previously due to not understanding how to diet properly I had a binge eating disorder, but that was resolved in a matter of months after I learned that eating one light meal a day was the cause of that.

This time around, I felt informed and happy to take things steady. The 1,200 can feel a little restrictive sometimes due to my diet not being high protein, but for the most part, weight has been coming off and I've felt fine. I gave myself one day a week where I can order a junk meal and incorporate sweets into my daily diet so I could ensure I wasn't feeling deprived or miserable.

I thought I finally figured this whole weight loss thing out and was on my way.

**Problem:**

Yesterday happened. The day before yesterday I had my weekly junk meal but ordered milkshake this time round, which put me at around 2,500kcal. It was not maintenance, but I felt okay because that's life and I preferred doing that than restricting and later possibly bingeing,

However, yesterday reminded me of my old bingeing days. I have no idea what was causing extreme hunger but one slice of cake wasn't enough, one sweet wasn't enough, I felt a craving that wasnt normal. I almost eat up to 3,000 calories. Combine that with the day before, I couldn't help but feel, I have messed up my diet.

*Today:* I am back on track today. I am determined to keep going and have already got back up and continued my day and getting ready to do my exercise right now. This is huge for me. The old me would have felt so defeated.

*However, I am very concerned that this might happen again. I want to try to figure out what caused this so I can minimize this going further. Does anyone know what caused this?  Yesterday felt like the diet was restricting and suppressing my appetite, and my body just gave up.* I still have weight to lose. I want to get to my goal in a healthy way both physically and emotionally. Things have been going so well on the 1,200 diet but I am questioning if this is a little too restrictive. It's felt a little restrictive, but nothing close to starvation or extreme diet.",1645055368.0

Losing weight is always such a struggle... I'm physically weak and I hurt all the time even when I'm not exercising and many exercises I'm either not physically able to do or it's very painful on my joints. PCOS affects my metabolism and makes losing weight very hard and gaining weight very easy. Both my autoimmune diseases and my bipolar require medication that makes you gain a lot of weight and give you the feeling of being lethargic and hungry all the time. Being majorly depressed takes out all the motivation and being manic makes me not care about weight at all, not to mention the wild and unhealthy eating habits that come with both of those states of mind. My kids and my husband also make things hard because they eat differently than me and cooking two meals is just not something I ever want to do. They also make exercising extremely difficult. 


I just have so many hurdles ahead of me and I don't want to be overweight anymore. This is the heaviest I've ever been and I am extremely uncomfortable. Before I had kids the largest I ever got was 165.... this is just so much and it feels like a lot of weight over 4 years.  I tried to talk to my doctors about it but they all say I ""need to treat my other problems first and weight loss may come with progress on those issues"" I just feel like that's not working I'm always going to be bipolar I'm always going have PCOS and lupus and RA and I'm always going to have to take these medications! It just doesn't make any sense. I need help. 

I just hate that I have this huge uphill battle with all these obstacles that seem impossible to overcome.

Starting info: female, pushing 30, currently 185lbs

Background info: I've been in great shape my entire life. Varsity sports, active lifestyle, worked very labour intense jobs....etc. Always hovered around 125-130lbs, looked fit, felt STRONG. Never set foot in a gym because I didn't need it. My diet was okay, could definitely be improved but I was burning so many calories I never had physical evidence to be concerned about what I ate. 


Current day: I've graduated post secondary school, have a full time desk job, and the lack of caring for myself has really started to hit. In the past 4 years I gained a LOT of weight (hit 210 at my max), lost my muscle mass, had some major injuries, and let my diet go to shit. My mental health has steadily declined and I recently hit my rock bottom.


With the support of my partner, I am quitting my job and taking a 2 month 'sabbatical' to get myself back together. My career field has lots of opportunities for outdoor laborious work that I want to do but need to get my body in shape again to be able to do that work well. 



Long story short: I'm about to have time on my hands to eat right, get fit, do some hobbies, and fall in love with my life again. Only problem is, I have no idea how to do that. I'm very new to having to intentionally put work into being fit. My cardio is trash, my body doesn't move the way it used to (from both weight gain and lack of activity) and I don't know where to start. I've had issues in my younger years with obsessive eating had focusing too much on my weight and I'm working on that not happening again. I'm hoping to lose SOME weight, but the main focus is feeling fit enough to carry 60lbs on my back all day hiking around. 


My current plan so far is:

- Make all meals at home, tracking ingredients, and aiming for 1500-1800 calories a day. Setting hard restriction goals feels too much to start so the focus is just eating healthier amounts of healthier ingredients

- hit the gym for strength training 3 days a week to build a healthy routine that is sustainable once I start a new job 

- doing a morning 20min yoga/stretching routine to start the day moving my body 

- on non-gym days, hit some local hiking trails for an hour long walk, starting on easy terrain and working towards more difficult areas and eventually weighted pack walks. 

- once I get comfortable moving and getting stronger, doing more functional activities like splitting firewood


I feel ready and motivated to commit to this and finally have the chance to better myself but also feel like the noob on the block. Does anyone have any critiques for my plan? Is whole body training better than isolated days? How hard can I push myself without being too hard? My previous injuries are now fully recovered so no concerns about them, just need to rebuild the strength lost. I looked at the personal training option at my gym but it is an absolute joke. They asked me immediately how much weight I want to lose and deadass said this could be my ""skinny girl summer"". I don't want to be skinny. I want to cut down a tree without being gassed.

Things like eating a small serving of fries or going to ramen were causing me huge set backs and it just was not normal. 

I told a friend, who was alarmed at how low my daily calorie intake was and how little weight I was losing, and only gaining. She recommended me to get on a reverse diet, slowly up-ing my calories each week to get back to a normal intake point. I incorporated only healthy, high protein foods in my diet - Greek yogurt, almond butter, oats, low carb wheat wraps. 

Well, this totally backfired on me. In 3 months, I gained 20 lbs that I had lost back. It was crazy to me that normal food that my roommates would eat would cause me to gain so much weight. I als

For the past month or so, I’ve tried to get back to a low carb, low cal meal plan, but the scale has not dropped a lick. I am really at a loss now. I have a feeling that my body does not react well to gluten and that the PCOS I thought I’d once shaken has come back full throttle. The weight has set in my belly, thighs and my face has gotten so chunky. 

Does anyone have any tips for conquering this issue? I’m really not even sure what my next steps COULD be at this point. Am I going to have to eat 600 calories a day forever? I do not feel healthy right now and am sluggish, and want to do whatever I can to get back to my old size, lifestyle & the way I used to feel!",1645060126.0
How to gain muscle while slimming down?,1,subpr0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/subpr0/how_to_gain_muscle_while_slimming_down/,8,"Pretty much what the title says! I lost about 25 lbs during the pandemic but slowly lost interest and sort of plateaued. I am about 20 (?) lbs from where I think I should be. I want to put on more muscle, and look strong but I also want to slim down the fat in my stomach. I don’t like weighing myself because it usually leads to negative thought but I’m just curious as to how I should be eating/what workouts I should be doing. I am upping my protein intake but I’m not sure if I should stay in a deficit to slim down or what I should be doing.

8 pounds and cholesterol is down!,63,stkajl,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stkajl/8_pounds_and_cholesterol_is_down/,2,"Hi everyone!

I have been in this journey for a while. During Fall 2021 I gained around 10 pounds, it was due to me over estimating my burned calories. I gave myself free reign and started gaining weight again and when I went to my doctor's checkup my Cholesterol was on the verge of High (224 total). I fear this since my dad has struggled with high cholesterol and got two stents at 50!

I decided to look back onto my habits and food, but couldn't really stick to it until January (Thanksgiving and Christmas after all). I tracked for a couple weeks and noticed that despite me eating around 1600 calories a day, I would always have 1 or 2 days where I was indulging in pizza or burgers that were eventually putting me in a 500-1000 surplus. Which also explained my lack of money!!

I decided to reduce Dairy, Fried food and replaced it with non-dairy alternatives + steamed stuff, and I have been trying to reach 200+ minutes of physical activity each week, as well as eating 1400-1500 hundred calories.

I started building up each week, from 50 minutes until 200+, I currently average around 230-250 per week, which is around the reccommended time to prevent heart disease.

Today I went back to my doctor's and my cholesterol is almost back in the healthy range! (total 200), I decreased my LDL and upped my HDL, which really makes me proud. I have lost around 8 out of the 10 pounds I gained, although I am still not at my goal weight. (another 10 to go)

Its nice to see results, and to feel good about them! Yay!",1644977820.0

I’ve been purposefully losing weight since December. On average, I’ve lost 2-2.5 pounds a week, pretty steady going. 

However, when I weighed myself today (I only do weekly weigh-ins, for my mental sanity) I saw that I had lost about 6 pounds since last Wednesday. Tried multiple times, then tried the scale at work later in the day, all showed the same weight, and I’m not really sure how that is possible.

Funnily, I was expecting a smaller loss (or even a gain!) because Sunday I definitely ate super unhealthy and over maintenance (waffle and bacon, huge plate of nachos, cheeseburger for dinner, and multiple regular calorie sodas).",1645059001.0

Financial stability is changing the way I interact with food.,177,stbjyr,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stbjyr/financial_stability_is_changing_the_way_i/,24,"I have always finished my food. Always. Over the last six months since I got a good job, I’ve been noticing a change I couldn’t have anticipated. Right now, literally right this moment, I’m eating something that wouldn’t reheat well at all. I am full though so I’m going to stop eating it. Will I feel bad throwing out this food? Yes. I hate waste and it doesn’t matter if it’s only a few mouthfuls, it still bothers me. I wish I had chosen the correct portion before I started eating. But will I worry about *wasting money*? For the first time in my life, no. 

I have enough money to buy the amount of food I need and I don’t have to question that fact. I realize this was something I questioned for years, so much so that hunger defines parts of my life. I also felt guilt and resentment over having to spend money on food, especially when I was depressed AND broke. It never got as horrible as a lot of the stories you hear about extreme poverty but apparently it got bad enough to effect the way I think about what I eat. 

I know it comes down to move more, eat less at the end of the day but y’all, there are so many factors at play here. There’s a lot of life experience to unpack to actually figure out what a healthy habit is. I’ve done some of the work but some of it? I’m not sure I could have sorted out when I was struggling with financial instability. Not that it’s impossible - not at all. Sometimes being broke helps you lose weight because god knows you’re not going to be spending your rent on takeaway lol. But like also, be gentle with yourself if you fuck up? Because it’s not as simple as it seems, sometimes?

So yeah. Just something I’ve been thinking about that I thought I’d share and see what folks thought about it.",1644954501.0

On most days like today I don't even eat 2,000. Today I only ate right over 1500. Is this too extreme of a deficit? I'm not starving I'm eating a lot just different food that is lower calorie. Are there risks to such a large deficit? Do you think the tdee calculators and fitbit are overcalculating calories out? I would love some feedback this is weighing on my mind.",1645055262.0
"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 16, 2022",11,stt81n,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stt81n/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_16_2022/,4,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

I know that weight loss is a calories thing and not exercise.But the thing is, exercise for me helped greatly with cravings control.

Everything is being accounted for in mfp and I'm still around my calorie deficit goal but it's still a little disheartening to log in those foods.

First time under 200 pounds in 4 years,196,st9zid,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/st9zid/first_time_under_200_pounds_in_4_years/,17,"This morning I weighed in at 198.0 pounds 22 pounds less than my starting weight of 220. I have spent the last 4 years yo-yo dieting but on December 27th I decided to try again to lose weight. I don’t have anyone to share this with in my daily life because I’m still not comfortable with telling my friends and family about my weight loss journey. I know they’ll support me but I just have a lot of trauma around that. 

I’ve lost the weight doing a combo of OMAD (1-2 times a week) and IF (16:8 or 18:6) the rest of the week. I just listen to my body and if I’m hungry I’ll grab a meal is why I don’t really have a strict eating window. 

I haven’t cut out anything except dairy. I’m lactose intolerant so it was about time 😂. 

The first 12 pounds flew off quick. I lost that in my first 2 weeks. The next 10 pounds took 5 weeks so I’m losing about 2 pounds a week now. I added in strength training 3-4 times a week and I walk about 7000 steps a day on an average week which is a lot more than I did last year. I eat anywhere from 1400 - 2000 calories a day. Whenever I track my calories I account for a 20% margin of error. So if I track 1600 calories for a day, I write it down as 1920 calories for that day. 

My goal weight is 145 pounds. 53 pounds left to go. Wish me luck.

I'll include the ingredients list, nutritional information along with other hints. Some recipes are vegetarian/vegan, others not so much.

Post your favourite healthy recipes here to share with the rest of the loseit community! Recipes don't have to fit this week's theme at all, they should just be something that you can eat reasonably frequently while actively losing weight.

Due to the spirit of the sub, please try to include the calorie and nutritional information if at all possible. MyFitnessPal has awesome recipe calculators you can use!

For the most part, I target my meals to have a component in the 350-550 kcal range. My breakfast and lunch tend to be right around 400 kcal each and dinner can be a bit heavier, or include a side dish to bring the calories up a bit. When I was eating 1650 kcal/day the breakdown was roughly 400/400/600/250 for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks.

Anyhow: enough background on to the recipes!

**Pantry Cleanout**

We had way too many potatoes and onions around the house this weekend so we decided to use them up. Rösti (Swiss hash browns) and Pork chops with onions on Sunday.

https://www.thechunkychef.com/one-pan-french-onion-smothered-pork-chops/

- 4 boneless pork chops [760 kcal]
- 4 slices provolone cheese [400 kcal]
- 1 cup shredded gruyere cheese or swiss [440 kcal]
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter [360 kcal]
- 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil [120 kcal] 
- 1 cup plus 4 Tbsp beef stock [50 kcal] 
- 2-3 onions [100 kcal]
- 2 ½ Tbsp all purpose flour [90 kcal]
- ½ tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- ¼ tsp garlic powder
- fresh thyme sprigs

Total 2320 kcal 4 servings = 560 kcal/serving.

Want to make it lighter? I don’t recommend cutting back the butter, instead cut back the cheese a bit. I omitted the provolone and just used 1 cup of shredded Jarlsberg  to remove about 100 kcal.

We served it with some boiled baby potatoes too. 4 potatoes ~ 100 kcal. So net-net still around 600 kcal.

I know I should be delighted and happy with my circumstances, and I'm aware of how privileged I am, but I can't help but feel nervous and guilty about these experiences I should be embracing. I wish I could enjoy holidays and nights out without over indulging and sabotaging the efforts I'm making to get back to my goal weight.

It seems everyone is talking about the pandemic weight that they're losing now, and I'm just gaining post-pandemic weight.

Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?",1645050622.0

Gained a few pounds back and trying to get back to the progress I was getting before. Unfortunately my cravings got the best of me and it's pretty difficult to stick to the specific diet I had before. Trying to exercise is an even bigger task considering I'm pretty depressed. It's scary too because i lost so much weight and was doing at least somewhat okay with fitness just to have it took away from me. On top of ppl knowing how much i lost .. weight wise it's a lot of pressure. Idk. Just posting here to see if anyone has advice to give and just to get a little support ngl. How do I get out of this rut even though i barely have motivation to do anything ? I feel like a failure as a person and I've started to think my fitness journey was at least one of the few things that could help me at least think a person could like one thing about me. It gave me a feeling of accomplishment which is great for me anyways.. but now it seems like I'm going back to old habits and I want to stop it before it gets completely out of control,1645050149.0

This week has been a doozy, not only with Super Bowl and Valentine’s Day, but I also said “yes to the dress” — leading to *a lot* of social, celebratory FEASTING. Honestly, awesome week for that.

However, I’ve been diligently tracking calories and feeling discouraged by the multiple high calorie days. But then I realized... I ate up my would-be deficit. Not perfect when you’re trying to lose, but I simply maintained this week without that being the goal.

I’m delighted that the small decisions I made throughout this week added up to something positive. I walked a lot most days, I drank only tea and water (exception of a Valentine’s cocktail and Super Bowl soda), I had binge evenings but only on low-cal foods, I limited high calorie indulgences to one meal.

It wasn’t a perfect week, but it was a good one. Good enough will also get me (slowly) to my goals, I’ve realized. After a week like this I would have given up.

Adding those up together tells me that my maintenance calories over 23 days is 81,231 or around 3500 a day, which is different than what I found online.

Is my math off somewhere, or is there something else I'm not factoring into the equation? Or is 23 days simply not a large enough sample size?

Edit: I used lightly active when using the TDEE calculators, which I still think is correct. I'll go to the gym a maximum of 3 times a week, and my non-gym physical activities include walking a 1 mile round trip to the grocery store a few days a week and cleaning around my apartment.",1645022108.0

I apologize if this isn't the place or if my rant is unwarranted, I didn't know where else to go.

In the beginning of 2020, I weighed over 125kg and realized that I was under risk of hypertension and possible diabetes, and I began trying to slowly fix this myself. I walked 2k a day, then upped it to 5 and even 6. I ate healthy, I completely avoided processed garbage but I didn't go cold turkey and ate reasonably, allowing myself to have some junk every now and then. In the span of 6 months, I lost over 15 kilos. I began fitting into shirts a size smaller and even looked completely different. 

In August of 2020, I had an accident that disabled use of my left hand for a few months, but that weirdly had nothing to do with the spiral I was about to fall into. Or maybe it did, because I kept telling myself that I was in a great deal of discomfort and pain, and that treating myself at a time like this would be fine. 

And so it began, the slow pile up of chips, sodas, chocolates and all the other ""good"" stuff. I ate nearly twice the calories I used to eat, I stopped eating my own food almost entirely and ate out 6 days of the week. When the second wave of COVID struck, I wasn't as arsed as I was last time: I continued down the path of no fucks given, I pigged out almost every single day and I had a mixed feeling of regret and contentment. The fact that I quit my job in May because I wasn't being paid didn't help the situation at all. 

It took me till August to find another job, but the binge has not stopped since late 2020. I've now outgrown the weight I wanted to lose, going from 125kg to 110 to 130 now, and I'm fucking tired, but I want to change. I tried logging calories at least a dozen times since then, and my longest streak was 3 weeks. I have no idea what my future is, with chest pains, random GERD issues and whatnot. 

If you've read till here, I love you and thank you for reading these silent cries. I don't know what to do, but I'll at least try and listen to any advice you lovely folks have. I very likely need actual therapy more than anything, and I haven't been able to get myself to go there even though I want to. So any other advice would really be appreciated.",1645040886.0

I am 25 YOE with no existing conditions. I was always fat but WFH during pandemic and frequent takeout made me obese. At max, I weighted 112 kgs. So, as a part of my new year's resolution, I decided to lose weight and created a plan that I strictly followed:

&#x200B;

Diet plan:

Breakfast 1: 2 Fruits + 1 glass of  milk (300 cal)

Breakfast 2: Combination of (fruits, greek yogurt, kombucha/lemonade, boiled eggs, cheese slices, potato chips)  (500 cal)

Dinner: Rice with some curry or cheese omlette with noodles (900 cal)

Total: 1700 (except for cheat day once a week where I get around 2500 cal)

Gym:

60 mins of cardio (-450 cal, 6 days a week)

&#x200B;

The routine was tiring. I get terrible cravings and am often moody. Also, my legs always hurt.

On the plus side, the results so far are pretty great. I have lost 7 kgs in last 2 months (I plan to lose 20 kgs more) and reduced my waist my 2 inches. Also, I have noticeable calf muscles.

I weight myself every 3 days at the gym. And until now I was always losing weight (except for rest day, where I gained some weight but I believe that would be due to muscle buildup and water retention). However, in the past 3 days for the first time I have gained 0.5-0.7 kgs. What should be the reason behind it? Should I make any changes in my diet (I hope not) or workout?

I am really worried. This routine is hard enough and the only thing that keeps me going is seeing consistent results. But, now I am gaining weight inspite of taking all these precautions.",1645038634.0

Being accountable to myself alone just isn't enough of a motivator....if it was, I would have lost all the weight a REALLY long time ago.  Since my boyfriend doesn't really care what my weight is, I'm not close with family, and I have next to no friends (on purpose, it's an anxiety thing, don't judge), and Reddit is my only social media outlet, I decided to be accountable to all of you.

So, my pledge:

I pledge to all of you to lose between 30 - 40 pounds (keeping health and safety in mind at all times) between now and June 21 (first day of summer), at which time I will maintain that weight throughout the summer months.  On September 1 (technically not the end of summer, but in East Coast Canada it's pretty much the end of summer) I will again lose more weight to reach my goal of 145 by Christmas.

I think this is doable, right?  30 - 40 pounds in 4 months should bring me down to around 160, then I have 3 months to lose the remaining 20 - 30 pounds.

EDIT:  Thanks to all those who expressed support!  For the naysayers, this isn't my first time dieting (I lost about 130lbs in my mid-30s with the help of a personal trainer). I know the goal is high, but  I'm not forcing anyone else to set the same goal as me.  If I go to low and say ""only 5lbs a month"", as most of you seem to want me to say, then I won't put in the effort and slack too much.  I'm saying between 5lbs and 10lbs a month.  That's good wiggle room for me.  Trust me, I know myself quite well.  If I don't reach the goal, that's totally okay with me.  No one is holding a gun to my head on this.  I know my brain, I know my body.  And for those asking, my diet is calorie counting, low carb (not necessarily Keto, but being mindful of my carb intake), and 5 - 6 days of exercise. My favourite workouts are low impact HIIT as I have bad knees from previously doing high impact HIIT.",1644949773.0
"Here is my story, please help me adjust my diet to my excersize",1,stzohx,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stzohx/here_is_my_story_please_help_me_adjust_my_diet_to/,2,"Dear Members,

I'm a male in my 30s, 185cm tall. I was a fat kid, at age 15 my weight peaked at 152kg. I was obese in a way that fat accumulated all over my body parts, not just belly.

I get my act together and by age 19 I was 103kg, so around 50kg loss over 5 years. It was so much better. But I just cannot lose a large amount of hanging fat, from my belly, thighs, upper arms and chest area, you can imagine. I never went for surgery.

I was quite muscular under the fat and it showned, I did kettlebell training and other weight lifting.

In recent years, with carb and sugar min diet, and with cardio excersise I lost more weight, I reached 94 kg. I really enjoyed that, around 90kg is ideal for my weight. But it was strange because I was not muscular anymore, I lost a lot of muscle mass with diet and cardio. Also a lot of fat, I was lean and in clothes I was looking stunning. But looking naked, I was a thin man with lots of remaining fat still, it was a strange sight. I think that was the point where I should go for a tummy tuck and excess skin removal surgary, but I didnt had the money.

Anyways, covid came and I gained 20kg over 2 years. Now I started my weight loss journey 2 weeks ago from 115kg.

I turn to this community to help me adjust my diet and excersize to my goals. I wish to make my fat cells smaller (I know losing them is only possible by surgery and lypo) around all my body, especially around the belly area. I wish to be more muscular. With my current lifestyle cardio is not really and option but I can lift weights and do training at home.

2 weeks ago I started with this program:

\- Daily excersize: around 45-60mins Kettlebell excersizes (very good for me, all around body shaping), doing swings and snatches and the such. I do this at very random times, but every day since 2 weeks.

\- Diet: 1 hot meal a day which is lunch, afternoon time. I mostly eat meat with vegetables, various kinds of meat not just chicken (some fatty meat as well) and raw veggies. In the morning I only drink water, some orange juice, and I and fruits (grapefruit and orange). In the evening I mostly repeat my breakfast, I only eat these fruit (not too much), and drink water and orange juice. 

So I don't eat snacks, I don't drink coffee and don't consume any added sugar. I know there is sugar in the orange juice and in the fruits, but I like them so much and I need them in the morning to wake up.

Over this weeks I lost 3 kgs, I'm now at 112kg. This doesn't seems much but my body is transforming I can see it in the mirror. I'm more muscular, have better form. I think my body transforms fat to muscle. But I want to weight less still, want to reach at least 100kg. I think thats a good goal for me with a muscular stance as I was 94 when I was very thin and no significant muscle mass.

But it seems that now I stuck at 112 kg. I worry that my diet is not working. I should eat more smaller meals? I dont know. This works for me very well and I have energy to do the excersize, but I want to progress with my weight loss and want to optimize my program.

What do you think? What should I do differently?",1645028045.0

My weight has yoyoed over the years but has been gradually creeping. 2021 was the first year that I can remember where I ended less than I started, but it has been a massive struggle until recently. 

After working with my Dr over the past few years around this, she recommended I try Ozempic to get my weight loss moving along as by that stage I had lost around 7kg (15lb). This was in mid-December 2021. Since then (2 months) I've lost a further 8kg and am feeling great! The biggest thing for me is that it actually takes very little willpower (arguably none) as I just can't eat much. My portion sizes have gone down 75% from what they used to be and I'm rarely hungry. I feel like how I think normal people do with food where you eat and then at a point get full and not constantly craving more and serving sizes being so much larger than other people.

At one stage I felt like I was cheating my weight loss journey, but this isn't a competition I'm trying to win, this is about my health and I don't want to be in a constant battle with food. I love food and don't want to feel guilty every time I sit down to eat and constantly fight with my appetite when I diet which destroys my willpower.

I'm not suggesting this medication or any medication to others, but it sure is working well for me and I finally believe that I will be able to get down to my goal weight again and I can't wait to see my scale to drop below 100kg (220lb) for the first time in about 8 years.",1644974970.0

I only have a mother, my mother is kind but she's physically disabled in some ways and visually disabled a bit as well, she is unable to properly make meals consistently so it's often takeout or random stuff from the corner shop, I have not had a consistent and healthy 3 proper meals a day in many years.

It does not help that I have asthma as well, I presume I have ADHD or even mild autism but it has not been diagnosed as I have not had any form of mental check-up in ages, though I was meant to a couple months ago.

I do go outside a decent bit when I am able to as I do like wildlife, but due to living in the middle of the city, there's not a lot of opportunities for this, if I lived closer to nature I would probably go for walks much more often.

Anyone know about this magical spreadsheet?,18,st6x6b,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/st6x6b/anyone_know_about_this_magical_spreadsheet/,32,"Does anyone know about this?

Around 2012/2013 an old boyfriend found me this amazing spreadsheet on reddit which laid out exactly how many calories I needed to eat per week in order to reach a specific weight goal (each week it was a slightly larger number of calories).  It was like magic!  It was the first time I was able to set a weight goal, achieve it and my metabolism maintained it.  Almost 10 years and 2 kids later I'm so needing this again.  Looking for a miracle:  does anyone have access/knowledge of something like this?

addicted to fast food,5,stfaql,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stfaql/addicted_to_fast_food/,7,"I’m (F,21,5’5) around 11 stone at the moment, while my ideal would be 9. 

For several years I have bounced between 9-11 stone, because of my addiction to fast food, and it makes me feel extremely hopeless and angry at myself. It makes me feel like any progress I make is only temporary.

I get such a dopamine rush from the ordering, the waiting, getting to eat hot food immediately while feeling that I’m ‘treating’ myself. Love the salt and sugar. afterwards I feel like shit and feel ashamed of the boxes. I rarely order more than once a week but I order more than I should when I do. Because I work a 9-5 and work from home ( I live alone) when I’m not spending time with my partner ( who works 9-5 at a school) or with friends ( who also work) I’m by myself. so the food is definitely more about comfort and loneliness I think more than anything else. I want to go out to events and make new friends and even be confident enough to just do things by myself but I get anxious, especially as I now feel self conscious about my weight. I enjoy healthy food and I’m not a bad cook, it’s just the mental aspect of finishing work each day to cook from scratch for one person, it feels like a lot of work for little reward. But maybe that is just a symptom of me not caring enough for myself to do what’s right and good instead of what’s comfortable.

I am currently seeing a therapist and in the process of introducing this to her to hopefully address the emotional aspect of it. 

but I guess my question is this- if anyone on here has dealt with something similar. how, in the long term do you change your mindset? because I’ve lost the weight before and I can do it again. But never in a way that lasts where I don’t revert back to old habits.",1644964200.0

First time overdoing it on exercise,2,stisoj,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stisoj/first_time_overdoing_it_on_exercise/,2,"Cautionary tale time. 

I have a slightly addictive personality but have always sort of scoffed at the idea of being able to overdo exercise in the absence of say, an ED or obsessiveness over athletic pursuits. I have overdone it on many things but never exercise. 

I just got over covid for a second time and was determined to not let it wreck my progress like the first time, when I wasn’t able to work out or get my endurance back for four months. I disobeyed doctor’s orders and started slowly but consistently on the elliptical immediately after being allowed to get back into the world. 

I’ve been working out six days a week for over a month, a mix of cardio and weights. The scale hasn’t been moving but I am getting leaner, and more importantly my mood is better and so is my sleep. I’ve been feeling good enough that now I actually *want* to go to the gym all the time and that’s such a positive development, I’ve just been leaning into it. 

Sunday night, I had had a big plate of spaghetti after a rest day and I felt good enough to go hard. 35 min elliptical at a high intensity, leg + glute + lower back/abs, and then another 30 on the bike because I still had energy to burn. I got a BIG endorphin high. Felt amazing, drugged. Wanting to feel that way again, I went back to the gym the next night even though I was feeling kind of tired and burnt out. Nearly threw up but pushed through and felt so proud of myself.

Hey:) 
So I wanna start working out again after a long pause. Truth is there are SO MANY videos, programs, etc that I don’t know which one or where to start! I spent the last hour doing some research, but now Im feeling quite overwhelmed 😅

If someone wants to help a girl out please
-working out from home only
-equipment I have: dumbbells, yoga mat, kettlebell, elliptical, treadmill, resistance bands

Goals:
-lose weight and fat*(Priority)
-tone my thighs (reduce them), NOT make them bigger
-lift/reduce breast/chest
-lift/tone booty
-tone and get stronger
-Work my way to run a 5K (Already have a workout for this that I’ve done last year but open to other suggestions).

Ideally Id like a program but I have no idea which one as there are so many to choose from. Individual videos are great but not for me as I like to organize myself and have a structure. I am very aware I cant spot a specific area for weight loss but just thought Id mentioned all my goals.

Having trouble figuring out my calorie goal,0,stn79i,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stn79i/having_trouble_figuring_out_my_calorie_goal/,4,"
I’m starting to more closely watch what I eat and continue my weight loss. I gained some back since my lowest weight, but not spiraling out of control or anything. 

I thought this would be a good time to recalculate my calorie goal and I just want to make sure I’m setting myself up for success. 

I may need to update my flair, but I’m 27M 5’11’’ and about 245lbs. I work a sedentary job but I walk about 2-3 miles per day now (generally 2-3 separate walks of about 1 mile).

I used a TDEE calculator and for sedentary it says 2500 calories, for light exercise it says 2885 calories. Just for reference, it says my BMR is 2000 calories. 

I’d like to try to set a pace of losing about 2lbs/week so I think that means my goal should be 1500-1900 calories per day to be in a deficit of 1000 calories/day. 

Does this sound reasonable? And would you consider walking 2-3 miles per day “light exercise” or sedentary still?",1644986751.0
Let’s normalize and appreciate ‘maintenance mode’ and ‘weight loss breaks’ for what they are!,659,ssf0ba,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssf0ba/lets_normalize_and_appreciate_maintenance_mode/,57,"I have regularly incorporated weight loss breaks since about two weeks in to my weight loss journey. I alternate between a few weeks of deficits and a couple weeks of maintenance and here’s what I’ve learned!

1) weight loss is not my personality. 
How many of us are guilty of thinking, talking, reading about weight loss constantly to the point it’s almost the only personality trait we have?  I’m guilty of it. These breaks help remind me that I have other interests and give me space in the day to think about other things. 

2) weight loss is not the only measure of a person. 
Obvious right ? But when I am trying to lose weight every single week, it’s easy to feel like my weight at the end of the week is the only measure of success or failure. Having regular breaks reminds me that I have other goals, like reading a book to my daughter every night, and I can feel good about accomplishing those goals. 

3) maintenance is the goal!

Getting a feel for how many calories our bodies need to stay at the same weight is absolutely key! Ultimately we all want to get a certain weight and maintain it. Feeling the difference between roughly 1900 calories and roughly 1600 calories has really helped me get in tune with how much I’m eating. And I have a better sense for if I’m swinging the other way, like 2200 calories or something. 

4) I have less cravings:

This is because I know that the foods that don’t exactly fit into my deficit calories will easily fit into my maintenance calories a couple weeks later. 

5) I don’t binge. 

For me, this is big. And I think the reason is that I know this maintenance mode isn’t a cheat day where I can have anything and everything, it’s a couple weeks to eat the right amount of calories for my life style. I can have more than a diet allows, sure. But I know that if I yo ‘all out’ for a full week or two I’m going to undo my progress. 

6) LAST ONE:
Sometimes I need to work on other areas of my life. Sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me, my kids are sick, or I’ve got a lot on my plate. I don’t stop caring for my physical health by taking a break, I instead prioritize my mental health by taking something off of my plate. It isn’t laziness, it isn’t for lack of caring, it isn’t giving up; it’s an act of self love and self care to say ‘this week, I’m going to order in and instead of cooking, I’m going to take a bath tonight and wake up with a clean kitchen in the morning.’",1644857015.0

most of our rides end with us taking the same way home, which is a consistent incline through neighborhood streets. I've always hated it because it sucks to have to go up a bunch of hills at the END of a really long bike ride. most of the route I could do (while panting and sweating the whole time) but there's one steep street I've never made it to the top of without walking my bike.

yesterday was my first long ride since recovering from COVID, so after a 15 mile ride I expected this route to be especially hard. but it... just wasn't? I kept waiting for the hard part to come, but it didn't at any point. the whole way home was easy.

1) I am using myfitnesspal, which is telling me that I need to eat under 1212 calories per day. I already eat 80-90% plant based, and almost no processed food, so I figured it would be no problem for me to stay under 1212 and feel full. But no. I am literally hungry all the time and I cant believe how little food adds up to 1212 so fast. That's just me complaining though. My question is, when I read the posts on this sub, it seems like everyone thinks 1200 calories a day is ridiculously low. But this is what the app is telling me so...what source should I listen to? 

2) myfitnesspal just says to more or less do the best you can with tracking, and it's better to get an estimate than not track it at all. My issue is that I cook almost all my meals, so it takes FOREVER to enter the recipes into the tracker. Sometimes I will go through all that effort but most of the time I will just do a search for the dish and pick something that pops up that sounds ""about right"". The posts reading on here though are saying that this is wrong and I should literally be tracking and weighing every single thing that I eat. Can someone please provide some feedback on how necessary it is to be 100% accurate on this? Also...for the recipes already in the app, has anyone figured out how to see the ingredients? I just see the title (ex ""kale and cabbale slaw"") but I would like to see all of the ingredients.     


3) should you eat back your calories from working out? Ive read conflicting things about this. Some posts basically say that the calorie tracking devices are frequently wrong which results in folks over eating back their calories, so that makes me think no....but god damn I am hungry.

I eat 1400 calories a day, but I'm always thinking about food. It's fine during the day but in the evening (like right now) I'm so 'hungry' and want to just order a pizza and some icecream. Most days I don't, and I wait for the weekend.

Which results in me maintaining my weight right now instead of losing (not gaining either so that's something I guess lol). 

I'm just tired of feeling hungry during the week, 'bingeing' and drinking on the weekends (mostly one day, sometimes two), feeling guilty afterwards and not losing anything for months. 

How did you solve this problem? How can I resist to stuff myself in the weekends?

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 15, 2022",15,st0fon,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/st0fon/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_15_2022/,3,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why?

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

Let's talk about intermittent fasting.,2,stcc8m,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stcc8m/lets_talk_about_intermittent_fasting/,15,"I want to hear from you guys what intermittent fasting means to you, like what exactly are you doing.

There's a lot of strategies out there about how to go about Intermittent Fasting like OMAD is one of them or the hour restrictions ones like 16:8, 20:4 or then you have cyclical days like 5:2 or 4:3. 

I do more of the cyclical intermittent fasting 5:2 where 5 days, I will eat around my 1700-1800 daily calorie budget and then there are the 2 days where I will go to between 1100-1200. Which has worked out  fairly well for me but I'm already pretty good about what food I need to make and i am usually making the same kind of food I eat every day. 

I will do OMAD or 2MAD when I have events I'm hosting and I know that I am just going to be eating way more than usual. And remember caffeine can be a hungry inhibitor, so maybe drinking black tea and coffee [without all the extra sugar and milk] can help prolong hungry cravings for a little bit [not all day, maybe an hour or two] which I do because I usually am working all day without any breaks in my schedule so drinking my caffeine boosts stalls the cravings until I get the chance to get to it. 

I know having some high in protein in the morning has also helped in doing intermittent fasting as it stalls hunger cravings as well. I want to hear how you are doing your protein.

This is getting to be a long post so I hope to hear from you guys and have a bit of a nice discussion about this.",1644956493.0

The year was full of up’s and downs and I was stuck in the 140’s for the last six months today I got on the scale and it finally read 138, which means I am about 18lbs away from my original goal weight.

For me weightlifting has changed my life, even though I was stuck at a plateau i was still seeing changes in my body and performance, the only reason I even pay attention to the scale is because I am super short and extra weight makes my knees hurt so i find that when i am about 120 or so pounds my joints don’t ache as much. 

I just wanted to post this as an update to my progress but also to let you all know to take pictures of yourselves through this process sometimes I still feel like I look like i used too, sometimes it’s hard to stay motivated because I felt stuck in my progress which is easy to do when the changes are small and you see yourself everyday.

Putting these pictures side by side really astounded me, I can see so much progress I hadn’t seen without them. Measurements are awesome but i find if i can actually see the results it helps me better stay on track and celebrate how far i’ve come.

I hope you all have a wonderful day! Thanks for reading.

I've always had a ton of face and belly fat. Twist is I don't drink alcohol (haven't since I was a teenager), I don't drink soda, I don't eat snack foods and I don't eat fast food. I'm aware you can't spot burn fan. I try to be physically active 3 to 5 days a week. I usually try to weight lift and do different sports. I usually do roller hockey twice a week, some times ice hockey twice a week and usually try surfing twice a week and skateboarding almost every evening. I'm also very much the walking definition of skinny fat. I can gain tricep and bicep muscle but have skinny shoulders, skinny forearms and no chest muscles. 

I've been doing strength 5x5 for a few months now. I feel stronger and have increased the weight but haven't lost any fat from it.

The thing is, I am one of the very few people in my family that isn't extremely obese. My dad looks like John Candy and my mom looks like Mo'Nique (I'm biracial). My siblings as well as my aunts, uncles and cousins on both sides of the family are all fat as hell. A few weight over 250lbs!

I've felt the weight creeping, but now it's at an all time high.My previous ""record"" was 230 lbs, went down to 180 in a year, slowly crept up again and now I'm at 250. It didn't feel good, but I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it was.

&#x200B;

I ate like two pizzas today, and the aftermath definitely isn't worth it.

I know what I need to do, but at the same time I am lost. I've done this before, why is it so much harder this time? I want to blame depression and stress, but excuses won't help me. The past times I've tried starting again I haven't done it right. I will try better this time.

Tomorrow I am having my ""safe"" breakfast, oatmeal with milk. That's kinda my ""anchor"". It sets the standard for the day. I have grown used to ""luxury"" breakfasts after moving out with my girlfriend which sets a more unhealthy standard for the day. If my breakfast is delicious, so must the dinner be and so on.

I also took a photo of myself shirtless today for the first time in a long time. Another part I haven't done right in a while. I have a gym membership, but idk if I can bring myself to use it just yet. I will try (that's probably a lie) but I know how the gym mostly demotivates me. Also doesn't help how covid seems to have fucked up my stamina (along with the weight gain lol).

Anyways, I am gonna try this again. I want to be someone my newborn niece can look up to, I want to have the energy to be the fun uncle. I want to have the energy to be a fun boyfriend. A fun friend. Right now, nothing feels good and I don't want to spend my younger years like this any longer.

Tips for devopling a better eating schedule?,0,stn13q,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stn13q/tips_for_devopling_a_better_eating_schedule/,4,"I'm 16f and my goal is to lose 7kg (72kg to 65kg). I have a very bad past with EDs, starting at the age of 6, so my relationship with food has never been very good. My goal is to be able to lose weight healthily. My lowest weight was 62kg (had the goal of reaching 55kg), but at the weight I had multiple periods of 6-13 months where I didnt menstruate . I believe 65kg is the best for me since at 72kg, I have a bit of a stomach. I am around 163-164cm btw.

Unsurprisingly, I developed a unhealthy habit while trying to lose weight healthily. Before, I would eat a crap ton of food in the morning and very little the rest of the day. Now, the times had switched. I eat absolutely nothing during the day but I get very hungry and have a feast at night. I feel uncontrolled during these eating sessions, and I absolutely despise it. I get too gulity that I dont eat the rest of the day and then again eat a ton at night. This cycle is exhausting and is not at all convenient.

My request is to gather some advice to stop this habit of mine.. Ill like to start having a healthy relationship with food like a ""normal"" person. Thank you in advance.",1644986165.0
Nausea after fitness,0,stid18,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stid18/nausea_after_fitness/,6,"Hi everyone. I haven’t posted in here but have been reading everyone’s posts. Such a great community. 
My story. 
I’ve hit the weight loss hard this year. I’m trying to curb and reduce anxiety, depression, adhd, improve my confidence and have energy levels to support a parent - work- study lifestyle.  Last year was supposed to be my year of fitness and healthy eating but no, I ate through that year and had been sitting at about 209-216lbs. 
This year I’ve hit the ground running, With at least 45 minutes intense workouts per weekday.. 16-8 fasting, OMAD, keto and CICO.  I’ll eat the calories I’ve burned in my OMAD. Sometimes I’ll eat a bit more or a bit less. My BMR is about 1400calories. I’ll burn about 400-700 calories before 8am and I’ll eat about 500-600 calories for dinner/ through the day. With the fasting I am in deep ketosis where I check my blood ketones every other day. Last I checked I was 4.9mmol. 
Loss has been slow but relatively steady at 9lb this last month.  
Each morning before a work out I take a thermogenic tablet, magnesium, vitamin D, multivitamin, iron, acetylene tablet, plus I take L’tyrosine. 
This morning I did two workouts back to back (Meta fit and RPM) and all was fine during the fitness.  On the drive home I was feeling very nauseous, and threw up a lot of the vitamins from the morning plus water. 

Do you think it’s just an adjustment now to the increased fitness levels, or the tablets that might be causing this. I’m not feeling hungry through the day though I do crave a coffee each morning. 

Thanks for your advice.",1644972431.0

I constantly snack and my meals could be healthier. I was the thinnest I've been in uni at around 65kg, thanks to a general lack of things to eat but since moving home there's been a lot more available. That combined with heavy depression and starting antidepressants meant that my weight has increased and I'm now at 95kg.

 I've tried making changes but I can never stick to them. I want to eat less but there's always something I can eat at my parent's home and the option to skip a meal or change my schedule isn't there since we eat as a family. I can never find the energy for home exercise and the area that I live is very poor for jogging/gym access. I have problems with motivation in all aspects of my life and I always end up taking the easy way. I eat snacks even past the point where I feel full and feel sick afterwards.

What can I do to get some self control? To start a regimen, eat better, avoid cravings. I want to start with dieting and move to exercise when I generally feel healthier but another issue with that is my aforementioned lack of motivation which extends to not wanting to plan, buy and make food. 

I will eventually be moving out but the time for that is uncertain. I hope then I can control myself a bit more as I would be in charge of my own spending and food prep.

I was never this big until the last few years. Up until about age 45, I was on the upper end of a normal weight but I was a normal weight and never used to ""diet,"" at all, used to be pretty fit (ran half-marathons, etc.), then suddenly things sort of fell apart for me, I got into some bad habits, had joint problems, stopped being as active, pandemic stress, etc.  Bloodwork is normal (no weird hormone or thyroid issues).

I had been taking long walks during this past summer/spring, but then I got gifted with plantar fasciitis :( (probably because of my weight) so any heavy walking/running, etc. has not at all been possible for me. 

I'm not even sure where to begin. I found a video for very very very beginners for a 15-minute strength exercise routine and did it yesterday, but I don't feel confident in what to choose for my ideal calorie amount.

Did you have to do something special, like eat a certain way or fast?

I've lost a good amount of weight so far and plan to lose at least 10-20 more lbs (so end up around 135-145). The plan has always been to lose the excess weight down to X weight and then try body recomposition. I'm focusing a lot more on functionality and aesthetics, so I'm not married to ending up at any given numeric weight (as long as its a healthy one). 
However, I'm starting to wonder if my original goal weight of 125 is too low. I recently started BJJ where a bit of weight seems like it's helpful in throwing people around lol.

Feeling so hopeless…,2,stb4kr,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/stb4kr/feeling_so_hopeless/,2,"F 24 164cm 181lbs

The past year I’ve just watched my body go into decline. I’ve started a new job that makes me pretty sedentary, and I end up spending most weekends at my desk (sitting upto 12rs/day). I’ve gained 10 kilos, pushing me into the obese range, and my butt feels all dimpled and flat now. I caught a reflection of my behind yesterday while I was out and the closest thing I can describe it to is a grandma butt. 
I know the answer is more regular exercise and less food but I feel so mentally exhausted from work everyday that it becomes so hard to get myself ready to workout - and most days I end up “treating myself” with really rich foods. I’ve barely held onto my 10,000 steps and the odd home workout 1-2 times a week. I’m eating about 1800 calories a day.

Was anyone else in the same boat - i.e., lifestyle change made them more sedentary? How did you push yourself out of it, or are you still struggling? Any advice would be great right now.",1644953387.0
Today is the lowest I've weighed in 3 years,96,ssn5bs,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssn5bs/today_is_the_lowest_ive_weighed_in_3_years/,12,"Today is the lowest weight I've been since the start of 2019, three years ago. 81.7kg (180lb). I am completely aware this may fluctuate, but just to even hit this number is incredible. I've gained weight rapidly twice in my life. The first time was in 2015 after getting out of an abusive relationship. I shot up from 70kg (155lb) to about 78kg (172lb). This was also the first time I was completely independent and was building some unhealthy habits to deal with what was going on mentally. I'd lose a few kg here and there but wasn't able to shake what was really going on in my mind. 

I gained more weight again in 2019. I went from 80kg (176lb) at the start of the year, to 90kg (198lb) one year later (which was bordering on obesity for my height). That's fucking crazy now I think about it, but I was working under an emotionally abusive manager with no clue how to stand up for myself. I dreaded waking up every morning to head to a shitty sales job to be screamed at the whole day. There was no room in my anxiety riddled brain to make space for healthy eating, and the office cafe food was a great comfort at the time.

I've now been fasting and mostly sugar free since November. I've lost 5kg (11lb) since then with lots of ups and downs, but overall this has been the most consistent I've ever been. I checked some old food logs from August, and I can see how I struggled with my calorie budget when I treated myself to chocolate every day, and even if I budgeted it in I'd always end up going over since I used sugar as a coping mechanism for anything going wrong in my life. Now I don't buy chocolate or sweets or even let it into my house, because I don't know when to stop. I will always binge given the chance so I just don't let that happen. I try to do 16:8 most days and OMAD sometimes, and I feel less hungry overall than I used to. The craving to finish my day off with chocolate (and usually blow my budget) doesn't exist anymore because I simply don't have any to eat in the house. I was addicted to sugar, and used it as a coping mechanism to soothe my anxiety. It was a learned reaction to any discomfort and pain - ""treat yourself with food"". Now I know I'm not someone who can simply buy a pack of biscuits and portion them out to have ""just a little bit"" - I just don't eat them or keep them around.

I know I still have disordered eating to an extent, and a lot of negative thoughts around body image that sometimes make me want to give up trying because ""what's the point of any of this? You always gain it back"", the voice likes to say. But that's not entirely true. My skinnier self at a healthy weight who thought she was huge did not understand her patterns and self coping mechanisms like I do now. She may have been smaller but her eating was disordered. I may be heavier currently but I've read countless books, watched dozens of videos, and spent a lot of time unpacking my habits to understand why I am the way that I am. And I think I finally get it. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is the most important part is not necessarily counting your calories, fasting, keto, whatever it is you like to do. It's understanding your patterns from the past to predict your future actions and triggers. I've done CICO dozens of times over 10 years and I'd always lose a little weight. But the sadness and doubt would creep back in, something bad would happen and I'd binge and emotionally eat and undo all my good work. But I never fully understood my patterns and what would lead me to eat too much in the first place. This is not a quick journey by any means, but I trust myself that I am finally heading in the right direction, and can do this.",1644877760.0

I’ve recently lost some weight eating zucchini and frozen chicken nuggets, both oven baked, for lunch. 

The chicken nuggets are from Bell and Evans. I’ve been eating 400 kcal of them every day (2 servings) and 2 medium zucchini and it keeps me full all day. 

I’m looking for foods that require little prep, that I can just throw on a sheet pan with the zucchini and forget about. And that taste good without being too FODMAPy - eg Whole Foods brand chicken tenders had too much garlic powder. 

I’m not concerned about the carbs in the breading, but was alarmed to see that there’s 70 cal of fat in every 200 cal of nuggets, and I think I can do better than that. I do put olive oil on my zucchini so I have enough fat.

For context I’m 6’3, M,  130KG -> 105KG -> 120KG. While I was at my heaviest I dieted down to 105 with some somewhat aggressive CICO and some light cardio. I started weight training somewhere in the middle and in the last year i’ve climbed from my lowest 105KG back up to 120KG. I’m alright with it because I’ve got a lot more muscle mass so I like how I look at this 120 much more than 120 on the way down BUT I just can’t lose the extra fat.

I’ve realised my biggest limiting factor is the way I cook - I cook relatively healthy meals full of greens, centred around a protein source but somehow still can’t make a dinner under 1200 cals … and i just don’t want to … i could stick to just soy sauce as opposed to adding the sugar and cornstarch (for example) or I could steam the asparagus as opposed to sautéing it with some butter but I just can’t bring myself to make all these culinary sacrifices.

August 14 Weigh In- 225 
Enough is enough. Too out of shape to enjoy my son's birthday party. No confidence to put on a swimsuit. Nearly passed out on a short walk. Started Noom.

September 14 Weigh In- 220
Ambiguous and incomplete tracking of calories, but beginning to learn more effective coping strategies. Proved difficult as also dealing with grief. Still reliant on takeout.

October 14 Weigh In- 215.3
I replaced batteries in my digital scale and weighing daily. Bought a food scale and measuring to the gram. Wearing a FitBit and tracking calorie intake there because Noom is not accurate enough. Still doing Noom lessons. Going on short walks. Daily average steps- 4,569 

November 14 Weigh In- 207.2b 
I wanted to be under 200 before I turned 30 on the 5th but I had to manage my expectations. I really started to reduce takeout here and experimenting with new vegetables. Daily average steps- 7,530 

December 14 Weigh In- 199.0
I considered this my ""platuea"" but it really wasn't. I was determined to see the 1 in front of the scale that every day at 200.x felt like a slap in the face. I caught covid around xmas and prioritized my recovery by taking it easy with the diet and exercise. Stopped using Noom. Daily average steps-6,540 

January 14 Weigh In- 191.6
I started to increase my calories from 1200 to 1500 as I was dealing with late night snacking urges. I previously was able to overcome that through distractions like playing games, a hot bath, and a cup of tea. These strategies stopped working due to my increased exercise. Paying attention to macros and pushing protein with powders. I walked my dogs individually and a walk/jog for just myself. Some HIIT videos. Trying to be consistent with strength training. Daily average steps- 7,922. 

February 14 Weigh In- 184.1 
My next goal is 174lb so I would no longer be considered obese. While I am trying to slow down my loss I found that consuming more calories gives me enough energy to fuel intense workouts. Tdee.fit had my average TDEE at about 2,200 when I was eating 1200. And when I started eating 1,500 my implied TDEE became 2,500. My speed of loss hadn't slowed down at all! Considering eating closer to maintenance on full workout days so I can give it my all. 


Things I have learned about myself during this journey: 

-I deserve to be happy. 

-Despite the above, life will not necessarily be enjoyable if I am unwilling to put in the effort to take care of my self. 

-My food tastes better when I spend more time planning preparing and eating mindfully. 

-This means that screens detract from how satisfying my food is, so it's easier to overeat when food is not my focus. 

-When I depend on others for comfort I am more likely to give in to unhealthy suggestions. 

-If I want to prioritize MY health I must be able to think and act independently, resisting social pressures when they occur. 

-Sometimes prioritizing my health and happiness requires that I disappoint others or make sacrifices in some negotiable aspect of my life.",1644889833.0

Can anyone suggest vigorous indoor activity that will elevate my heart rate that would also keep the peace with my downstairs neighbors?

Thanks in advance 🙏",1644942957.0
starting to get really hungry now,3,sszno8,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sszno8/starting_to_get_really_hungry_now/,8,"Hi all. 
Been on CICO for nearly 10 weeks now. 
Current weight has been floating around 115-116.5kg for the last few days depending on what I've been eating. So lost 10kg so far.. body fat % has drop from 39% to 37.6%

For the last few days I have noticed I've been getting hungry.... I mean.   Really hungry before a meal. Mostly lunch and dinner.  I've been pretty good before with maintaining and controlling my hunger pangs. But over the last week I've noticed the hunger seems to have ramped up to a new level.
My set target calorie has been 1500 but it usually goes up to around 1800-2200 which is my current TDEE . Food has been 40:40:20 for protein fat and carbs. I'm usually pretty full after a meal so it is satisfying but I seem to get hungry quicker. I would drink a protein shake before going to gym to curb the afternoon hunger before but now it's not really working.

Most exercise I've been doing are cardio (treadmill and swimming) with some weight training thrown in occasionally.  Recently have ramped up my swimming intensity as my stamina improved.

Any suggestions to get over this hurdle?",1644919499.0

I'm finally realizing what it means to eat healthy,67,ssejh9,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssejh9/im_finally_realizing_what_it_means_to_eat_healthy/,19,"I'm gonna get flak for this I'm sure but the idea of eating and surviving on 1200 calories or doing OMAD is insane to me now because it really is unrealistic long term. This is going to be long but I need to get it out so pardon me

Story time:
A little bit of background, I started trying to lose weight in 2017 at my highest weight of 220lbs at the high of 5'1 3/4"" (don't judge that im that specific lol). My aunt and cousin were doing beachbody but I didn't have money for the shakes so I just followed the meal plan with the cups and worked out. I started in January and was down to 170lbs by October. My life went tits up for about a year and I stopped using the portion cups and tried eating less calories but not working out. I went back up to 204 before I decided to get my own account with beachbody(Nov 2018) shakes and all. Its a regret I can't take back but it gets worse. 

At the time I was working a shitty job that worked me 12 hour days and I got put on a team that was great but the team lead was a runner and I really wanted to be friends with her. She was nice and friendly and what I thought was a healthy skinny. It was not. I will always be grateful that she got me into running and I love it still, but at the time I didn't realize just how unhealthy her eating habits were to the point that she really did have an eating disorder. She did intermittent fasting which isn't bad but the way she did it was.
During the morning she would drink coffee and than around 10a she'd have another cup of coffee with 2 tblsp of creamer. Around 12 she would have a banana and pb and that she didn't really eat for the rest of the day but probably went home to have dinner. If we were really busy she didn't eat. She also told me I was eating to much with my portioned cups. I was suppose to be eating about 2000 calories a day with those cups and im an idiot and did it her way.

Around feb of 2019 I stopped doing my cups, started running a lot and was basically eating maybe 1300 a day at a weight of 170lbs at the time. I did get down to 162lbs but I was so unhealthy about it. I was tired and snappish and couldn't figure out why. I was also running fasted and running for more than 90 minutes and not understanding why my pace wasn't getting better. 

Fast-forward to end of 2019 I lost the shitty job, gained better employment and than covid hit and everyone was outside and I didn't want to run with them taking up the space I used for running. I didn't really enjoy running my neighborhood thinking people were judging me which looking back is stupid. I was running on and off and still was eating less calories than I should have and was up to 170 by the time I went back to work in July. Getting into the groove at work stressed me out and compounded with a new birth control that put me into a brain fog and moving to a whole new area it was a recipe for problems all the while still trying to lose weight and maintain myself at like 1200-1300 calories. And than disaster strikes.
In November I fell down my front steps of my apartment and severely sprained both my ankles. Long long story short I stopped running and just gave up because i was depressed. I went up to a high of 195lb and was stuck there. Recently in December I got the brain fog birth control removed which has been a real plus but I was still tired all the time and didn't know why. 

Anyway, I started reading alot about nutrition about 6 months ago and I got a new gym membership that include a personal trainer for 1 appointment. She told me about TDEE and I didn't listen and wasn't eating properly still. I was exhausted and doing a strength training program and I was frustrated until my female coworker who lifts and does weight lift competitions looked me dead in the face and was like ""you're not eating enough at all to lift and run and do basic body functions. your body is currently trying to tell you to eat more and your ignoring it. Stop that."" I respect her alot and for some reason it was like a clout to the head of me being dumb
So I did my TDEE again, put in all the right info and lo and behold with the way I run and stength train im suppose to be at least eating 2100 calories. On days I'm not doing anything 1800 calories. I went oh, well shit. Started eating the right amount even if it feels like force and im not exhausted all the time and my lifting and my running have improved. It's been amazing. 

So the moral of my story to share with you guys is stop starving yourself and being a yo yo. If your tired all the time get more sleep and eat more. I didn't know I was suppose to be eating at least 30g of carbs at every meal for energy. I had such a hard time because diet culture tells you carbs are bad

 I want everyone to succeed and to be healthy so don't starve yourself and accidently give yourself a weird eating disorder. Hope this helps someone out there.",1644855834.0

Some of you might already read my story here:

[My Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/rrgrbw/from_522_pounds_to_currently_188_pounds/)

Here on reddit regarding my weightloss. I promised in that post, when im near my goal weight, i will show before and after pics and: Im 1 pound away from it (im currently 79,1 kg and my goal is 78) so i want so share my before and after pics.

There are in total five pictures from different periods within my weightloss journey. Keep in mind i lost that weight in a timeframe of 3 years and 6 month, so yeah.

Another thing to be aware of:

Im not sure if that was necessary or if my insecure brain tells me to but: I marked this post as 18+ as my before picture is a censored version of me in my undergarment. You cannot see anything of value there besides the fact how big i was but keep that in mind as well.

So maybe about that before picture (the first one): That picture was taken one week after my weightloss surgery. You can actually see that because of the bandages i have on my belly. I dont have any scars or anything now, of course. Okay, i wrote enough stuff and before i loose the courage to actuall post this:

[https://imgur.com/a/lvNaIlU](https://imgur.com/a/lvNaIlU)

I hope that thing works. If not, please let me know. Looking that those pictures make me.... sad and proud at the same time. My BFF who i know for years now, was with me the whole time. She was with me, when i was very big and is now with me, after i lost all the weight. When i showed here this, she started crying and told me, how proud she is of me. To be absolutly honest here guys: there are days where i still see that woman in that first picture. But i am not anymore. The woman back then, wouldnt be able to do the things i can today. And im not even speaking of intense cardio or wearing nice dresses, im speaking about walking 10 meters or sitting in a damn normal chair. I worked so hard for this, i still am. Dont give up the fight guys, no matter how hard it is sometimes.

Edit 1: Oh man, thank you so much everyone for the positve Feedback, awards and words. You made my day.

Edit 2: Heilige scheiße, i just returned from my doctors appointment early in the morning and nearly spat my coffee on my keyboard. Thank you all for those comments, compliments etc. Im at a loss for words, really. Didnt think that would happen, to be honest. Im at work atm. but when im done i will come back and try my very best to answer all of your question. I tried my best to reply to direct messages already, but its to much to do via app with the comments. So please have some patients with me, i have some work to do :)

Edit to add: I tried my best to answer all questions and replied to some of your comments. 

Im honestly, without any doubt, overwhelmed over this massive support. I never, ever thought that would happen. Thank you so much for that people, im really gratefull for every nice comment, compliment etc. Never have expected, that people who dont know me, think of my as attractive or stylish. That really made my friggin year. 

For the ladys who commented regarding that Skull Sweater: It was my birthday present, so i have no idea where she got it from. She is always the one, giving me cute clothes. Im very sorry ladys!",1644771100.0

I don’t feel like my problem is healthy foods but rather the drinks I consume each day. I can eat healthy food as long as it’s seasoned good but I always have to have soda or else i don’t really have an appetite, I feel like soda completes the meal for me. 
I could be eating a salad and still have it with a Pepsi. It’s that bad… another example is me going to mc. Donalds the other day and ordering a meal with a coke, when I got home I realized the coke tasted flat and watered down and it just ruined the meal for me, I still ate it but didn’t enjoy it and I felt bad afterwards.

I go days without water (embarrassing to admit) luckily I haven’t had any uti’s or anything. Just to clarify, when I say no water I mean just that, I do however drink Powerade on the regular and juice.
I have tried adding the flavor packets to water, but it tastes horrible to me. I only like ice cold water and it has to be with something sweet like deserts.
I’m pretty sure I am an emotional eater and eat for pleasure and not to survive (idk just something my sister said to me once). Without going into my life story I really am here to see if any of you overcame a soda addiction and if so, how?

I've been resistant to it for awhile because I wasn't ready to take my weight loss journey seriously due to my anxiety and depression but I truly want to change that. My goal is to lose around 80 pounds.  I'm currently working on creating a personal collection of recipes with the calories included to simplify my days and meal planning. I'd like to post the recipes I create on here as a way of sharing my journey and holding myself more accountable but that will sort of depend on how this post is received (Idk people might hate my recipes, wont stop me from eating them though.) So for your approval, what I ate today.

Today my meals and calories amounted to:

**French toast over night oats (225 calories per serving)**

1 cup fat free milk (80 cal)

 1/2 cup water (can be adjusted for preferred consistency)

 1/4 cup maple syrup (220 cal)

2 cups oats (600 cal)

1/2 tsp cinnamon

1 teaspoon vanilla

a pinch of salt.

 Mix thoroughly and allow to sit in fridge overnight. Recipe makes four 225 calorie servings.

**Burrito bowl (667 calories per serving)**

3/4 cups white rice (480 cal)

1 can chili beans with liquid (350 cal)

1 1/2 cup frozen corn (270 cal)

3/4 cup water

1/2 tsp onion powder and chili powder

1/4 tsp chipotle powder

Mix all in a small rice cooker and allow to boil. Once cooked, serve 1/3 of rice and beans mixture with 3 oz white meat chicken (105 cal) or other preferred protein, 1/4 cup sharp cheddar (120 cal), 2 tbsp sour cream (60), and 2 tbsp salsa (15 cal). 

Aside from my recipes I had a cup of coffee with creamer, a chocolate chip cookie, salsa with tortilla chips, and some cereal (no milk).

My total was 1581 calories consumed. Overall my day was very carbohydrate heavy but I didn't experience any sort of sugar crash or excessive hunger so I consider it a win for now. As I become more comfortable with calorie counting I hope to create more balanced meal plans for my day but until then, I'm just going to prioritize staying below 1600 calories.",1644896131.0

I'd been a fatty my entire life up until a couple years back.
Motivated by loneliness, I made a serious effort with diet and exercise that lasted a little over a year.

I went from just over 300 to a minimum of 215. Even at my lightest I was still covered in the nauseating vestiges of my former size. Unhealthy skin and sagging, useless flesh.

In March, my dad died, and I didn't handle it well.  My life hit a telephone pole, and after I went through the windshield, I slipped back into my old, apathetic, hedonistic ways.

I haven't been brave enough to stand on a scale in months, but judging by my not-quite-human appearance, I'm certain I'm back above 300.  

My left femur/pelvic joint (hip?) has developed aching, throbbing, occasionally screaming pain while doing anything that isn't lying flat. It's been that way since May. This makes my favored form of exercise, long walks, no longer an option. I'm uninsured and uncertain what to do about my leg; it isn't getting better.

Even skinny me wasn't able to cure his loneliness.  I know my other problems eclipse my weight, I just wanted to vent about my lack of hope. I don't even have the motivation necessary to end my life.

I started losing weight a year ago and ended up losing 35lbs, and then stopped losing weight for basically an entire year. It was tough, I just lost motivation and stopped trying. The good news was that I also wasn't gaining any weight, I was pretty solid in the 157-162 range the entire time (with normal hormonal fluctuation for me). I started losing weight because I finally got on an antidepressant and finally felt like I cared about myself enough to take care of my body. I didn't want to lose weight because I hated myself, I wanted to lose weight because I loved myself. I was vegan for a while (currently vegetarian) and was really thoughtful about nutrition and activity.

It has been hard to be stalled this entire time, because I felt great when I was losing weight and was super proud of myself and giving up halfway through just sucked. I went back to old eating habits (while still eating significantly less, just eating worse food now). I often also struggle with not seeing any difference in my body. Even though I've gone down a couple sizes in jeans and tops, I still have trouble seeing any progress. Until I look at my face, and then I realize I have made progress and want to continue making progress. I've now gotten back into cico and I'm ready to keep going.

I'm an 18 years old female, at 65 kg right now and hoping to get down to 57 or 58 kg within the next two months if that would be possible, then, I'll slowly make my way to 54 or 53kg in the following months. I'm hoping to do this in a healthy way so that I can improve my lifestyle and health.

 While I am generally a confident person, my body weight has been making me feel quite unhealthy and depressed recently. I know we shouldn't derive confidence from a certain weight, but when I was at that weight 2 years ago, I felt great, healthy, and strong - something I want to experience again. 

Also, I'm graduating soon, and I really want to feel  good in what I wear and look like, I hope you all understand!! 

So currently, I've just started doing circuit training, I did 30 minutes today, and was thinking of doing a less intense workout tomorrow so that im not lifting weights two days in a row. Would it be a good idea for me to work like this? Alternating circuit training with other workouts? Do you guys have recommendations for something that might work better? I'm open to any home workouts, since that's all I have time for. 

Also regarding diet, since I'm aware that might matter even more than the exercise - I'm vegetarian, but I have a pretty crappy diet. I eat a lot of unhealthy snacks throughout the day which I need to stop, and definitely will stop to achieve this goal. Do you guys have any ideas for meals and drinks that might be good for weight loss?

Turns out that overeating doesn’t feel as good as it used to.",1644800204.0
I am proud of myself. I fell into a depression hole for a month and didn’t put on weight.,21,ssdm90,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssdm90/i_am_proud_of_myself_i_fell_into_a_depression/,0,"Tdlr: Started uni, lingering depression developed full blast, became fat, several failed attempts at weight loss, finally found something that worked in October 21, fell into a depression hole in January, binged, didn’t leave the house and worked up the courage yesterday to step on the scale for the first time in a month and a half. To my surprise I didn’t put on any weight. 
(Pro tip: don’t start a mechanical engineering degree unless you’re ready to become a fat, sad dementor.)

Long time lurker, but I never felt the need to post, but today I feel like sharing. 

A bit of background: I am 31f, 169cm (5’65“) and in late September 2021 I was the biggest I have ever been at 91kg (200lbs).  

All my life I’ve been pretty good, never overweight, a bit of a tummy, but nothing major. I was always active, never had a sedentary job. I was one of those people who could stiff their fave with anything without a worry. My friends used to tell me that they are getting fat just watching me eat. 

In 2017, I started uni, and it began. I was always a stress eater, so sitting at a desk all day and eating just to get through put on a fee kg, but nothing too serious.  
I had a bit of stuff happen in my childhood, and I suppose I always had high functioning depression. As time and uni went on, my mental health declined massively, to the point where I couldn’t function anymore. I started therapy more than two years ago and went on antidepressants. And I became hungry. So. Damn.  Hungry. All. The.  Time. I also moved less and less, because everything was so damn hard, everything was a chore. Well, it still is. 

When I was doing better mentally, I tried some weight loss programs, signed up to the gym, but I never had the stamina to stick with is, because uni consumed all my energy. 

When I was in my mental hole, I would order takeout to have more time to study, but have no energy, so I would sleep my problems to the next day, become more stressed and overwhelmed, rinse and repeat. 

Then, in late September I started a job in my preferred field, the company and team are awesome and everyone is really fit. I was almost done with my degree, so more energy there, and I felt motivated to tackle the weight problem once more, especially since I crossed that scary 90kg mark. 

But I learned from my past mistakes where I wanted to do too much, too soon, all at the same time. And even though I could never finish a program before, I did learn bits and pieces. 

From 12WBT i learned to calorie count. (I never had to watch, log and count what I ate before.) I also learned to meal plan. 

From a failed gym membership I learned that I hated machines, but I enjoy group classes, especially BodyPump and Yoga. 

From my MIL and my Fitbit I learned that walking, even a little every day, is better than doing nothing, especially on days where the gym feels like too much. 

I am lazy, so I found that rope skipping burns the most calories. 

From Noom I learned I should really drink more water, especially before meals. Thirst can manifest as hunger. Volume eating. Start each day fresh and dont dwell if you slipped on the previous day. 

From intermittent fasting, I learned about the first and second hunger. The first hunger alerts me that my stomach is empty, the second one that I should eat. 

From ordering precooked, healthy meals I learned that I really dislike eating microwaved food every day. 

So I made my own program.  
I dusted off the fitbit, because it motivates me to walk and to keep an eye on my heart rate.  

I found an awesome meal plan/ receipe app (Mealine) that connect to my grocery store which delivers my groceries. 

I started walking the dog again while phoning my friends overseas. That kept me entertained and I found myself walking more and longer. 

I signed up to the gym with the goal to go at least once a fortnight, increasing only if I felt up to it. 

By the end of December I lost 5kg. I had to quarantine because of COVID and I started my downward spiral, which ended with me in bed all day for the last three weeks. I ate massive portions, had no restraint. BUT: I managed to mostly stay away from takeout and had mainly ingredients for healthy food in the fridge. For some reason I had mad cravings for oats with bananas. 

So yesterday, I finally got myself out of bed and onto the scale. To my surprise, I am the same weight as I was before my spiral, 85kg.  
This makes me so happy, one less thing I have to fix, I can just pick up where I left off. 

Thanks for reading, and I apologise that this turned into a massive wall of text.",1644853523.0
TIL I had miscalculated my TDEE...,6,ssk7uh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssk7uh/til_i_had_miscalculated_my_tdee/,1,"Ok, I've been on my journey awhile. Been up and down, like most of us have.  I'm on the wagon and doing things by the book.  Today, while in a meeting that I didn't want to pay attention to (hellooooo ADHD!), I decided to see if my TDEE had changed with my recent small loss (small wins, right?).  Turns out, I had miscalculated my TDEE and was eating at maintenance.  Get this, though, my attention to detail had left me with a \~100kcal surplus daily, and I wasn't eating back my calories from 'exercise' (daily walking totals, not intentional exercise) and I lost 2 lbs in 2 weeks (I use 4 day averages as my basis for the loss).    
Today I learned:   
Staying the course really does work, even if its slow going.   
At 'maintenance' I really do feel satisfied daily if I'm eating REAL foods, especially filling ones.   
Use data to your advantage, not your detriment.   
My (admittedly early and limited) tips:  
When the cravings for sugar are bad, I take a low sugar orange fiber drink supplement (Metamucil), and drink a ton of water afterwards.   
At night, when you want to snack BAD-GO TO BED! Seriously, I think my 'tired' cue might manifest as a deep hunger for high calorie food.   
Tracking your food without judgement is so dang informative! Just do it!   


Just putting some positivity in your lose it feed.  Stay the course, you've got this! (And I do, too!)",1644869870.0
VENT Will I ever lose weight?,0,st1ltw,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/st1ltw/vent_will_i_ever_lose_weight/,2,"I spent my childhood with a diet-obsessed mother and a cooking-obsessed father, both of whom showed their love through food. I *always* thought I needed to lose weight (even though I was a perfectly healthy BMI) but at the same time, always had a big appetite and loved eating. When I was 16 I got serious about losing weight, and succeeded by eating tiny portions and cutting out all snacks. Cue 5 years of constantly being hungry, thinking about food all day, and losing my period(!) just to fall in the middle of the healthy BMI category and get stuck in a binge-restrict cycle.

Then since the start of the pandemic I slowly gained weight, partly due to trying to get my period back, partly due to not having the mental strength to restrict anymore and wanting to stop the binge-restrict cycle (which I have done, although I will still happily eat much larger quantities of food than I need sometimes just because I enjoy eating), and partly due to a very stressful final year at uni. Now my BMI is 25.4, which is only just in the overweight category, but I feel like *so much* of my mental space is taken up by: planning diets, then not doing them, then feeling guilty for giving up, then thinking about food I want to eat, then thinking I should learn to eat intuitively, then not knowing what food I *should* eat to lose weight (low carb? low fat? obsess over counting calories? slowly build habits doing...what exactly idk??) then wishing I could be skinny again (because even though I was starving and cold, I miss being thinner, and I just feel *heavy* and unfit at this weight).

I just feel so stuck. I have two very clear goals: to lose weight and stop being obsessed about dieting, but I don't know how to get there. Counting calories just makes me more obsessed. I already eat healthy foods, just obviously more calories than I need. I just feel like I'm doomed to be stuck in this cycle for the rest of my life - always having the mental strain of weight-loss on the back of my mind but also slowly gaining.

Ahh I'm sorry to be so negative on this sub, I just hope there's someone out there who has been through something similar and has advice. I'm 22 btw.

Also please don't just suggest ""therapy"" without any other explanation - if you've had a similar problem and have gone through therapy and that's fixed it *then* I'd be interested to hear what you have to say about it, but I really don't know how I'd go about getting therapy as I currently live with my parents.",1644927178.0

It just occurred to me that I could just put the oil bottle on my digital scale before and after pouring, then note the difference.

How much should i expect and how i can i minimize it?",21,ss9x2x,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ss9x2x/lost_almost_55lbs_now_still_going_strong_but_im/,8,"Hello, so i'm 29 and 6'. About four years ago i started my weight loss journey. I used to weigh 127kg(279 lbs) at my largest. That was around the end of 2017 when i started with some 16/8 intermittent fasting. I didn't really workout, just done some fasting and watching a bit what i eat, no sweets and sodas etc. I lost weight until i was around 110kg(242lbs). This was all diet, no workouts.

Then i stopped  and for 2019-2021 i just held the weight with a bit of a gain back to 112kg(246lbs). I just held the weight. Now since the middle of December of 2021 i started back up. I returned to some fasting, not religiously tho, cut out most of sweets and sodas, started cycling for my errands, started working out my muscles and doing some low impact HIIT.

Since then i've gone down to 102-103kg(225-227lbs). Now since the better metric to use is Bodyfat percentage i wanna get down to a BF of around 20% with potential to hover in the are of 15-20%. This would roughly put me at a weight of aroun 81-86kg (180-190lbs)

Since this is a big weightloss, naturally i am concerned about loose skin. I won't remain overweight because i'm scared of loose skin, it is a consequence i will have to accept. However i would like to remedy it and inform myself as much as i can so i can minimize the impact.

So a couple of questions. 

How much loose skin should i expect? Did me holding the weight for so long have an impact since the skin wasn't as stretched as before for three years? What can be done do minimize loose skin? Is plastic surgery my only option when there is loose skin or can it gain back the elasticity?

Thanks very much to everyone who replies.",1644843241.0
"I’ve lost 26.5kg in 29.5 weeks, I’m so proud",103,ss1by9,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ss1by9/ive_lost_265kg_in_295_weeks_im_so_proud/,8,"28F(transgender MtF on HRT with average T levels for a cis woman) 
At first it was difficult, counting every calorie weighing food, working out 5 days a week and really going hard. But gradually with time it became easier and easier and I achieved my weekly target week after week, a 1kg loss (1000
Calorie deficit daily). Now I will add at this point that I never once refused myself unhealthy foods, or going out for drinks with friends once a week but I always ensured to keep at it and make sure that if I had a bad day over that I balanced it out with a day of eating less and more healthily. 

I’m sure many will say that I haven’t done things the best way up to this point having these days of poor eating and maybe not maintaining the healthiest eating habits but we can’t all be saints and I know that for me this has worked. 

During the time that I was eating better and hitting the gym I started skateboarding more too which eventually overtook my gym routine and became my regular exercise and still is, I believe that it burns a significant level of calories with the hours that I will do in a day (4-6 rather than 1-2 in the gym). 

In December I took a trip to Mexico for 6 weeks, at which point I stopped calorie counting and rather began relying on my own mental calculations as to what would constitute an appropriate amount to eat given my level of activity whilst I was over there since it’s hard to track what you’re eating when you eat out every meal. When I left for Mexico I was 94.6kg and upon returning I weigh 89.5kg. 

I’m so proud of the lifestyle changes I’ve made and the change in my willpower, activity level and mindfulness it just feels amazing. I’ve attached the chart from MyFitnessPal and also a before/after pic with the most recent photo being back in December before a further loss. 

I hope this shows that your life doesn’t have to forever be a calorie counting nightmare that goes on forever. My journey isn’t finished just yet and I’ve got around 10kg more to go but I should be there by summer, keep strong and YOU CAN DO THIS TOO!

I’m 43/F and while it’s varied a bit I’m currently still about 50 pounds overweight. I’ll never stop working toward my goals, and I know I’m gonna be ok. 💪🏼

Except for one summer when I was 21, I have lived my entire life in the Pacific NW.  It gets warm here in the summer, but it’s not humid and it cools down overnight. Hubby and I are considering a move to either Indiana or West Virginia. I’m very concerned about how I will handle the heat, because I despise it and it actually makes me physically Ill. I am concerned that it may interfere with outdoor workouts/athletics. 

For those of you who live east of the Rockies and also don’t like heat/humidity, 1) how does the spring/summer heat affect your workouts and also 2) for real what do you wear on a day to day basis, for work/casual/working out? I step outside for 5 minutes in the East and I feel like I need a shower. Due to how I carry my weight, I have to wear knee length shorts and it’s usually Jean shorts to hide thigh chub but I don’t see that being possible when it’s that hot.

Seems insignificant, but my current size and the weather is a significant factor in selecting a new homeland. Any reality checks for me would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",1644887872.0
5 Month Progress Pics + Some Things I've Learned,934,srlnqc,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srlnqc/5_month_progress_pics_some_things_ive_learned/,42,"[https://imgur.com/a/BL80yxv](https://imgur.com/a/BL80yxv)

  
[Link to one of my first posts with some of my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/rc8jyy/40lbs_and_lowest_ive_been_since_2017/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Some of the things I've learned so far:**

* The scale is not always your friend. While it's an objective way of tracking where you're at, it's a tool to help us make strides to getting to an objective goal. However, there are points where objective progress can't be seen and we have to rely on subjective progress. For me personally, the scale hasn't budged in two weeks and it's pretty frustrating, but the way I look in the mirror is better, I'm more confident in my skin, clothing, etc. Ultimately I know my body is still healthier and getting healthier if the scale it stuck for a second.
* You don't necessarily have to have a cheat meal. For a while I thought that on a weekend I would treat myself to a cheat meal, but slowly that has just started making me feel worse. The cheat doesn't feel as good and ultimately makes me feel pretty bad physically, so I've scratched them out. Also...cheat meals need to be just that...not a cheat day. I've got a close friend trying to lose weight who will eat well Monday-Friday, and then just eat everything in sight on Saturday, and weight the exact same Sunday morning that he was the previous Sunday if not more. Cheat meals aren't worth it if they derail you for the rest of the day/weekend.
* Some people will get it and some people won't. We celebrated my wife's 30th birthday a few weeks ago and someone made note of how I wasn't eating anything at the party (I had meal prepped and eaten my dinner before anyone had arrived so I wouldn't cheat). They couldn't understand how I'd spend all this money on food and desserts and then not partake in any of them myself. Constant remarks about it made me feel kind of self-conscious and like everyone was up in my business and making me feel like I was an idiot for not doing the ""normal"" thing. **However**, one friend had said it was pretty amazing and I was showing a lot of discipline. I hadn't thought anything of it. My wife told me later that night that this same friend had pulled her aside and said, ""I'm really proud of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. He looks great and what he's doing is working. I have been at a lot of events or settings with you guys where he'd normally just go crazy and eat and eat and eat but he hasn't done that and it's really great. He's sticking to it."" So, again, some people get it and some people think you're crazy.
* You're inspiring people, whether you know it or not. When. you really start shedding the weight or gaining muscle or carrying differently, people notice your confident, your attitude, etc. For me, people notice my confidence, my improved mental/emotional health, and my being more attentive (I think back when I was eating really poorly one sign was I was sleepy all the time). My two best friends have begun exercising and entering into trying to eat better. My brother in law reached out to me yesterday to talk about physical and mental health and tell me he's starting back up counseling and is going to start working on his physical health because he's seen all the ways it has improved my life and family aside from just physical health.

TL;DR: The scale isn't the only gauge for success, cheat meals aren't required and if you partake in one don't let it become a full day or weekend, you'll have people who understand what you're doing and some who won't, and most importantly, you are an inspiration to all whether you know it or not. Tons of you internet strangers have helped inspire me to keep going so thanks for that!",1644767582.0

Now I can kind of guess what that part means, but I'm wondering about how it effects my body. 

Let's say I eat an arugula salad, eggs, turkey, tomatoes, almonds, cheese etc. It's 300 calories.

Either way it's the same calories, but will eating the salad help me loose weight faster than the cake? Maybe this sounds like a stupid question, but I just don't have a super complex understanding of the whole thing yet. 
I get that the salad would make me feel more full, and likely have more protein which would give me more energy. But I'm strictly wondering about how it effects weight loss. TIA",1644865194.0
"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 14, 2022",19,ss814q,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ss814q/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_14_2022/,5,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

over the last year, i literally cannot take pictures or look in the mirror without hating what i see. i go through periods of trying to lose weight and not, currently getting back into the former. but as a teenager, i can count on one hand the number of experiences i've had worth remembering, because i refuse to go out. i feel like i don't deserve to go out or enjoy things because i look so much worse than everyone around me, who are relatively healthy.   


 i know im not huge, but it's starting to dominate my life. any tips on getting out of this feedback loop? thanks in advance :)

What part of your body did you first notice weight loss?,1,ssrcjf,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssrcjf/what_part_of_your_body_did_you_first_notice/,11,"I have lost 28 lbs and I am a a bit disappointed by the results. I have only noticed weight loss in eird my wrists ankles and fingers. I can't even wear my ring anymore because of how much of a difference there is. I really can't tell the difference in before and after pictures of my stomach and thighs, where I wanted to see weight loss. All my clothes fit the same. My husband also said he can't really see a difference and no one else has seemed to notice. I have only achieved weight loss by staying in a calorie deficit so it is not because of muscle gains

I have lost weight before in high school and it was very noticeable everywhere. It is very frustrating considering all the work I put into teaching myself how to eat healthy. I want to know if I have set my expectations too high. I have had more energy and felt better overall.

Is this normal for the first part of weight loss? I am 212 lbs right now, how much more weight should I lose before I see a difference in other parts of my body?",1644890141.0
The weirdest thing happened at Valentine's dinner...,444,srmdu5,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srmdu5/the_weirdest_thing_happened_at_valentines_dinner/,25,"We have kids. Those kids have a dance on Valentine's Day. So we decided to have our dinner out last night. Got a babysitter, arranged reservations, got all dolled up, and went out for a nice night.

We ordered a mostly protein appetizer and an entree for each of us. I also got a Chai tea. We split the appetizer, it was delicious, and I had skipped lunch to save calories and be able to have a bigger dinner. Then the entree arrived, and it was also delicious. But about halfway through, I realized it was too much. And it wasn't even all that big, just bigger than I needed for the dinner. After all, we'd already had the appetizer, and portion sizes in the US are ridiculous.

So I contentedly set my extra food aside to be packed up, sipped my tea, and chatted with my husband as he polished off his plate. He ate everything offered to him, and even a bite of mine to try it. Then afterward, we got to spend some time walking around the mall to just look at jewelry. I wasn't too bloated to move, and my high heels didn't even hurt (amazing what losing 50 pounds will do).

And today, today I have delicious leftovers. And no guilt. None whatsoever. I really did enjoy last night, and I didn't need to eat nearly as much as was offered to me. I didn't even want to order dessert, and I always used to order dessert. Dessert options even looked good at the beginning of the meal. But I was just too full to even consider them once I'd made it about halfway through the entree.

Yesterday was a good day. The start of many more good days to come, I think.

You can do this!",1644769437.0

I picked up rollerblading about two months ago and I love it. It gets my heart rate up and I enjoy the cardio. After about two months straight incline blading at least 1:30 - 2 hours 3-4x a week, I finally stepped on the scale and found out I am the heaviest I have ever been. 

Now I’m wondering if I should continue. I know I’ve gained some muscle mass, but 15lbs? I’m so confused. I’ve done everything on this weight loss journey but lose weight.

I absolutely love skating and this has been the only cardio I truly enjoy.",1644884960.0
How to get my lazy butt back in the gym after 2.5 weeks?,4,ssep2d,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssep2d/how_to_get_my_lazy_butt_back_in_the_gym_after_25/,14,"I haven't been to the gym in like 2.5 weeks. Even then, I went like 2x a week. I was studying for a big test to get licensed for nursing, and it completely just drove me nuts, and one day I just said ""I'll get back to it"". I would try to ride my bike out if I could during that time, but it's too damn cold and I only rode it a handful of times... I passed last Friday, and to no avail have I made the effort. I remember loving the gym and feeling weird if I didn't go. I still want to go. Now, I'm on a different seizure pill, and it makes me sick to my stomach at certain times a day. I signed up for a spin class to take this morning at 8am, but I cancelled last night cause I was feeling so sickly in my guts. Now I'm scared to bike out alone cause I don't know what to expect with this pill. I gotta be in the gym, but how did you guys fix this laziness? 😭 I've lost 50-60lb total.

I am a 5'4"", 28yo Female and I don't know what I weigh because I error out all the scales I try. A good guess is around 345-350. 
I am a mom to two young kids and I don't even come close to keeping up with them. 
Between my pregnancies, the PTSD, the depression and my total apathy for life, I have gotten myself here. 

I can't stand for long periods of time without being in pain. I don't fit in chairs. Seat belts don't reach. My menstrual cycle is almost nonexistent now, my entire body aches. 

I know I need to make a change, but I am so lost, and overwhelmed, and ashamed, and scared. I don't even know where to begin. 

I need help. I don't have a doctor at the moment and I've found in the past that they get really stuck on my numbers and tend to just use scare tactics but aren't actually helpful, and absolutely everything gets blamed on my weight.

I want to be healthier. I want to be able to play with my kids. I want to be able to function in society again. I want to enjoy things. 

Ideally I want to be told exactly what to do and what to eat/not eat to make this happen, but I know that's not how it works. I just do much better with a buddy. 
I don't know where to start, so any direction at all would be so greatly appreciated.

What do you think of my wireframe progress pic/wireframes instead of photos?,2,ssnzmw,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssnzmw/what_do_you_think_of_my_wireframe_progress/,5,"I'm a pretty private person, and I really don't like the idea of shirtless photos of me online. I know many folks cover or cut off their face, but I just don't like the idea of my body online, anonymous or not.

As a result, I don't ever post progress pictures online. But I sort of stumbled across the concept of wireframe progress pics - instead of an image of me, it's a wireframe representation of my body. I don't know why exactly, but I have a much lower negative reaction to it than regular photos.

How often and in what ways can I reward myself?,1,ssj24c,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssj24c/how_often_and_in_what_ways_can_i_reward_myself/,7,"I have a ton of weight to lose and at the same time I am also coming to understand and accept my transgendered self. Because of this, I want to set up a system of milestone rewards that provide benefit to both my weight loss journey and my transition. At the start of all of this, I wanted to lose weight first and then transition (socially, medically, etc.), but I recently had this idea that because transition is not the same for any two people, there's no reason I couldn't consider losing weight as part of my transition. It's all about working towards a body that best represents my identity, and being at a healthy weight is part of that identity goal. This way I can focus on my weight loss and not feel like I'm delaying or not working towards this idea of transitioning. Every day I lose weight or feel a bit better about myself is transition progress. 

And so the point of this post is to come up with a system of rewards that keeps me motivated in my weight loss but also allows me the freedom to explore my gender. 

* How often should I reward myself? Every 10 pounds? Every 20? Should I have consistent rewards or rewards that escalate at more ""significant"" milestones (e.g. dinner out for losing 10 pounds but a full spa day for losing 50). 
* What are some good rewards to do? I think it'd be good if these escalated in line with my affirmed gender. For example, because I'm not out yet, I have no purpose to reward myself with a nice dress (other than maybe some lounge clothing). But as I work through transition, that type of reward may be more valuable down the line closer to my goal weight. However, something like a mani/pedi could be a useful early reward (clear coat or not) that could then escalate to doing colors and acrylics as I'm more socially transitioned.",1644867003.0
Kinda question/kinda a rant. How do I get over the first hurdle?,3,ssfsx4,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssfsx4/kinda_questionkinda_a_rant_how_do_i_get_over_the/,6,"I keep putting off so many things in my mind as something I’ll do once I’ve lost weight - I think about how much more confident I’ll be, the clothes I’ll wear, how much my life will improve etc etc.
I really dislike the way I look now, and how I struggle with exercise to the point it restricts me doing things I know I’d enjoy.
And yet, I still don’t start! I keep eating the way I do. I do the occasional work out and then slip right back into doing nothing all day.
I got into a really good routine in the first lockdown and lost 30lbs. I could run without stopping for 25 mins! But then I got made redundant and got sad and gained it back.

How do I get over the first hurdle? Does anyone have tips on improving discipline? 

I find myself constantly choosing to snooze my alarm instead of working out before work, or instead of making a healthy lunch to take with me. There just seems to be something stopping me doing it and I don’t know how to make myself do it. I get so frustrated. Why am I like this!

16 year old males weight loss plan… will it work?,1,ssnoet,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssnoet/16_year_old_males_weight_loss_plan_will_it_work/,8,"Recently I’ve decided I’ve simply had enough of being fat, I’m a 16 year old male with massive self confidence issues because of it so now is definitely the time to lose it. I know I currently eat wayyyyy too much junk food and sugary drinks and not enough fruit and vegetables so this is change number one in my lifestyle, I’ve decided to stop eating Chocolate, Biscuits, Crisps, Ice Cream ect ect and replace it when I get hungry with Fruits because I’m honestly not a fan of vegetables but I’m more than happy to eat fruit! 

Secondly I’ve recognised that on my walk to and from college Monday-Friday I achieve 10000 steps every day and I can gain up to 12000-13000 if I take a trip to the shop for lunch and back to college so this is my exercise plan, on weekends I’m not active at all currently and I intend on changing that so I can also do 10k steps on a Saturday and Sunday. I don’t know if this will be enough to lose weight though so will I need to do more? 

That’s basically it, I’m tracking my calories but I’m finding that Dinner meals are the most unhealthy and currently I can’t change this because my parents do the cooking every night and aren’t willing to buy healthier alternatives unfortunately, I could do the cooking myself but on top of Homework and my free time it seems a step too far in my goal to loose weight. Will this hold me back? As I said Breakfast and Lunch are healthy and so is my snacking!

The gym and reducing calories,2,ssijw3,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssijw3/the_gym_and_reducing_calories/,3,"Hey there, a friend and I have hard committed to a gym when they open here (Ontario) and I am looking for advice. I've used CICO to lose 80lbs what feels like a lifetime ago, but a broken relationship and covid has changed that drastically.   


I am 5'8, 270lbs, male, and I currently have been reducing my intake for the last month to about 15-1700 calories a day. I have gotten used to a good routine and I started at 295. I am happy with my progress and I know if I keep at it, I'll do well.  


But with the gym, this is me working on my mentality, I don't want to reach goal weight and then just go ""oh, journey is done"" I want to change everything.  


Sorry for the long post, my question is, do I increase my intake? focus on cardio? I haven't been to a gym since highschool, my friend is far more experienced, but not with losing mass weight. I am just lost on how combining a gym routine works with CICO. Thanks for reading.",1644865742.0

Stuck - Any advice?,4,ssbvpk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ssbvpk/stuck_any_advice/,6,"After having lost 120 lbs I put 20 lbs back on. I am trying to relose that 20. Not prepared to go back all in on the plan I was on. I had a really hard time at the end and would rather avoid it if possible. But here is what I am doing. 

For background, I am a 5'10 202lbs 43 yo man. 

I have a daily calorie budget of 2170. I use Noom (which I used to lose weight in the first place) to keep track of my calories. Really though I only use 1970, and try to keep that last 200 on the assumption that I am undercounting somewhere along the way. 

On the exercise front: I start the day alternating sets of modified push-ups and squats until I have done 3 sets of each. I do that 5 days a week. During the workday, circumstances permitting, once an hour I take a quick lap around my building. Not sure of the distance on that, but it's about a 2-minute walk. 

After work, I go to the gym and do 45 minutes of cardio. Either a stationary bike or elliptical. 

If it's the elliptical I start at level 22, every 5 mins I go up a level until I get to level 25 and finish at level. Same idea on the bike, but right now I am starting at level 9 and go up every 2.5  minutes until I get to level 15 and finish going at that level. Judging just by my galaxy watch, that usually works out to burning around 400-450 calories. FWIW,  the bike says about the same thing, but the Elliptical says its closer to 750-800. 

After the cardio, I do some strength training. The order depends on what equipment is available at the time but I do the following

Bicep Curls 3x15 at 50lbs

Chest Press 3x15 at 50lbs

Ab Crunch 3x50 at 70lbs

Shoulder Press 3x15 at 40lbs

Lat Press Down 3x15 at 70lbs

Chest fly 3x15 at 50lbs

Before I go to bed, I do 3 sets of normal push ups.

So my question is, should I be losing weight cause right now I am not? Since the beginning of the year, my weight has stayed pretty steady. What am I doing wrong?",1644848807.0

So I started working out last summer. My plan consisted of daily cardio and eating less food. I lost 60 pounds in 5 months and I can say most of my fat is gone. I can literally see my ribs when I stand in front of the mirror. But I still have some stubborn belly fat. My forearm and hands look skinny but my arms are still big and I feel like they got a lot of fat stored in them. My thighs and butt are very thick and I hate them. But below my thighs are skinny and almost no fat there.

I'm not on a specific diet. I just eat two slices of whole grain bread with white cheese. One cup of low fat milk 2 hours later. Anything for lunch (Though I recently replaced red meat with soy). Usually an apple or half a banana in the evening. And something low cal for dinner (usually boiled eggs).

I cut on daily cardio and instead try to do 3-4 times a week of cardio and weight training for the rest. Plus 50 sit-ups in the morning when I wake up.

That's it. How do I lose this fat? I want nicely shaped legs and skinny arms. Also I want to get rid of my belly fat. It's annoying when I have no clothes on.

The problem I am having though is figuring out calories for either one-pot throw together meals or even things that are given to me for the family to eat. Seriously though thank you Mom for your awesome food you make too much of lol.


For example, husband makes a great cabbage soup. I know SORT OF what goes in the soup but he's also a chef so he'll add/subtract/change recipes as he fancies. I also make a lot of these types of meals (chicken and noodles, chicken rice and broccoli casserole, etc) so it's hard to even determine what a serving size of those meals. They're usually served right out of the pot and the rest is packaged as leftovers.


Another example... my mom sent me home with a big container of barley soup. I have no idea what she put in it or how much. 


So how does everyone approach these situations? The only idea I can come up with is just finding the entry in Lose It that seems the closest? So maybe 1 cup of barley soup is what I can settle with to give me a rough idea.

I uncomfortably (RE-) explain (she comments every single time she sees me) that yep, I've been spending the last 13 months watching what I eat, working with a certified postpartum coach, playing with my toddlers, and working out when I can. (My ""uniform"" is leggings and an old t-shirt alwayscovered in spitup/boogers/food/drool/etc lol, I'm not even dressing ""hot"").

She replies- oKaYyyy

and normally I brush it off, but this time it really did hurt. It was so uncomfortable the way she sat 2 feet from me criticizing my body for being my healthiest version ever! I'm 5'4"" 132lbs - toned and HAPPY! 

Background: we lost our first baby late in the second trimester, f*^%ing heartbreak.  Our rainbow was born early but is healthy and great (2y) we then were blessed with our second nugget (1y) (I was on a lot of extra progesterone to help me keep her in). Anyway, after three years of back to back pregnancies, extra medication, weight increases to 200 pounds, postpartum depression/anxiety, and a lot of trauma around our loss and their subsequent early births- I worked my ass off to find the right therapist, the right coach, ask for help from those around me, bond with my babies, lean on my husband, and reconnect with myself! 

Long story long, I'm so damn proud and it feels like she keeps trying to take that from my by first insinuating, and now blatantly, saying that I'm doing something unhealthy.  I also realize that the majority of people have not seen my ""normal"" body since I have basically been pregnant or just postpartum since 2018 (which was when we moved here).

I wish I could just avoid her completely but that's not possible. Between having a small community, having same aged kids, and being on the board together, we are always crossing paths. 

The next time she says something I will push back, not sure how exactly. -Should I first tell her it's inappropriate that she comments on my body?
-Should I ask her what exactly she's concerned about?
-How can I respond in a way that firmly let's her know that she is in the wrong?",1644764406.0

And in the process I came across you guys. Such an uplifting, inspiring group of lovely losers. And all the happy happy memories I had and occasionally shared of the time I was skinny. And all the compliments I got. But being skinny isn't my priority right now. My priority was wrong all this time. It's a now-or-never decision to steer myself back on the right track. 

Right now, I'm faced with a decision: I can either stick with school and graduate successfully, or keep losing weight, my mind, and my chances at college. for my own benefit, I choose the latter.

I thank every single one of you for your support, whether it be direct or indirect. My plan now is to step down for a while and maybe come back to this whole weight loss thing in my adulthood. If I could get to where I am now, I can do it again.",1644843297.0

I've lost weight in unhealthy ways in the past.  In high school and college I would skip meals constantly. Then I got into various tracking apps like my fitness pal and weight watchers.  Each time I do it I lose weight but not in a healthy way.  I quickly become obsessive with exercisng, counting calories and manipulating the system. I regularly would just eat one meal of junk food a day and then water only.  I lost weight but obviously I gained it back each time and usually a few extra pounds too.

Diet culture can be very toxic. I must avoid that for my mental health.  I've realized that just because I'm planning to celebrate a birthday tomorrow with a slice cake I still need to eat today. I want to focus on sustainable change by moving more and eating vegetables more than once a week.  

Like most people I've lost and gained the same 40lbs over and over.  I'm ready to change permanently but I'm terrified of failing and that I'll end up going to a mentally unhealthy place again.

I never truly started it up again even though I mostly still follow it. Also discovered my tomato allergy seems like it developed into a full blown nightshade allergy since I had an anaphylactic reaction to potatoes and couldn't realize why my face was going beet red immediately after eating all month. So I cut out all nightshades and have felt so much better since doing that. I don't measure or weigh my food or count my calories at all but I do eat a very simplified diet that is low carb, high protein and fat with an occasional treat every so often along with doing about 16 hours of fasting a day mainly cause I just hate eating breakfast.

Take last week for example. 2500 mon - fri. Sat & sun = 7000 and even add an extra 1000 to adjust for mistakes. So that’s 20500.

Eating to remove hunger versus eating to prevent hunger,38,sribes,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sribes/eating_to_remove_hunger_versus_eating_to_prevent/,21,"Recently in this sub, I saw a comment where someone mentioned that they eat until they are no longer hungry, rather than eating until they feel full. This thought has really stuck with me over the past couple days and has given me an idea. Can I only eat when I feel hungry; and then, only eat enough to make that hunger feeling go away?

For the last several years I have been eating on a schedule, 6a.m., 11a.m, 5p.m. I would eat at those times whether I was hungry or not. I guess this could be considered eating to *prevent* hunger. I think for meals, this might be ok, but the real problem is snacking. Snacking to prevent hunger means I snack anytime I am bored or near the kitchen.

I am going to try to get off my schedule and switch to eating to remove hunger, rather than prevent it. The plan is:

1. Wait until I have a 'noticeable' and 'consistent' feeling of hunger.
2. Eat until that feeling goes away, and no more.

I've been trying this over the past couple of days, and while I need to keep working on it, I think there really is something here.

The biggest benefit so far is my reduction in snacking. I have not been letting myself snack unless I have a specific hunger feeling that I will notice go away.

The biggest challenge is my ability to stop eating when the  hunger feeling goes away, instead of finishing my plate. To help with this I've been putting less and less on my plate each meal.

Has anyone else tried this? If yes, do you have any advice to someone just starting out with this?",1644757856.0

My self-image and self-esteem are at rock bottom. I have never in my life felt so uncomfortable and upset in my own body.

A little backstory: I (F-20s) lost weight during the pandemic. I went from about 185lb to 136lb. I work from home and am extremely recluse so not many people have seen me during this time. Since the weightloss, I've gained a bit. I went from 136 to 153 and now am down to 146ish. And I feel horrible. 

I see 300lbs in the mirror when I look. I hate how all clothes look on me. I can only wear super baggy clothes that hide everything. I don't want anyone to ever see me and feel so much anxiety at the idea of meeting up with friends or god forbid, romantic partners. Every time I put on clothes that aren't 5 sizes too big on me, I burst into tears. I try to buy clothes aren't skin-tight or baggy but even in them, I feel terrible. I am much more sensitive to slight changes in my weight now, too. A pair of jeans was slightly loose on me a few days ago but today it felt tighter. Without even looking in the mirror, this sent me into a whole breakdown. 

I try not to look in the mirror as much because I start crying immediately when I do. But I'm about to go on vacation and then to a work conference, where I will be around a lot of people. I don't have any clothes I feel comfortable in that aren't way too big. The thought of going to the mall and buying clothes or ordering clothes online and having nothing fit well on me has me on the verge of tears alone.

So please tell me, any advice? I can't imagine I'm alone here. But I just don't know what to do.",1644795847.0

It’s been going good so far and I’ve been able to stay under 1200. However, sometimes I get really “hungry.” It’s in quotes because I’m not actually hungry, but I want to eat or feel like I need too. My stomach feels content, but not my mouth, if that makes sense. For example, I normally skip breakfast because I’m no longer hungry in the morning but I still find myself wanting to eat.

Some of you are concerned with the 1200 calorie limit. I have talked to my doctor about this. I regularly see her for check ups.

Then September came and I had to go back into the classroom again excited for a better year than last. Long story short, it wasn't. Being a teacher right now is soul sucking and exhausting. I often find find myself with no energy at the end of the day for anything other than keeping myself sustained. My house is a disaster, my boyfriend started graduate school and doesn't have as much time to help, and I don't even have time/energy for my own hobbies let alone cooking.

Then at new years, my grandmother died of Covid and I contracted it AGAIN. My boyfriend is in the process of moving in and working for his degree full time as well as working full time.

I started this year the same as every new year for the past 4 years, telling myself that after holidays would be the time to really knuckle down and get serious about losing weight. This year, to my absolute bare-arsed astonishment, it actually stuck! 44 days in and I'm not only losing weight at a decent rate, I feel my relationship to food has fundamentally changed. I can go an entire evening after eating dinner without walking to the corner shop to get a massive thing of sour gummies and liquorice lace, hell as I am sitting here there's a box of Krispy Kreme my wife bought sitting right in front of me that I've not touched a single one of. I've figured out how to include my favourites (burritos, burgers, fried chicken) into my diet while still staying within my calorie limits for the day and can even do a weekend of heavy drinking with friends if I'm especially sensible a few days leading up to it and after. My salad game is on another level and the things I can do in the dinner sphere while staying under 500 calories is worth a post of its own.

Yesterday morning I woke up and was getting ready when my wife turned and said the thread title. It was incredibly sweet, and also intensely exciting. I immediately dove into our closet and dragged out some of the clothes I'd shamefully stuffed into the back over the last 5 years of weight gain. It was the lamest little fashion show you ever did see, but god did it make me feel so good! I was shocked to find out it all fit again. I was doubly shocked to find out I must have weighed about 96kg back then so was already overweight and have been most of my adult life! Who knows how ill look when I reach goal weight.

As an aside french fries and soda being a side-dish and a drink with a meal is absolutely insane when you think about it. French fries should be a main meal, and a soda should be a dessert. What kind of insane society are we living in when you can have a 700 calorie main dish, and then top it up with like 400 calories of potato and 300 calories of drink ""to be satieted"" and then follow it with a dessert as a ""treat"" and nobody bats an eye. I really don't blame anyone for being overweight when that is drummed into us. All this sugar and fat and shit is insanely addictive, harmful and if society ever makes it to a brighter future I hope we look back at turn of the century fast food menus the same way we look back at 19th century medicine. I genuinely think there needs to be government regulation in this shit, in the same way we can't put opium into baked goods just because it feels good.

Edit: Thanks for all the help. I’m sorry that I didn’t add more about my weight loss journey. I started at 415lbs and I’m now around 285. I’ve lost the weight mostly by restricting my food intake to a healthier amount and exercising about an hour a day (mostly cardio). Although I haven’t been formally diagnosed, I believe that I do struggle with mental issues like anxiety, depression, and binge eating, which have impacted my weight and physical health throughout my life. My mental health has improved over the last year or two, which made it easier to gain motivation to lose weight, but every time I get overwhelmed or negative, I turn to food. That’s what I’m going through recently.",1644711549.0
Tip if you can't skip dessert like me.,99,sr8wn8,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sr8wn8/tip_if_you_cant_skip_dessert_like_me/,27,"I used to eat cupcakes/cakes/donuts for dessert once or twice daily.

I switched to eating candies which are surprisingly low on calories and I find provides more satisfaction per calorie. Now I eat 15 gummy bears for dessert which is 100 calories. That alone creates a deficit of 350-700 calories per day for me.

"Tips for keeping weight loss throughout the year, as a student?",1,ss1eo6,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ss1eo6/tips_for_keeping_weight_loss_throughout_the_year/,3,"Hiya, I started my weight loss journey in january 2021 and I lost 20 lbs, it's been going great... up until school started in person again last fall. Through early 2021, my weight loss went well because I could prepare healthy meals for myself and work out whenever I wanted to, without worrying about if I had time to, since I was at home most of the time. (I have a treadmill and some other small bits of equipment so that helped) 

Since school started in person again though, I regained the 20 lbs i lost and it feels like everything I've been doing just doesn't fit within my school schedule anymore. I have to eat breakfast and lunch as quickly as possible to not be late, I'm often so exhausted by the end of the day that I don't have the energy to work out, and my lunch period is so early in the day that I'm often really hungry by the time I get home, and I find myself reaching for whatever (usually unhealthy) snack is easiest and quickest.

Feeling completely hopeless...,0,ss1d45,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ss1d45/feeling_completely_hopeless/,3,"Hi, I'm u/Talent_And_Poise. I'm 25 years old and I currently weight approximately 175kgs/385lbs (I haven't weight myself in probably 4-5 months but I don't think I've changed at all). I have been overweight my entire life- or at least as far as I know, because my perception of weight & body image as a kid was only whatever the adults told me. I was a chubby baby, I was made fun of for being a chubby kid and right through to now I've never been ""skinny"" or ""thin"". I am a firm believe of self love & every size is beautiful. I grew up in a household where my mum talked about putting me on Weight Watchers at 12 & my sisters would make me do hardcore workouts and tell me to only eat salads. My relationship with food & weight is completely fucked if I'm being totally honest. Because of my upbrining and the damage it has caused to my mental health, I never want to make anyone ever believe they need to look a certain way or weigh a certain amount. I don't believe that of myself either...  


However, I am now 25 years old & married. I want to have children and I want to be able to run with them, play with them & birth them comfortably. I want to make sure that I can encourage and foster them to have a healthy relationship with food. I have been having issues with my periods, they are so irregular and even sometimes non-existent. I have gone months without a period & I don't think I am ovulating. I don't really know what else could be having that impact except my weight & lifestyle. I desperately want to change. I want to feel better physically. I want my body to function as best as it can. I want to be truly taking care of myself and heal my relationship with my body & food.  


I feel like every week I tell myself ""this is the moment where everything changes."" and yet I never change. I am conflicted between being body positive & HAES but wanting to lose weight for actual physical health benefits. Because realistically I am NOT healthy at this size. Am I surviving? Yes. Could I be happy living like this? Probably. Do I think I am beautiful & that I would be a great mother regardless of my size? Absolutely. But could I be happy knowing if I continue like this that I might be missing out on so much more and that I have so much potential but I'm just too lazy to live up to it?....No.   


Gosh... I don't really know where this is all going but I suppose I wanted to ask if there is anyone out there that has felt this way before and has jumped that mental hurdle and lost the weight, how did you do it? How did you change your mindset? How did you make sure you were nourishing yourself and losing weight as well? Whenever I think about weightloss my mind just immediately jumps to extremes. I don't know how to come to terms with the ""slow and steady"" approach. How do you stay patient and focused?   


Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",1644811462.0
Weight Plateau,6,srp5jz,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srp5jz/weight_plateau/,8,"Hi all! 

I'm F/5'4/138lb. 

I've been struggling with a 15lb fat loss for a while now. I initially began as a skinny-fat body type but was technically at my lowest (and no real muscle mass) at 116\~120lb. I am now  plateaued at 138-140. 

\[NSFW\]

[https://imgur.com/IOHm8Uo](https://imgur.com/IOHm8Uo)

Since my initial journey in 2020, I've gained muscle but it's very apparent I still have gained fat as well and it's very frustrating as it feels like no matter what I do, it's not coming off. (I base this largely off my former fat content on my face -- I get chubby cheeks). 

I'm currently on a CICO method with 1650-1850 (depending on activity levels) as I typically burn average of 2300 cal per day. I weight train 5x week, typically always achieve over 10k steps, and I've been doing my best to ensure what I'm consuming are whole foods.

Macro tracking is based on 130g Protein/150-200g Carbs/60g Fat. 

However, my relationship with food has also dealt with turbulence along the way bulimia (ED) and binge eating habits that will sometimes surface every now and then. I've also done long fasts and tried the 1200 cal method which exacerbated the entire eating disorder to begin with, oops. would not recommend. I have gone through coaches, therapists and am doing a lot better than where I was a year ago but this is still something that is weighing me down. literally.

In addition to this, I do take creatine on most weekdays but sometimes I miss it for a week or two, making the numbers incredibly fluctuated and difficult to see what my actual progress is.

Lastly, I've got no idea how many lbs of muscle I've actually gained since I began this journey. It is very apparent that my body has changed but I wouldn't inflate the numbers to just muscle mass. For example, my 'booty gains' are on fire: \[NSFW\]

This is also where I am right now (give or take) since my journey began:

[https://imgur.com/a/ri2glRm](https://imgur.com/a/ri2glRm)

Nonetheless, I'm still struggling to iron out the last '15lbs' (or even just 10, I WILL SETTLE FOR 10). 

Does anyone have any advice? Some days, it feels like I haven't even made a single bit of progress, honestly. Those days are more prone to binging patterns. 

Thank you for listening to my rant though.

Struggling with weight loss since I started to work full time.,3,sru36j,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sru36j/struggling_with_weight_loss_since_i_started_to/,5,"I am a 32 year old man, 182cm tall and currently at 110kg. My goal weight is 93kg for now.

I have been lifting weights since I was 17 with some breaks, so I have a good amount of muscle and am reasonably strong. Current routine is lifting 3 times per week in my home gym.

But the weight really started being a problem for me in the last couple of years. I was a fat kid until I lost weight and started doing martial arts and gym in high school and college. I was competitive on amateur level, weighed in about 90-95kg and felt really strong and looked decent without much effort regarding the diet.

But ever since starting to work full time at 25 it has became a struggle. I stopped doing martial arts because the effort was incompatible with the effort that I already have to expend at work. I am constantly in cycles of gaining and losing weight. I also never seem to reach my goal or even stay at 100kg for long. I usually am more active in the warm months - cycling, walks, etc... and then gain that weight back in the winter when I am less active.

It is very annoying and I am unsure what to do about this. I generally prepare the food by myself and log it into MFP. But then there is this ""mindless"" state where I just catch myself binging on ice cream or some other candy, that I don't like that much... Usually triggered by some stress about work or taxes or something like that... Or I take a walk with a friend and just say fuck it and buy a bag of chips or something...

One more thing I noted: I feel much worse when in calorie deficit than when I was younger. Deficit of around 500-1000 calories that were bearable before now bring out anxiety and usually make me binge. Even with 500 calorie deficit on a clean diet, and I constantly feel hungry.

I am not sure how to get out of this cycle for good... advice is more than welcome!",1644789272.0

https://imgur.com/gallery/2O6Qvyf

I've been putting this off, but I think I'm finally ready to accept that I did it. 

I haven't weighed less than 225 in over 30 years, so it's taking some time to realize that I actually did what I've wanted to do for so long. 

My spouse started all of this, because he loves acting and wanted to get the ""attractive lead"" roles. I wouldn't be posting here if it weren't for him. (He lost 150lbs.)

He's an excellent cook, and he started to focus more on cooking our meals rather than eating out. He kept finding healthier options and we started feeling a little better. I want to encourage you to start small too; it's easier to make the changes last if you tackle them slowly. At no point did we say, ""I will never eat [yummy, high calorie food] again!"" He looked for small ways to reduce calories without sacrificing flavor. We were at this phase for a few months. 

Then, I was bored and suggested we go for a walk. We walked just 30 minutes that first day. In a few months, we were walking 2 miles every day in an hour. We'd just have dinner, go walk, then do our thing. It was so easy, I never believed I'd see much results from it. 

We monitored our progress through a fitness watch and a fitness app. It was important to us to build a habit of being conscious of our intake and output. So, strict CICO and a 4 mile walk every day is where the magic happened. 

I want to point out that this has been as much of a mental shift as it has been physical. About 4 months into daily walks, I caught myself thinking, ""Man, I needed this today. I was so stressed, and this feels great."" I had gone from punishing myself with exercise to treating myself with it. I really do encourage you to find the movement that makes you feel like this. Your body *wants* to be healthy and you can find a way to get there.

Here we are 2 years later. I haven't stepped in a gym and maybe ate a handful of salads and not one damn grapefruit!

Other victories along the way include:

Stopped smoking - never had wanted to quit before, but it seemed stupid to keep it up while trying to improve my health. 

Stopped taking antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, and opiates. I'd say the primary reason for this is my medical marijuana prescription, but losing weight absolutely contributed to my not needing those things as well. 

Stopped destructive behavior - for me, gaming is destructive. I can sit in chair and plant turnips on my phone game for 15 hours and not notice time. I got rid of my gaming rig and now  spend that time walking or with family. 

Current struggles: Oh, nothing too big, just a small existential crisis now that no one recognizes me. Because I lost a whole person during Covid and started a new job...no one from my fat life knows me until I speak. Even then, they still keep sneaking glances like they just can't believe it. 

And, a constant struggle to believe that pretty woman in the mirror is me. She looks like a nice person though, so maybe we'll eventually get along. :-}

In 2021, I lost 15kg from extreme weight loss plans. I'm a student, so I did not know what healthy weight loss was, and I searched up the ""fastest way"" to lost weight, which included no carbs at all, only vegetables, and 10 days of not eating at all. I also exercised 3-4 hours of cardio everyday. 

Within 1.5 months, I lost 15kg and was happy with it. 

NOTE: NOW I KNOW THIS IS EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY. 

Fast forward a month later, I found it hard to control this type of diet, and when university started for me, all the stress and work came toppling on me which caused me to go into a binge eating spree. 

Within 1 month, I gained everything that I lost back, and although my body shape didn't change much because I exercised, the weight is still high up in numbers. 

From then on, I tried ""focusing"" on weight loss, but I just didn't want to put on all that effort because I was so tired with all the work I had. Another fast forward 1 year later, I keep on saying that I'm on a diet, but I'm not losing weight at all. Instead, I keep gaining, and I know VERY well of what I need to do, but I'm lazy, and I'm tired. I'm completely back to my original shape due to not exercising because I was too busy.

In 2021, I was able to lose weight because I've been staying at home, I had the time and the effort to do weight loss. But now I'm so stressed with school, and I have a terrible case of insomina, I'm continuously gaining weight. 

I stress eat, and I'm trying to tone it down right now, and I know I want to lose weight, I just can't find any motivation anymore. I'm not happy with the way I am, nor am I mutual because I keep beating myself up when I see the scale. 

I'm completely on the phase where I want to lose weight, but I'm just making excuses due to stress and many more.

Other than the fact swimming would protect my joints and count as cardio, are there any other benefits to it I should be aware of ? Tickets and membership to my pool are more expensive than the gym, so I need all the arguments I can get to push myself (the fact that I have to attend a friend's wedding in June is already motivation, as I have not seen her in five years and woould like to tone up before, but more motivation is always welcome).

Food-wise, I plan on tracking and trying to eat lower-carb overall, as I have noticed it suits my body better.",1644772587.0

Stationary bike vs treadmill,3,srmwrh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srmwrh/stationary_bike_vs_treadmill/,18,"I’m looking for personal experiences on treadmills vs stationary bikes like Peloton that offer programs for weight loss. 

I’m at my highest weight, as is my husband. I’m done complaining but not doing anything about it. It’s time to change. 

Gyms are hard because of our work schedules and our kids. So we’ve agreed on either a peloton type bike or a treadmill. 

I’ve seen people talk about successfully losing weight with a treadmill program that does high incline and medium speed. He feels like a peloton would be more interactive, more fun, and we’d be more likely to use it. Plus it would fit in our living area where as a treadmill would have to be in a separate room. 

If anyone would like to share experience with either or both, I’d appreciate it.

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 13, 2022",7,srg91i,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srg91i/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_13_2022/,1,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

I'm really afraid of loose skin.

I've been overweight my entire life, but recently gained about 30lbs due to some pretty bad health issues. 

My weight distribution is pretty proportionate, I gain evenly everywhere. I know this is probably a good thing, but it makes me so worried that if I do have a lot of extra skin, I'll need surgery everywhere, rather than just on my stomach. 


Right now I'm losing about 1.5lbs per week, which is right where I want to be. I do strength training primarily, with cardio and yoga mixed in. I eat healthy and get lots of fruits and veggies. I also avoid the sun or wear sunscreen when I'm out for more than 15 minutes, and I moisturize and drink lots of water. 

I'm just so afraid I'll get to my end goal weight and then require tons of surgery. I'm terrified of having to undergo those procedures and I couldn't afford to anyway. I don't want to lose all this weight and put years of effort in to end up feeling self-conscious being naked. I know that a little bit is probably unavoidable, and that doesn't scare me (I know it'll tighten a bit over time), but I'm afraid of having huge amounts of noticeable skin that require really scary surgeries to fix. 


Has anyone else lost a similar amount of weight loss and not had a lot of extra skin? Is there anything more I can do to minimize it? I'm really letting my anxiety get the best of me here and could really use some reassurance. Thank you.",1644773613.0

Lost some weight and want to put muscle on,2,srnp9z,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srnp9z/lost_some_weight_and_want_to_put_muscle_on/,4," 

Hello all.

Here are my current stats: 183cm and 94kg, BMI of 28 and am 18.

I lost around 20kg over the course of about 2 months in the summer \*started on 110kg), and between the summer and now I have gained and around 4kg and maintained it (just eating normally, no cutting, no major exercise, the usual walk to the shop and uni, etc). About 10 days ago I joined the gym and have been going around 4-5 times a week and doing a bit of running, cycling and working on the weight machine. Yesterday I also started a bit of lift weighting, just with the dumbbells, the ""normal basic"" workout.

I look good compared to what I looked like before, and can run quite fast and for longer periods of times than before and feel overall quite great. However, I still somewhat of a belly and want to cut it out.

My question is, do I go on a calorie deficit again to try to lose more weight, or do I just eat normally and consume the right amount of protein in order to gain muscles? Also, what are the best exercises for a beginner like me? I've mostly been doing the machine workouts because they are straight-forward and not very busy, but I know they aren't the best. How should I prioritise my gym workout to gain some muscle/lose the fat?

Thank you all in advance!",1644772795.0

My sedentary TDEE is 1480, my current diet is 1280. In the past I did struggle a bit with restricting/binging (disordered eating tendencies) so this was something important for me to try.

So yesterday I ate whatever I felt like eating, trying to listen to my body's needs and not feel guilty about anything I ate. I didn't track anything for the whole day. I'm also on my period so kinda extra challenging lol.

I did track today what I had yesterday. With my estimations I stayed on the higher end and I'm positive it's fairly accurate.

Result: 1563 calories consumed (154.9 gr. carbs, 86.1 gr. fats, 50.6 gr protein)

What I ate: breakfast: two slices of whole food cornbread with a homemade spread that consisted of half an avocado, some mayo and spices mixed in, lunch: rice with vegetables, a bit of grated cheese, spices, dinner: a nice salad with feta, lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes, oil, vinegar, spices caloric snacks: 2 teas with milk and sugar, 1 protein yoghurt.

I definitely can work on my protein intake (I'm vegetarian) maybe if i ditched the mayo and had a boiled egg instead or so. Anyways I think being only 83 calories over TDEE is pretty good? If i wouldn't have had any sugar in my tea I would have been almost exactly at my TDEE!

Definitely will continue to track for a while before I get a better feeling things out and it was a nice experiment that I definitely will try again and this experience makes me hopeful that I can probably keep the weight off especially if I incorporate more exercising!

Should I up my calories to make my cut smoother?,2,sri4v1,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sri4v1/should_i_up_my_calories_to_make_my_cut_smoother/,6,"Hey guys, my current goal is to lose a couple kilos to get a bit leaner before starting to lean bulk.

The only issue that I have is perhaps going too low with the calories. Right now I'm eating around 1600 calories and for reference I'm a male, 26yo, 71kg,180cm and I workout 4 days a week. 

Based on what calculators say, my tdee should be around 2600kcal a day, so that's quite a big deficit I have. 

I got to a point where my current 1600 cal diet is perfectly sustainable and I have no problem sticking to it but I was questioning if i should up my calories a bi or not. I've read around that too big of a deficit may be counterproductive, both for muscle gain and weight loss due to a metabolism slowdown.

What do you guys think? Would it be a better idea for my weightloss to up the calories? 

Thank you in advance!",1644757243.0
Just started - is this suistainable?,2,srhqil,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/srhqil/just_started_is_this_suistainable/,2,"Hi everyone.

Just started my own weight loss journey this week on  Monday, and now 7 days in want to sanity check what I'm doing, because I find so much different information, and receive so much different advice.

To start off with, when I stepped on my scales Monday morning they said ""122.2kg"". This is the heaviest I have ever been and is what triggered the want for change (well, about a week before that to be honest).

I have never done any form of diet before. I have done the occasional mental exercise of ""just don't stuff so much food in your mouth"" - but never anything planned out.

I found a meal pack service that sends out all the meals for you for a week at a time. 3 meals a day, + 2 snacks. 1200-1500 kcal per day. The first day I was being a bit stupid, and just had that. Turned out to be a very low amount of kcal that day, just 1200, and on Tuesday I felt like absolute shit. From then I took a more sensible approach, ate the included things, but then added to it with some fruit and stuff (bananas, apples and avocados) to hit 1500-1600 kcal per day. I have read that someone my weight shouldn't have less than 1550 kcal per day as the minimum.

With around 1600kcal per day, I have actually felt amazing. I'm not at any point super hungry but feel ""appropriately"" hungry when food time comes around. Compare that to my old way of eating 1-2 massive meals per day, where I only had two modes: not hungry (but can still eat if someone offers me food) and ravaging starving.

The result of the first 6 days has been that this morning the scales said 117.9kg. 4,3kg weight loss. That sounds high to me, but I understand that that is mostly water weight and quite normal for the first week or so when losing weight.

Now, sorry for the long post, I just realized how much I've typed. My question is this:

Considering that this so far has made me feel great (more energy, and I also sleep better) while losing a significant amount of weight, does this seem sustainable? Is this healthy? And what kind of results can I expect from this long term? While seeing the kg's fall off on the scale on a daily basis has certainly been a mood boost this week, I understand that is not how it will work all the time, so what is reasonable expectations?

I have been overweight since my teenage years, and morbidly obese since my early 20's, so I'm not looking for a miracle cure, but a long term plan that I can hold to in order to at some point go below 100kg, and then further towards 80kg.

This is my second time in life I’ve shown significant weight loss by employing the calorie deficit method. I eat 1250 calories a day, and burn 1900-2000. This has lost me about 10 lbs in the last 2 months. 

typically, I get on my scale every 2-3 days and see weight loss. But today was the first time I gained (just about 0.6 of a pound). 

Yesterday I was extremely active and burned 3k calories and ate my usual 1250. I assumed I’d see a weight drop today. Not gain.

Could I have done something wrong? Are there other factors that can play into weight gain? (For example- a females cycle)

This last week I got serious and actually started watching what I eat, worked out etc and lost 2 lbs, which is on target but after that first week rush of losing (probably mostly water)  weight, it still feels like a letdown. 

Also my energy level the last two week has been flagging, I assume because my body is getting used to having to work for energy instead of being awash in carbs.

At 18, I was just over 11st (154-157lbs) until I started a physical job at a warehouse and I could eat whatever I wanted and I still lost weight to around 10st (140lbs give or take a few pounds).

My weight remained stable until I made some dietary changes where I cut out my diet fizzy drinks and started eating whole grain alternatives to pasta/rice/bread. 

I never really weighed myself consistently and just went off on how my clothes fitted. 

18 months ago I weighed myself and I realised that I was under 9st  (my bmi was borderline underweight) and with a few other symptoms I went to the doctors and was told it was probably a combination of stress and too many hours at work after blood tests showed nothing of concern. 

Since then, I’ve kept my dietary changes with the no fizzy drinks and whole grain alternatives wherever possible and have been gaining weight since then. 

I took up cycling last year and it’s more of a mental well being kinda thing with the added bonus of it being physically active (I do around 30ish miles on the weekend at a steady pace with occasional hill climbs and sprints). 

The thing is, I weighed myself this week and I’m at 147lbs (10st 7) but I can just about fit into my clothes from when I was under 9st. 

Obviously cycling has helped with muscle building as well as my job but I don’t understand on how I’ve nearly gained 20lbs in 18 months and I still fit in clothes from when I was borderline underweight, while my bmi is currently edging towards the “overweight” category.

Even if you went back in time, you’d still end up exactly where you are now because that old version of you didn’t learn to develop healthy, long-lasting habits. 

The only version of yourself you should idealize is your present self, because that’s the only person who can actually influence your life. When you do lose the weight, you’ll look back at pictures of yourself now with love and pride, being grateful for how hard you worked on improving yourself. 

Don’t use your weight loss journey as an excuse to postpone your life. Take pictures of yourself, go to events, do whatever you would do if you were at your goal weight. Life’s too short to wait to live it until you have reached a certain number.

EDIT: First of all thank you to every single person who awarded and commented on my post, I appreciate your insight and I'm elated to hear that this post was encouraging to some of you. I can see now that the way I worded my post may come off as strong, if anything it was just a reminder to myself and others in the same situation as me. I did not mean that you should not appreciate, or even try to learn from your past self. That's why I used the word IDEALIZE, because it is easy to distort the past and use it to make oneself feel guilty about the present. What I meant was that you shouldn't use the fact that you were thinner before as a way to bully, or shame yourself for having gained weight. I can understand that some people may be in a different situation to me, where their weight gain is not a result of bad habits, or that they may derive a lot of value from looking back and examining how they maintained their lower weight. In that case this post is not really applicable to your situation. The people I mean to address are those who already have strong feelings of guilt and shame surrounding recent weight gain and feel paralyzed by it. This is something I used to do, spending hours looking at old pictures of myself, causing me to feel even more demotivated about losing weight.In that case, obsessing about the person you used to be can be detrimental to moving on and looking forward. I wish all of you the best of luck on your journey.",1644599948.0

MyFitnessPal has turned to crap over the past 6 years imho. Ads are now so intrusive it's impossible to use without accidentally tapping an ad- I find that very unscrupulous, I don't want to reward whoever current owns it for that. I just tried a calorie tracker that has good reviews on the app store, but nags the user constantly to buy the premium version- *which, on the surface, I'm not opposed to, in fact my preference is to pay a little for the app and be done with it, if that's what it takes-* but no way in hell am I going to pay for another damned subscription to something.

My requirements, thus, are:

-good accurate database. Not a lot of spurious data like MyFitnessPal

-ability to save custom meals or recipes

-track activity calories as well as food

-obviously, keep a daily diary

-set a weightloss goal

-scan barcodes

 -NO ADS -premium or pro version that I pay for is fine

-NO SUBSCRIPTIONS

-would be nice to share data with other users but not a requirement

I'm this close to nicking all the calorie data for my typical diet and making my own simple app.

I went 28 days alcohol free in January, I felt so fucking good it's unbelievable. I was working out dropping weight and just feeling really well in myself, yeah I had cravings for alcohol but I was fine.

Then comes 2 weeks holiday off work, I was getting drunk(black out drunk) every 2 days and on the day I was hung over I would order takeaway and binge on that. I gained all the weight I lost in the 28 days I stayed sober I just feel so defeated but I'm starting again (well started 2 days ago).

I just think when it comes to alcohol, I just can't have a cheeky beer or 2, it becomes 3, 4, 5 and then half a bottle of JD later I'm on my arse.

"Learn the difference between “treating yourself” and “ruining your progress.” Cheat meals don’t have to be cheat days, and cheat meals don’t even have to be bad.",907,sq3sh7,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq3sh7/learn_the_difference_between_treating_yourself/,71,"Last night I went out to eat with some friends. The restaurant we went to had healthy options that were also delicious. 

Knowing I was going out, I structured my day so that my earlier meals were smaller than usual anyway, to balance the calories. But even so, I still chose an entree that was grilled and not fried, featured colorful veggies, and was a good portion - filling, but not overindulgence. And I even took some leftovers home, which I’m enjoying for lunch right now.

I could have easily called yesterday a wash, and eaten regular meals with some extra treats because “I’m going out - whatever! No diet today!” And I have in the past. *But health is not a diet. Health is a lifestyle.*

Instead, I enjoyed an amazing meal with friends, and felt no guilt or sickness from overeating. Additionally, I didn’t under-order. I didn’t say “just a small salad,” as many dieters might be tempted to do. You can still eat a full meal and be healthy.

The main points of my post, for those who might take something positive from it coming into Super Bowl weekend in America:

- If you know that an unhealthy meal is coming, scale back your portions of other meals throughout the day without starving yourself.

- When you are treating yourself, remember that you can still enjoy extra food that isn’t the healthiest without gorging. Enjoy it, eat until you’re full, and stop. You’ll thank yourself for it.

- Leftovers are wonderful.

4 week Full liquid diet as pre surgical prep/weight loss,3,sr6msy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sr6msy/4_week_full_liquid_diet_as_pre_surgical/,5,"It was supposed to be 5 weeks but I kept cheating this last week.

Background:

I'm a 41 year old trans woman and 3 years ago tomorrow I had a sleeve gastrectomy. My HW was 460 pounds 4 years ago before preparing for surgery. Since WLS I've gotten as low as 215 right after my FDL abdominoplasty July 2020. Last January I had an extended arm lift and BA/BL. I started eating things I shouldn't eat much (or at all per my WLS doc) especially this past holiday season  and regained to almost 260. Can't get out to workout the way I do best (roller/trail skating) for the weather and really dislike doing routine videos other than stretching. 


Anyway, on March 7 I'm finally getting the surgery this was all for; I'm having bottom surgery (vaginoplasty). The surgeon says I'm GTG at a 32 BMI which for me is 236. My scale is reading 248 now which is down already because other than snacking my only meals the last week were high protein shakes. 

In my experience my doctor's scale reads heavier than my home scale. For my own reassurance; and to avoid a BM post-op for a while, I'm going on a <500 calorie/day diet to lose the last few pounds. I'm also working out more as the weather and temperature improve. I'm doing a few miles 'run' in my skates around my neighborhood or a Greenway I like 75 minutes away; I do half marathons there. Bought a bike for days I can't skate, but can get to a Greenway I like for biking only 45 minutes away. 

I'm sure with the shape I'm in the surgeon won't cancel me day of. But after 16 years and thinking I'd never get here; I have to be proactive. I couldn't do this without having had WLS TBH, but it's still not easy.


I feel like I'm rambling and not even sure why I decided to make this post other than maybe somewhere to share and get encouragement to make it through these first (and hardest) days of not eating any solids.

I Need Help...,2,sr61gy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sr61gy/i_need_help/,17,"Hey Everyone, 

I need help. I'm (hopefully) going to be starting a company this year (late 2022) and I'll probably be on camera a bit because of it. I have horrendous habits that I drastically need changed before then. 

First, I am ADDICTED to soda. Mainly Diet Dew. Literally drink a 12 pack of cans roughly a day. I know it's terrible for me and has next to no nutritional value, but I genuinely can't quit it. I've tried numerous times and failed numerous times more. I need to cut that completely out of my life. I have 1 kidney and tons of medical issues; you'd think THAT alone would be incentive enough to cut it out but... apparently not. 

Second, I am decently overweight. I'm 285lbs and want to shed at least 85 of those lbs. I wanna get back down to my slim size I was in High School. Problem is, I am very out of shape (for obvious reasons). Everytime I try and work out, I end up quitting in about 15 minutes and I am very lightheaded. Sometimes I throw up afterwards for over exerting myself maybe? I don't know. But it's difficult to do anything without huffin and puffin afterwards. 

Third, I eat like absolute garbage. Everytime I try and build up the desire or courage to cook something, I burn it or talk myself out of it and go down to McDonalds or Subway and get something. Bad food. Nothing but trash. I love healthy foods too! I love fruits and vegetables! I love eggs! All that stuff! But it's just quicker and more convenient for my dumb brain to go get something quick and disgusting. My problem is also moderation too. I don't just get one burger, I'll get two. I am overall just a mess. 

So, I eat poorly, can't exercise because I eat poorly, and drink disgusting carbonated beverages that are probs killing me faster. I want to live a healthier lifestyle so bad, but I've tried so many times and failed so many times. On top of everything else, everytime I try and do something that'll help me, I fail and then my family condescends me for failing and being like ""why do you even try""? 

I could really use an accountabilibuddy or a Fitness Friend that could basically coach me and keep an eye on me and make sure I don't fall of the wagon. Someone preferably that won't condescend me and ridicule me for trying.

I know a healthy person shouldn't eat more than 2 or 3 slices of pizza but I don't see how this is possible once you start.

For reference I am male 25 , 60.5kg (133lbs) 5'11 and my highest weight was 111kg (244lbs). I lost the weight by keto but I no longer follow that diet, maybe I should go back to it.

I eat around 1500 calories on a sedentary day and up to 1900 when active. My diet is low carb, lots of vegetables and fruit. I eat enough food, I am not losing weight, so why do I feel the need to binge?

I probably binge at least 2x a week and then I restrict after to make up for it. And I know this is bad but I have made myself sick after binges a few times, but it was horrible and I won't do it again.

Yesterday I binged. I ate 20 chilli cheese bites and two vegan whoppers from burger king and fries. Total calories like 2500. Also I had eaten some fruit earlier so extra 100cal

The worst thing about it was that I didn't even feel bad physically after I binged. If anything I felt BETTER??? (Until the later stomach upset of course...) Mentally I was in pieces but how can I trust myself if overeating actually makes me feel better??

No food for me today except a couple of bananas. Why do I do this to myself?? 

I need to stop this before it gets out of control and I gain all the weight back but it feels so difficult to control :(",1644685893.0

I've been overweight/obese all my life and I've never worn anything smaller than an XL/XXL. I'm tall and lift weights so I generally thought I carried it well... But you all know how it goes, I've still had confidence issues etc etc ad infinitum.

Well, My big brother died of Covid during the first wave. One of the first in my area. He was 38 and it was his weight that did it. He was much, much heavier than I was, but that was his primary health concern. Otherwise, he was fine and dandy. I don't have a big family, just my mum and dad really and despite being the youngest I've aways been the go to support. So, naturally, I moved across the country to be closer to them and help them as much as I could (thank goodness for wfh). Unfortunately a lack of kitchen essentials in my new digs and  general stress munching meant I ate nothing but takeaways... Looking back it was actually nuts. As you can imagine, I piled on the the weight like you wouldn't believe. Over the course of the year I went from 17 stone (238FrU, 108kg) to 20 stone (280FrU, 127 kg), if I'm being kind to myself. 

This was before vaccines came along to save the day and it got to the point that I was genuinely scared that I would be seriously ill if I caught covid. The thought of doing that to my parents kicked me into touch and I started looking after myself.

Since then I've quit smoking and I've lost 6.5 stone (91FrU, 41kg), but I honestly don't see it in myself. Intellectually, I know I'm much smaller. I've seen photos side by side yada yada. I've also nearly toppled over picking up a weight I could have thrown around a year and a half ago. It didn't really hit me until today though.

I have a job which takes me to different sites and they provide PPE. I had my first visit in a while today and when I arrived the guy greeting me threw me a jacket. I put it on, zipped it up without thinking twice and went off on my merry way. Afterwards I took it off, looked at the tag and it was a medium. A fucking medium... And it fit like a bit of a baggy glove. Mental. Never could I have imagined I'd fit into a medium.

Tracking my calories again has been so eye-opening. I have been using MyFitnessPal and I can't believe how many calories I consume just from snacking! A few pretzel rods here and a muffin there doesn't feel like a lot of food but that accounted for over 400 calories yesterday! 

Even if you don't calorie count for the long term, tracking for a few days can really make you aware of bad habits/calorie-bombs!

One of my triggers/guilty pleasures is eating chips & dip when my partner goes out of town. 😬 So i knew when hes gone this weekend that would be ALL i could think about and in order to prevent me from making a bad last minute decision i figured i should just set my self up for a prepared okay decision so..

I bought the chips (more cal friendly than ruffles), instead of sour cream i subbed 0% greek yogurt, and ive been eating below my goal calories the last few days to also offset. 

All in all im staying within my deficit, but also acknowledging and easing my trigger. But i still feel like im getting away with something!",1644632328.0
Question about the benefits of exercise,1,sr67tg,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sr67tg/question_about_the_benefits_of_exercise/,17,I have recently started a low-carb diet and have been successful with it so far. I have also started some light exercise 3 to 4 times a week. I am lifting weights and walking on a treadmill. However when I started looking into how many calories i actually burn by walking on the treadmill I was discouraged. For my weight I’m only burning like 80 calories a mile! Are there other benefits of walking that will help me lose weight? I know lifting weights is good because the more muscle mass you have The more calories you burn. I’m just unsure if walking is a good use of my time,1644714369.0
Not losing weight on Phentermine,0,sr5ykk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sr5ykk/not_losing_weight_on_phentermine/,11,"Hi! 
I started to take 15mg and in a month I lost 10 pounds. Great! I stopped using it for almost a month and I didn’t gain because I always have  healthy habits. I did another half month on 15mg and I didn’t lose. This past week I started with 30mg and so far I lost maybe 2 pounds in a week. I exercise 2x or 3x a week. I eat not more than 1500cal. I logged everything I eat on MyFitnessPal and I am starting a diet with a dietitian to see what I might be doing wrong in what I think I do right. 
I am also taking L-tyrosine because I read that it can boost the phentermine effects. 

Any ideas why I am not losing the last pounds?

What’s the point if I’ll just gain it all back again?,14,sqowr5,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqowr5/whats_the_point_if_ill_just_gain_it_all_back_again/,23,"5 6 male CW: 211 GW 155

So I’ve gained and lost 60 pounds like three times and once again I have gained all the weight I lost back.

I know I should lose weight for health reasons and self esteem but it almost seems pointless. In all likelihood I’ll just gain it back again. I did good this last cycle with trying to form “lifestyle” changes. I played basketball daily and counted all my calories. But clearly they weren’t as permanent as I’d have liked them to be.

Any advice or encouragement?

As of today I'm ~22lb down from Jan 1,339,sq3g65,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq3g65/as_of_today_im_22lb_down_from_jan_1/,45,"This is going to be long-winded AF and I apologize lol. I sectioned it so y'all can skip over the background if you want. I'm not sure how important it is to anyone other than me, but I wanted it there for context. I haven't really shared about this journey to anyone yet.

**Background:**

I've been struggling with my weight my whole life. I started binging around the age of 13 - we went from being Poor to being Less Poor and we'd have more junk around, but my siblings would tear through it before I got any and I'd start hoarding food or eating multiple packs of things at a time to try and ""get my share"". I was bullied relentlessly (by my own family) for my weight and it only made things worse. From high school to the end of college I swayed between 170 and 200 lbs. 200 was my ""NO"" point back then, where I'd make a change and come back down. Usually very unhealthily. During & after college my bipolar disorder really started coming to the forefront. I'd go through periods of mania where I'd be Go Go Go and forgetting to eat, and then much looooongggerrrrr periods of depression where all I did was eat and sleep. I got up to 220, back down to 170, then up to 240, then down to 190. For a few years I managed to stay between 180-190 and then in 2016 everything went off the rails. Within 8 months I went from 180 up to 260. 80lbs in 8 months. I was depressed and consuming takeout multiple times a day, drinking soda like it was my lifeline, and bingeing on alcohol. My clothes got tighter, but I was working remotely and mostly wearing sweatpants and giant t-shirts. I didn't even notice the gain right away, and when I finally did (when I tried to put on jeans to leave the house for once) I was devastated but I was sure I couldn't be higher than 225. I went to the Dr. a month later and was shocked when the scale told me the truth.

Since then I've gone through more periods of loss and periods of gain. I've never made it lower than 230 since though. Something always happens around that point that just.... breaks everything. 

As true and functional as CICO is, when I did it I became so obsessed with the numbers. Weighing out every gram of every single thing I put into my body. I was so hyperfocused on it that every single meal took an extra 10-20 minutes to prepare. And I'd think about food alllllllll day long - planning and re-planning and craving. I was still eating with variety, but I was miserable about it. I'd feel guilty if I even came close to hitting my calorie threshold for the day. And if I went over I would spiral. Just something in my disordered brain that latched on to CICO in a really negative way. And then one day I'd finally crack and have a ""cheat day"". And then the cheat days became more often because it felt really good to not have to think so hard. For a few months I tried to do it healthily, but that lapsed. Then the pandemic started. And - unrelated to it - my brother died. And then my dad. Within a single year. So..... it was rough.

In April/May of last year I had a bit of a mental breakdown. I ended up in a partial hospitalization program for 4 weeks. 5 days a week, 8 hours a day, of nurses and doctors and social workers and group therapy and skill workshops. And I started to heal. I started talking about things I had never vocalized to anyone. I got put on good meds. I learned ways to cope that weren't food. But I wasn't ready to change my eating habits yet.

Between June - Dec I was basically status quo. I'd have food delivered 5-7 times a week. I was guzzling diet soda like it was water (literally from waking to falling asleep, 6 cans a day, often instead of water). I was completely sedentary. 

And in December I decided I was tired. Tired of being this person. Who is she? How is she me? Why am I living like this?

On Christmas I didn't take home any leftovers. My mom shoved bags and tupperwares at me and I refused. She kept insisting - ""I can't eat all of this you need to take some"". And I looked at her and got so mad and said ""You don't get to call me fat and then tell me to take a bunch of food and sweets and candy home."" She looked like I slapped her. I don't think I've ever confronted her like that before. Told me ""I never call you fat"" (lie) and ""I'm just worried about your health."" And I said ""Oh yes, lindt truffles and mini cheesecakes, the picture of health."" And started saying my goodbyes and left.

**Dec 26 - Today: A Fresh Start**

It started with buying plates. Plastic, sectioned plates from Target. A half section and two quarter sections. Every meal, even my takeout that week, was portioned out into 1/2 veg, 1/4 carb/starch, 1/4 protein. I even ordered side orders of steamed veg to make sure it would work (and didn't realize til now how much veg is neglected at restaurants - honestly wtf??? So many places where the only veg option is a salad. And not even a GOOD salad.) For a week that's what I did. On Jan 1 I changed gears.

I got on the scale. I took all my measurements. Every day I check my weight. I only record the days where it goes down, because I know it's going to fluctuate with water and hormones and weirdness, and I know if it goes too long without a general downward trajectory that it's a yellow flag for me to look closer at what I'm doing. But recording the lows gives me a better sense of the downward trends. I only take my measurements the first of every month though. From Jan - Feb I lost an inch off most of my measurements, almost 3 off my natural waist, and almost 2 off my waist at my belly button.

I started doing better grocery shopping. Pork and chicken instead of beef. An insane amount of fresh and frozen veg. Some ready meal options (canned soup, frozen meals with 250-500 calories). Snacky stuff. Even some low cal ice cream sandwiches and ghirardelli chocolate squares for when my sweet tooth shows up.

I started walking every day. Sometimes I only go outside and walk around the building. Sometimes I walk a mile, mile and a half. I've started discovering new loops and distances. But no matter how long or short of a walk it is - if I put on my jeans and shoes and go outside and move my body, I count it. It's more than nothing. If it's way too cold or inclement weather I skip - and I let myself feel okay about it instead of guilting and name calling myself. The only day so far that I've skipped without it being inclement weather was the day after I went on a 4 mile hike with my sister and my calves and thighs were screaming. I figured I earned that rest, and the next day I got right back to it.

I found that if I eat too early in the day I either feel sick or I spend all day feeling hungry, so I started basically doing a 16/8 IF without planning it that way. I go for my walk at lunch when it's warmest, I come back and eat a small meal around 1, I have a snack around 3-4, I cook dinner around 7 and I have an icecream sandwich or 2 ghirardelli squares for dessert at 9. Then I brush my teeth so the rest of my night is just water.

I've cooked dinner 37 of the last 41 days. The 4 that I got takeout, I ordered very differently than I used to. I basically order one item, and then prepare any sides at home (usually just microwaving a bag of veg). That way I get my craving item and don't blow my whole day by adding fries or soda or a ton of fried rice. And I still use my sectioned plates. 

On the nights when I cook I've been more mindful about how much oil I'm using, how much butter, how much sauce or other condiments. I substitute certain things when it won't massively change the flavor/texture of a dish. I stopped cooking massive batch meals and now only cook what I need / maybe a serving or half serving extra. My grocery bill is smaller and there's so much less waste. I go back for seconds if I want, but I do seconds of veg and protein first.

I still drink diet soda, but I start every day now with a big cup of water and I drink water with dinner too (turns out that carbonation doesn't always go great with food - sooooo much less heartburn and belching/regurgitation). I also keep a big Nalgene bottle filled with water and nearby most of the day so if I'm thirsty I don't have to go to the kitchen and I'm less tempted to snack or drink soda. I'm basically down to 2 cans a day.

In the last week I've started veeeeerrry loosely using CICO. I know as I continue to lose weight I will need to begin tracking more closely, but I'm trying to ease into it this time. My focus at the moment is more on ""calorie awareness"". Making sure I'm having an actual serving size of a higher calorie snack. Or keeping an eye on how many oz of meat or potatoes or bread. 

I've also found that properly cutting and chewing my food makes a massive difference in feeling satiated. If I notice I'm scarfing my meal (it's been scary hard to break that habit), I force myself to slow down. I take a bite and then set down my fork until I've swallowed. Then I take another bite. 

And one of the most important things, surprisingly, is journaling. Every night. In a somewhat unusual format. I start by writing about my day, things I struggled with, things I don't understand. And then I create a line break and I respond to myself. Sometimes in questions like ""Why did you feel this way?"" ""How can you find the answer to that?"" and sometimes with comfort like ""You messed up today, but there are going to be days you mess up and that's okay. How can we make tomorrow better?"" and sometimes even praise, ""I'm proud of you."" ""You're doing so good!"" I also tell myself ""I love you."" now and that's so bizarrely powerful. ""I love you and your wellbeing is important."" I go back and forth with myself like a little conversation. The ""other me"" responds like I would respond to a dear friend or loved one. With compassion and care and concern and advice. I've stopped beating myself into the ground with frustration and guilt and shame and I find myself feeling more confident and grounded. I feel like it's giving me better perspective.

**Some NSVs**

* My jeans fit much better and aren't uncomfortable in the waist anymore.

* Bending over to tie my shoes is easier - I feel less like I'm squishing my organs/struggling to breathe.

* I feel fitter in general. My first week walking I was a panting, sweating, mouth-breathing mess. Now I can walk further and at a better pace without being winded. I'm not hunching over on my walks anymore or looking at my shoes in embarrassment.

* I have more energy during the day and I'm sleeping better at night for the first time in aaaages.

* A guy I see every once in a while on my walks called out to me and did a little fist pump thing the other day. I don't know if he can actually see the difference or if he just sees me trying, but it felt really good to be acknowledged.

* I got confident enough to go to REI and ask the guy in the shoe department to help me find a good hiking boot. I was really embarrassed leading up to it because I have some trauma from growing up and getting the kind of ""lol fat girl trying to exercise"" bullying. But I feel ready to start investing in my success. And instead of being weird or gross towards me he actually seemed pretty stoked to help and that felt really validating. 

I'm early on in the journey, and I have a long way to go, but I'm 1/5th of the way to my ""goal"" weight (Shooting for 160-ish but honestly I'll be stoked just to get below 180 again). I know the weight loss will slow as I get smaller. That I will need to adjust my portions again and start paying closer attention to all my calories. But this is the best (and healthiest-feeling) start I've ever had. I am so excited for what the rest of this year will bring.",1644597178.0

I'm a 28M, around 194 lb last I checked and I know I eat rather unhealthy. My big problem is snacking and alcohol. Recently I've stopped munching on potato chips, maybe have 2-3 per day but my big problem is cookies. I find it hard to just eat 1 and I have this craving throughout the day. I also drink 4 beers a week, 2 on Friday and 2 on Saturday.

I'm deathly allergic to all nuts and lentils so unfortunately I have to cut those out. I've tried to find a diet that works but there are so many different kinds I'm really not sure where to begin.

ETA the whole thing had roughly 6 g net carbs all together (17.9 g carbs/11.9 g fiber)",1644692950.0

Still pushing through to get to my weight loss goal ❤️,5,sqtdsb,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqtdsb/still_pushing_through_to_get_to_my_weight_loss/,0,"I weighed myself at 189kg, what made me to decide to start losing weight was the scale saying “error” because I was scared seeing it get close to 200kg. And also seeing my skin not healthy and being damaged. I hate having a big ass too 😂

I’m a young adult I never got to experience my teen or childhood. Because of my weight, I missed out on a lot.

I weigh myself daily but I think it’s kind of a bad habit the same time because it makes me sad in a way, you know. But I’ve lost more weight that I thought I could never do, being plus size my whole life since 7 now 21. I’ve still got so much more to take off my body. I hope it helps with my body dysmorphia in the future. 

I’ve bought clothing for when I reach my goal limit. Because it helps me push further, I’ve been doing things slowly too especially changing the way you eat makes you drop weight off faster at first. 

I want to fit into a size 15-16 AUS clothing and drop a shoe size too, and to be more comfortable at events anything or sitting down on certain chairs and to be able to go on rides like roller coasters again 😩",1644678086.0
Epiphany In Changing Room!,94,sqagwl,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqagwl/epiphany_in_changing_room/,10,"You know what. I am sad. I am scared. I feel shame. I’m owning it. I’m done with this pussyfooting bs!

Today I went into a Torrid. For anyone who doesn’t know, women’s plus size clothing store. I decided to try some clothing on. I don’t have much that actually fits me. I’ve been trying to gain some kind of wardrobe while I’m on a budget because I haven’t worked for a long time. I got very sick a few years ago and it wound up being an autoimmune disease. Worst time of my entire life. Absolute deepest hell hole I have ever been in. Lost everything. Pretty much became homeless for a time. Praise God, the universe, my doctor, whoever that I was diagnosed and got treated so I am doing a lot better now. I also almost died from covid. Lost a ton of my hair. I have been through some shit. Lots of shit. 

I got to my highest weight while sick. 335 from what I saw when I weighed at one point. Could have been more. Who knows. I am a 5’4 woman and I’m about to be 33. I’ve been having a hard time for the past two years trying to get out of the threes. My body doesn’t hold this weight well. I don’t look great in anything. I’m uncomfortable. My body has been scarred. I am all stretch marks all over and I will have excess skin. Maybe a lot. My skin doesn’t look great. 

While I was trying clothing on, nothing was fitting. 3X as per usual. Nope. 4X. Too tight in areas. I would usually stop there and just take or leave the clothing to fit in eventually. But it’s not possible for me now. I need to get a job and get back to life. I need clothing that looks decent. I had my mom with me and I tried the 5x on. It fit. It was a bit tight around my tummy. I was horrified. I am horrified. But what can I do? This is where I am at. I am 312lbs as of this morning. Do I expect to look thin? Maybe I do. It’s how I wish to look. I don’t accept my obesity because it is unacceptable. Anyways. In the fitting room. I show my mom the 5x while saying it’s a 5x in shock. She meekly disagrees that I should be in a 5x and half ass mumbles out that it’s big on me. I loudly say, “EXCUSE ME??? Where is this BIG on me???” In shock at how blatantly she is lying to spare my feelings. 

A lot of things hit me in this moment. I come from a family that was obsessed with diet culture and still is. I was the sacrificial lamb to it as a child. I was the first born of the millennial generation. I was the scape goat for cheat meals. I was put in weight watchers as a single digit year old from being chubby instead of my parent simply choosing to make my life healthier. I was forced into diet culture. Forced to hate my body the way all the women in my family before me did. Forced to deprive myself in the name of being skinny and attractive instead of healthy and happy. Used to get extra orders of fries one week and then punished for wanting it again the second week. 

I have never liked my body. It’s never been mine. It’s been overweight without my wanting. It’s been a normal weight through starvation. Now it is super morbidly obese. I have binged for years and starved myself for years. I have never treated this body with the respect it deserves because I was never taught how to do that. I was taught to feel shame when it didn’t look the way society said it should look. And instead of acknowledging that and working to make my body the way I wanted it to be, or even just healthy, I was taught to be delusional about it. To not only not feed it properly, but not even cloth it properly. If I didn’t fit in a smaller size, well then I guess I just don’t deserve to wear any other size. I have punished myself by depriving myself of even dressing myself properly if it wasn’t in a size I was comfortable in. 

I want to blame my mom, and I certainly can. But she is also the victim of this mentality. It’s her mother who is The Worst about it. And maybe her mother’s mother was even worse. I’ve always had a strained relationship with my aunt because she is like 100% pure logic and extremely critical. She is the type of person that has to constantly say, “I tell it like it is!” Because everything she says is too harsh and in your face, and mostly inappropriate for her to be telling you about. There’s rarely softness with her. But I see why now. She is the total other end of living in a fantasy where everyone is fooling themselves into thinking they’re going to be whatever and perfect by talking about it and wishing for it and buying sizes for it. She is so harsh. So critical. But I get it. She’s grown up around people talking a lot of nonsensical shit and she only wants the truth. Or her truth, as I like to say. My mom is the opposite end. In a total fantasy realm because she doesn’t like a harsh world. She’ll do anything to shield me from upset. Even say that a piece of clothing on me looks too big when it certainly is not. Neither of these things are helpful at all. They’re only hurtful. I want the middle ground here. 

I said this to my mother. That she doesn’t need to shield me anymore. This is reality and it is what it is. I am not interesting in this delusional bullshit where we make it seem like tomorrow will just be okay because that’s what we need to hear. It will only be okay if we work to make it okay. We can be realistic and honest with each other and ourselves and support everyone’s goals if they’re not hurting us or anyone else, but no more nonsense. No more hoping for happiness. 

So I purchased a lot of clothing today. In 5X. The highest clothing size there pretty much is out there, and the highest I’ve ever been in. I feel so ashamed. The eating disordered parts of me want me to really fall victim to this. I could hide in my bed and let my life turn into more ruin. But my whole life has been a ruin from the delusions of my weight needing to be the center of my universe. It’s all I’ve ever focused on. Literally. I’m not saying that in a sarcastic way. I often think I could probably have solved some kind of serious world crisis or been an astronaut if only I was allowed to focus on being smart and whatever else interests me aside from how skinny I should have been. To be attractive. To be sexy and worthy. I don’t feel any of those things right now. As I type this I almost feel like I’ll never even pleasure myself again. That is how disgusted I feel with myself right now. I don’t even deserve a self prepared orgasm. But whatever. I don’t want to be this weight and this is my weight. I’m a size 5X right now. I want to change this and only I can change it. 

And that’s it. That’s my epiphany. That all I have is what I have and where I currently am. I’m done fantasizing about being thin. Tricking myself into thinking it’s not that bad, or I’ll get there one day. I was supposed to lose at least 16lbs by now and I have not and I’m very unhappy about it, but I also didn’t stop myself from going over my calories the past four weeks. Delusional. Eating disordered thinking right here. For me, it is bad. I am unhappy. I am uncomfortable and unhealthy. So I have to change this. I have to be better. And I’m going to hold my own hand as I just put my foot down and put my calorie limit to a point where I should lose 2lbs per week. And I will have faith that I will stay in my calorie range. And have faith that I will make it out of this so I can truly be at peace with myself. It is okay for me to be unhappy in this body. I may always be. But I will respect it and my emotions around it from now on. No more punishing myself. Just self love. Loving myself enough to be who I want to be, in all aspects of life. Listening to myself. That’s what I want to do. More listening to myself. 

Anyways. I’m sorry this is so long and is really just a vent. Have a good weekend, all💜",1644615908.0
"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 12, 2022",9,sqp3ye,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqp3ye/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_12_2022/,0,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

You all are such an inspiration! Now it’s my turn to join in!,4,sqswrv,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqswrv/you_all_are_such_an_inspiration_now_its_my_turn/,0,"I joined this sub some while ago, but I felt I was not really a part of the community, since I did nothing to lose my weight. I’ve been reading the posts and I got motivated to set some goals and work towards them.

My story - In my childhood I was an active kid, spent a lot of time outdoors with my friends and working in my parent’s garden. Looking back I had no real issues with weight, but entering my teens I started thinking my thighs were too big (they were not), so I did a bit of running and tried to cut down on sweets.
The real issues with weight began in my last year of high school. I had left my parents’ house when I was 15, now lived in the capital city with my depressed grandma, developed a depression myself and somehow discovered that food can offer comfort. I gained 10 kg quickly and lost 15 kg during half a year. Something magical happened when I was at my low weight. I became a knock-out. Guys went crazy about me, I got scouted by photographers and model agencies, and for the first time in my life I felt attractive. This is where I got convinced that if I’m thin, I’m liked and valued.
Yet my personality was very fragile. When I faced new challenges, I ate. That was my coping mechanism. Fast forward a few years, I broke up with the love of my life and drowned my sorrow in food, and became obese. Got out of it in a couple of years but ended up with a lot of loose skin. Have been super body conscious since.
Most of my life since then I’ve been in a normal weight, quite sporty, with a couple of exceptions (e.g.pregnancy when I gained 35kg!) and I found my own golden standard- at 1.77m I look and feel my best at the weight of 64 kg, but my usual sustainable weight is 68 kg.

Now I’m 75kg due to stresses of my new job, where again I feel fragile and incompetent, so I eat. This has got to stop. I know now that my value as a person is not determined by my weight, but I also know that I feel a lot better when my cothes fit, I’m being active and my belly doesn’t wobble when I walk.

So I’ve decided to start my journey to my sustainable weight of 68kg, and if that’s possible, later I’ll aim for 64kg, not as a must but as nice to have.

My ammunition- a lot of nice cosmetics for skin, body and hair. It might sound silly, but I need to feel good and take care of myself during the journey, self-hatred doesn’t work for me, pampering helps.
I aim for a diet that I can sustain. For me it would be proteins, a lot of fuit&veg, less junk food (but not never ever, just as a rare treat).
I plan for physical activity each day. I’ll go out running when the snow melts, until then I have yoga and walking. That has never really helped me to lose much weight, but it is a huge help for my mental wellbeing + I love to feel strong and be active. (For the starters I did 2h of snowboarding yesterday and 40min of ashtanga yoga today. Feels good :) )
I quit the job that made me highly anxious.

I hope to lose 7kg in 3 months. I took a before picture which I will post if I succeed. Please keep your fingers crossed for me!",1644676685.0

My postpartum weight loss observations,1,sr0t0t,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sr0t0t/my_postpartum_weight_loss_observations/,2,"Background:

My (33F, 5’5”) adult weight has always fluctuated between 160-165 lbs depending on the season and my activity level. 

I lost about 15 lbs over the course of 6 months before my wedding in 2018 doing weight watchers. Over the next year or so, I slowly gained it back, and after an ectopic pregnancy in early 2019 and the pandemic I was feeling depressed and sitting at about 170 lbs. 

Fast forward to 2020 and I’m pregnant again. Throughout my pregnancy, I didn’t weight myself at home, and just let my doctor keep track so I don’t know my highest weight, but I think I gained about 20 lbs.

Observations between my two weight loss experiences:

- (Negative) I’m 9 months postpartum, on noom, and I noticed that as I lose weight it feels less rewarding than when I lost weight in 2018 for my wedding. For the wedding, seeing the scale go down was almost euphoric because it was the lowest I had been in my adult life. This time as I lose weight, and see the scale go down, I still can’t fit in my pre-pregnancy clothes. It's not as immediately gratifying. 

- (Positive) however this time, my weight loss doesn't have an end date (like my wedding) so even though the first weight loss attempt was slow, I’m more committed to sustainable changes. 

Curious if anyone else has similar experiences or observations.",1644698748.0
At what weight do you personally notice a big difference in how you look?,8,sqoaft,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqoaft/at_what_weight_do_you_personally_notice_a_big/,6,"About a year ago now I started trying to lose weight and have since lost about 25lb! I started in the 165lb area and am now around the 140lb area. I remember when I was still closer to the beginning and was around 155lb and was sad because I didn't notice much difference. My mum was explaining to me how I would probably notice once got around 150lb as for her that is the weight that she notices a huge difference, however she is 1/2 an inch taller than me so maybe that makes a big difference in our experiences.

I personally don't really recall noticing a huge difference at 150lb, but now that I'm here in the 140lb area I have noticed something. The past months I have fluctuated from 138-142lb, and this range has a HUGE difference in how I look for me. Once I drop past 140lb I notice a huge difference, and especially at 138lb. I look so much smaller, and as soon as I rise up to 141/142lb I notice I look much bigger. Crazy what only 5lb can do once you are a lower weight, when in a higher weight a whole 10lb made not much difference.",1644660308.0
Found an old photo and compared it to myself now and I didn't realise the difference,239,sq09cw,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq09cw/found_an_old_photo_and_compared_it_to_myself_now/,18,"I was looking through an old phone I had a few years ago and just looking back at old photos and whatnot but then I came across a photo I'd taken when I must have been trying to lose weight at that time, and since I take photos of my body pretty regularly now due to major insecurities about my weight, I thought it would be interesting to see the difference, and I'm actually pleasantly surprised at the difference I saw. I'm usually the last person to notice my own weight loss but I must say that there is a bit of a difference which I'm happy about!

I should add that I'm still nowhere near where I want to be in terms of weight and there's still a lot of work needed to be done.

Success post I am officially no longer overweight!,164,sq1pn6,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq1pn6/success_post_i_am_officially_no_longer_overweight/,21,"Hi everyone.  I've been lurking here for about two years watching all these success stories and I promised once I finally got to normal BMI I'd make a post too.  

I started in March of 2021 at about 275 lbs and this morning weigh in at 188.8 lbs putting me at normal bmi for my height.  

My routine was a typical calorie deficit of 800 for the first 6 months then I increased intake to a 500 deficit and started doing workouts.  My weightloss slowed down but its helped me gain muscle and it feels a lot more sustainable.  

I've really lived hearing so many people's successes and struggles and wanted to show my own as well.  This wasn't easy but I feel so much better and more capable now.  I live out in the mountains and finally feel like I can take advantage of all the amazing things this state can offer.

Feel free to ask me any questions about my routine or struggles I faced and thank you all for being a resource for me as I went through this.

**disclaimer**: I'm not a professional in this area. I'm not saying my advice is absolutely right and you should definitely do it. it's just a thing that worked for me and many people.

  
**storytime**

I've tried calorie counting. I've been left and right on the disordered eating spectrum. I've restricted unhealthily and binged unhealthily.

when I was too young to even think about dieting, I discovered calorie counting. my eating was really restrictive; around 800 kcal a day, kind of low in carbohydrates -- while training volleyball 7h a week and running a few times a week, while also doing home workouts. on the weekends I would allow myself to eat whatever I wanted, and I'm pretty sure my relationship with food and exercise wasn't half as bad as it would get later. 

anyways, I thought that was healthy and sustainable. and I was for a while until I started overeating more and more whenever I allowed myself to eat.

then I discovered keto/low carb, which was a blessing and a curse. I learned so much about nutrition and biochemistry, but my restrictive mindset always took over, and I would restrict calories and carbohydrates. I remember eating only low-carb vegetables for a while, which led me to my first middle-of-the-night binge (and many more). even when I allowed myself to eat fats and proteins, my calories were so low and I felt really deprived -- I was around 16 and was not enjoying life because of my obsession with food. also, I felt depressed for the first time in my life, and, at that time, the weight that I gained and was not able to lose was the main reason -- my self-esteem was lower than ever.

and the whole binge-restrict cycle went on for years. and it was hell.

then I read that famous intuitive eating book, which showed me a new perspective on eating. however, I was still so disconnected from my body and in such a bad place mentally that it did not work. I still keep all I learned in my, though.  


**what I've learned**

fast forward to me, in a good place in terms of mental health for the first time in about 5 years.

I love the idea of intuitive eating. but still use my knowledge about nutrition, biochemistry, evolution, and history.  here is **my** current perspective on things.  


* I **have two ideal targets. I say ideally because the goal is to get as close to it as possible, and if I don't that's okay. (SOMETHING IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN NOTHING!)** I loosely track my protein intake -- 1g per lb of bodyweight -- and try to eat vegetables (especially the green ones) with every meal. sometimes I drink an ""Athletic Greens"" kind of juice. That's it.

&#x200B;

* I **have physique goals. but I still enjoy life.** I make mindful eating choices, meaning I'm aware of what it is that I'm putting into my body and why. am I hungry? that's okay. am I just really craving something sweet because I'm on my period? that is also okay. do not mean I have to forget my goals. I did not ""ruin"" anything.

&#x200B;

* **a huge portion of the foods we have available nowadays are engineered to be delicious, yet not nutritious and probably addictive**. **however**, I allow myself to eat things that are not necessarily nutritious or beneficial physically because **I like food and that's not gonna change**. **I still keep my goals in mind,** and I don't give in to any craving. **but I honor my psychological well-being** and prioritize whatever needs to be prioritized at the said moment.

&#x200B;

* I **don't punish my body with exercise, but I value its importance.** I recognize the importance of having muscle mass and good cardiovascular health and endurance. **I learned how to differentiate tiredness from laziness**. I still have discipline, but **I learned to be compassionate when I'm tired or in a bad place mentally.**

  
I think that's it. I'm willing to talk about this in the comments and privately.",1644687910.0

79 pounds down!!! and other good things :),70,sq5is0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq5is0/79_pounds_down_and_other_good_things/,6,"Today marks my lowest adult weight! I weighed in this morning at 218! I started my weight loss journey on Dec. 29, 2019, and I have lost just about 80 pounds. I have 43 pounds left to lose to reach my goal weight!!

Big changes:

\- no more knee or ankle pain, or any pain for that matter - I really struggled with my left knee and it hurts when I overdo it with exercising but for the most part, pain-free!

\- I am now a size XL from a 3-4XL (!!!!)

\- my sleep is so much better! I get a solid 8 hours and I don't snore anymore!!

\- I feel much lighter and my form in the gym has improved significantly, so much so that I've had members come up to me and compliment how good my form is :):):)

\- I love to exercise, like LOVE exercise!!! I wake up at 5A and I am at the gym by 6. My coach says that I train like an athlete! My workouts are my favorite part of my day and I am active throughout the day. I am averaging 12K steps and about 2 hours of activity daily :) I set a goal back in April to work out consistently for one year and I can proudly say I stuck to that goal, this April marks 1 year of working out 4-5 times a week.

\- my relationship with food is completely transformed - I haven't binged in 2 years! I see food as something that my body needs, no more no less. Exercise is how I cope now, not food. When I've had a shitty day I turn on my favorite music and I dance it out! I used to sit and eat until I felt sick. 

\- CICO works and I am proof of that. I have a 240-day streak on MFP!

There are many factors that contributed to my weight loss but the biggest is the fact that I have a support system now. I reconnected with my childhood friends in 2021 and they have become my family since I am estranged from my biological family. In 2021 we spent time together and we had so much fun strengthing our bond. 2021 was the best year of my life and my weight loss is a reflection of that. Not only do I look good, I FEEL good.

Helpful Flowchart if you Didn't Loose Weight This Week,52,sq3zng,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq3zng/helpful_flowchart_if_you_didnt_loose_weight_this/,14,"Hey hey everyone!!

I wanted to share with everyone on this sub a helpful flow chart tool I use with my clients when they step on the scale and become frustrated with the scale not moving that week.

Weight loss on the scale is affected by a **MULTITUDE** of things. 

* Sleep
* Stress 
* What you ate
* When you ate
* If you're regular 
* Your body's hormones
* When you weighed yourself
* How you weighted yourself (clothes on or off?)

All of it. 

So when we step on the scale and see the same ((or worse, a bigger number!)) it's easy to get discouraged and think it's because of something out of our control that we did and beat ourselves up.

But calling yourself names and vowing to never eat pizza again is not the answer.

Instead? I suggest to take a moment away from the emotional response and figure out logically what happened. When we can identify a problem it can be improved. Knowledge is power. I have this easy [to follow pdf flow chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ES8CjfWb8F-mLzSe4MYDx-GPc5eQrMX/view) that helps to take the emotion out of the cause and uses logic to address what needs fixing.

What are some other things people have experienced that has caused an unwelcome number on the scale? And how have you dealt with it?

Another example: last night I had two egg burritos, all less than 600 calories. Keep in mind I can put away large pizzas and wings.

Just to give you a mental image of the guys im talking about, i will use celebs as a benchmark so to speak.

Tomorrow is my friends birthday party. I live with her so it’s not like I could skip out if I wanted to, but I also don’t want to. Of course there’s going to be lots of alcohol, food, sweets, and pizza. 

Any tips on what I should do or how I should organize my way through it? What’s a good way to calculate the calories?
If I do eat pizza it’s usually cheeseless and meatless. But I also don’t want to be a drag and just start cooking my own meal in the kitchen while everyone is having fun. And I know I’ll be tempted to drink.
Any advice?

Thanks!

Edit 1: Thank you for the advice! What I’ve gathered is to eat earlier in the day and just try not to think too much about calories and enjoy the day. However, I do see too that some people have said to pay attention to mindful eating, that’s very true. I think I may order the cheeseless pizza, if I feel like it, or I may just make my own dinner. But I’m going to try to abstain from alcohol. As for the snacks, I might indulge a bit here and there but keep my portions low. Crossing fingers!",1644627425.0

Motivation for weight loss: I have psoriatic arthritis and have had it for 16years (diagnosed) but my knees, ankles and hips are feeling the extra weight now. Movement helps reduce pain but the extra weight makes it difficult so my rheumatologist has recommended weight loss and increasing movement to prevent damage. Also noticed my cardiovascular health is awful and I get out of breath easily.

I’ve officially lost 15 pounds!,589,spg8wy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spg8wy/ive_officially_lost_15_pounds/,20,"I’m back at my high school weight after gaining 15 pounds my Freshman and Sophomore years of college—the Freshman 15 is no joke! Through healthy eating (not skipping meals and not over-eating) and exercise, I’ve achieved my first weight-loss goal in roughly 3 months (since November).

I went from 163 pounds to now 148. As a 5’7” female, my current goal is to get down to 135-140, so I still have a long way to go, but I’m very proud of myself—and my two best friends for taking this journey with me.

Before: [WARNING! Talking about an ED.]
In the past couple years, I binge ate—starving myself in the morning and eating fast food and sugary sodas consistently. I didn’t like the way my body looked or how I felt afterwards, but I still ate. It was almost shame eating—I would eat an entire box of mac & cheese with a half stick of butter and drink large Baja Blasts from Taco Bell, and I felt like crap afterwards… I didn’t exercise and I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without my pulse elevating and a shaky breath (I’m still not very good at it haha). Overall, I didn’t feel like myself. I just felt bad, and while I would never judge other people on their weight or their bodies, I was very hard on myself. So I decided that I needed a life change.

What I did:
My journey started out with a scale. I wanted to know how much weight I gained after Thanksgiving because I knew my previous weight was around 160. I saw my weight and told myself that I would continue to track it everyday in the morning before I ate anything.
My second change was my diet. Instead of eating fast food and out all the time, I decided to start cooking home meals. This included pasta, lettuce wraps, salads, lots of fruits and vegetables. I also used portion controlling, where I would follow what the nutrition label recommended (especially with things like chips and cereal. As a pescatarian, I also added a lot of healthy and lean proteins to my diet—fish, eggs, beans. This also boosted my energy because I wasn’t overeating and I was getting enough protein. Also, I switched all of my soda and 300 calorie coffees to green tea and straight coffee.
Finally, I started an exercise program. Instead of taking the bus to class, I walk on campus (it’s very big and VERY hilly). I got to the gym for 1.5-2 hours and walk and run on the treadmill for at least 45 minutes. I do an workouts 3 times a week, yoga at least 5 times a week, arm and leg workouts 3 times a week and this tends to burn around 300-400 calories—which definitely makes eating an unhealthy snack feel awesome. I always make sure to have a protein bar or shake after the gym to keep myself energized and happy.
I think the most important tip I have though is eat what you want, but make sure you eat enough to make you full so that you don’t overeat later to compensate. Undereating isn’t healthy and neither is overeating—I know this from experience. Make sure you eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re full—this is the basis of portion control and it really does work! Also, try not to be hard on yourself even if the scale does go up one day—you will lose the weight.",1644524967.0

In a single year, I had lost 65lbs and then I'd met my husband, we started dating and instead of going to the gym, I would go to his house after work. The weightloss stopped, but surprisingly I had altered my lifestyle enough that I didn't put weight back on, instead I just fluctuated between 205-215 for several years.

I decided I was ready to jump back into it early 2020. I started exercising again, monitoring what I eat, all that good jazz that worked. Yet my weight was stuck at 215 and would not budge. I started feeling just sick all the time and stopped eating completely. Weight still would not budge. If you're thinking, ""pregnant?"" You would be 100% correct and a hard one at that.

I’ve still got a ways to go, twenty-five pounds to my first goal and (if I decide to keep going) another fifty after that to reach what would be considered a healthy weight… but I’m over eighty pounds down, and am pretty happy with my progress so far!

Unfortunately, I’ve struggled to find that perfect balance, and lose weight at a moderate speed. If I take it easy, I’ll sometimes see no movement at all in the scales for extended periods, followed by sudden unexpected drops. If I push even a little bit though, I lose weight way too fast… like, I still maintain my 1500 daily calorie minimum (for reference, my currently budget is about 1700), but eat closer to that line, and go a bit harder working out. The last five days, I decided to try to push it so that I would be at eighty pounds lost in time for the six month mark, but dropped 4.8 pounds, which has now maintained for two days.

I have no idea why my body’s on such a hair trigger, but gallstones don’t sound fun, so I’m doing my best not to lose weight too quickly.

For eg if I ate 1400 calories but I did spinning for 30 mins and burned 200 calories, would that mean overall I have had 1200 calories or wud it still mean I have gone over my limit at 1400?

I had tried ""starting again"" after Christmas, and a few different times in January and it's just been hard to get into the type of mindset I was in for so much of 2021.

I'm on a similar mission. I'm down to 80kg in 2 months. The weight is close to my 76kg best weight but I've still got alot of fat to lose it seems to go to the stomach and especially thighs and legs in general.

My arms seem to pack muscle on very fast. I have gone from not much muscle to a decent amount and my arm strength is nearing my best ever already.

I gym 6 or 7 days a week. (I've only just had my 6th day off in total since I started 2 months ago)

Unfortunately I have no friends, no partner and its always been this way. So that does beat me down. But I use the gym to escape & am up at 4 45am daily to gym.

I hope we can all achieve our goals together.

"The stupidest ""problem"" to have.",1,sqfhyk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sqfhyk/the_stupidest_problem_to_have/,6,"I am currently maintaining a caloric budget of between 1200 and 1350 a day. I use Noom as guidance but also wilfully go over the very restrictive 1200 because I don't think it's completely necessary, and I wanted to give myself the best chance at meeting my goals.

Well, I'm meeting them. Too well.

I don't have any prejudices against food. I cut back on certain kinds, mainly refined carbs and sugar. I drink my 8 cups of way a day (most of the time). I indulge in treats when I feel like them. I basically slimmed down my whole pantry, with diet versions of everything that I didn't want to lose, and plenty of veg and protein. But here is my problem, which I am aware could feel like a privilege:

I am not hungry anymore. Ever.

Usually, by the time I am done with dinner, I have close to 400 calories in the bank. I really do not want to come under 1200, so I usually make myself eat something high calorie, cheese or buttery popcorn or some chocolate, but I never really crave it and I don't like the way I feel eating it. My meals have been pretty lean - my lunch is always light because I never feel like something heavier, and my dinners tend to come in between 400 and 500 calories. I have never been a snacker and when I'm not hungry, I don't feel like snacking.

I'm not really getting pleasure out of eating the way I used to. I also skip breakfast a lot because I tend to wake up late, but that may help me, so I will be trying to wake up early enough to at least have a smoothie. I will also probably cook with more butter and oil (carefully).

On the plus side, I seem to be dropping 0.1-0.2 kg a day, which is great, lol.

But just wondering: does anyone else have this experience? How do you counter it and make sure you're getting your calories? Any other impressions? I have never felt this way before, and I really thought I'd have a hard time meeting my calorie budget, but nope. The struggle is actually meeting the minimum.",1644629750.0

I am trying to follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_L9qAHVJ8) exercise video and try to get a little further in every time I exercise. I got to 20 minutes once, with a break. And 11 minutes without one. When I went for 20 minutes I got one of the worst headaches I have had in a long time, and just generally felt awful. It was a bit scary so I haven't pushed myself like that again.   
I wasn't dehydrated, I made sure to drink plenty in between exercises.... So that wasn't the issue.

But yeah aside from that, I intended on exercising every other day. But I noticed that usually the other day, my muscles are still quit tired and I can't go for more than 5 minutes before needing to stop. Should I keep trying to exercise with this video every other day? Or take a two day pause in between?  
And how far do I push myself? Is taking breaks ok if I last longer that way?  
I don't know much about exercising, so any advice is appreciated.

Information that might help, I am morbidly obese (390 pounds/5'8/172cm). I was extremely sedentary for three years, didn't take more than a hundred steps some days.

I’ve been working on weight loss for a while. Initially I had a labor intensive stocking job but had to quit because I moved. Since my new job is way way less active I decided to start going to the gym.

Tonight was my first night going and it was super nerve wracking but I did it! I’m very proud of myself. However I’m feeling a little overwhelmed on where to begin, how long to work out for, what muscle groups to work on, how many reps. That kinda thing. I went for an hour tonight when felt like a good start. Just doing random machines and briskly walking on a high inclined treadmill. 

I’m wanting to focus on gaining muscle and weight lifting as I have PCOS and that’s supposed to be great for IR. Also  not stressing my body out too much and causing me to hold onto weight as I guess can happen with PCOS and HIIT type stuff.

I've been cutting for roughly 3 months. 5'7 177 lbs eating roughly 1600 calories per day, 110-120 grams of protein. I would say I go over my calories by 100-200 calories maybe once or twice a month, with maybe one splurge day during the entire 3 month cut. During the entire 3 month cut, i've jumped around between 175 and 180, not making any significant progress. Currently exactly 177.

I'm really struggling to lose weight. I'm in the gym 4 times a week doing an upper/lower split, and my numbers are slowly increasing (although still somewhat low. 195 bench / 230 squat / 295 DL)

I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, but I'm really trying to cut like 30 pounds before I think about bulking. I was a pretty fat kid, then turned into a skeleton, so now as an adult I'm terrified of becoming overweight again (moreso than already)

Motivation,6,spza5b,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spza5b/motivation/,20,"Hi all,

I've been reading on this sub for a while and felt it was time for my first post. I've seen some great stories and incredible transformations. This community has a strong philosophy and great supporting members.

My question is mainly about motivation. I've (34M 5'10) been slowly gaining weight since college and went from 143 lbs to 194 lbs. On good days I like to pretend that it's all lean muscle mass, but who am I kidding. I've tried many times to turn things around. I have an active fitness subscription and occasionally I will go for a run. The problem lies in consistency. For me, working out is a chore. I will admit that I feel better after I've done it, and the run in itself is exhilarating at times, but it's still a chore. After working a full day and taking care of my kids, I'm mostly just not feeling up to it.

There will be periods in time where I will find motivation and go for a run or GYM (weights) 3-4x a week for 3 or 4 months on end. Then it will come to a full stop for months, until I finally find the motivation to pick it back up again. It's a never-ending circle of finding and losing motivation.

The other thing is, I use eating as a means to control my mental state/happiness. I gain absolutely no joy from eating healthy, never have. I am enormously reliant on that dopamine rush of sugary beverages and high caloric food at the end of the day in order to be happy. I must admit that, being 34 and father of 2, I am also facing some mid-life crisis signals and use food and other dopamine rushes to cope (binge watching series/gaming).

The way things are going currently, I will steadily continue to gain weight, lose a bit of it once in a while, but gain it all back in times with lower motivation.

Hence my question. How can I find motivation, as you have found? How do I break the circle? How do I cope with the feeling of malcontent/irritation/poor mental state without sugary beverages/junk food/sedentary lifestyle choices?

At one point in time, in the beginning of 2019, I got startled by the scales and dropped my drinking (soda)/junk food habits and was able to lose 31 pounds in 4 months. However, I must admit I felt miserable the entire time and struggled with low dopamine levels. How can I do it properly without feeling miserable?",1644585602.0

I finally reached my goal weight,227,sp9o77,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sp9o77/i_finally_reached_my_goal_weight/,15,"I can’t believe it. I finally hit my goal weight!! End of 2019, I fell into a depression- my boyfriend and I were long distance and I hated it, my best friend of 15 years and I weren’t talking, I hated my job, and where I was living. It was my rockbottom, and I unfortunately
turned to drinking. I look back on old photos from that time and I can’t believe how miserable I was. I (25 F) am 5’8 and was at 191 lbs. I hate it, but Christmas 2019 my mom sat me down and told me I was gaining too much weight and how she was worried about me. It really sucked to hear, but I do believe that’s what started to get me going.  

Right before the pandemic, January 2020, I moved to the city I’ve been dreaming of living in since I was 19 with my boyfriend. I was so happy, it felt like a life-long goal I could finally check off my list. However, I was dissatisfied with my body. I used the pandemic to try and better my lifestyle. I met with a local trainer virtually 3x a week and we eventually did in-person sessions once bans were lifted several months later. I was training with her for about 10 months, but it was getting too expensive. While I don’t see her anymore, she taught me how to have a healthy relationship with food and that had stuck with me since. I’ve been on crash diets  since I was 12, so I’ve always been trying to lose weight fast, even when I wasn’t overweight. After I stopped seeing my trainer, I discovered a deep and passionate love for yoga. It’s like crack for me. I’m obsessed with what it does to my mental state and how accomplished I feel when I can finally do a pose I’ve been working on. 

This morning, I stepped on the scale to see I had FINALLY reached my goal weight- 140lbs. I literally bursted into tears. I’ve never been able to set a weight goal and actually hit it. I haven’t been this weight since highschool!! I’m so unbelievably proud of myself, and I feel so cringe for saying that, but I really am. It took a little under 2 years, but I’m down 51 pounds!  My relationships with my boyfriend, best friend (we made up), and family have been so much stronger too. Can’t wait to see what the rest of 2022 brings 😊",1644508281.0

"★OFFICIAL DAILY★ Day 1? Start here! February 11, 2022",6,spwudh,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spwudh/official_daily_day_1_start_here_february_11_2022/,2,"# Is today is your Day 1?

​**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

​So you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you’re overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.

Feeling like a failure,1,sq79fq,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq79fq/feeling_like_a_failure/,4,"I used to go consistently to the gym and loved it. A mix of moderate-weight strength training and some cardio (Couch25k). I also went through a phase of eating an impeccably clean diet, meal prep, etc. Since I started working from home full-time running my own business, and I've moved into my own house in a new city, these habits are not what they once were. 

I calculate my TDEE is now only about 1250 cals a day, if that. I've started to put weight on and it is getting me down. I'm still within a healthy weight range but I'm not confident in how I look. Being 5ft 1 ... the difference between 110lb and 120lb can look pretty big, at least to me, especially as it heads right to my belly and thighs.

I haven't seen the inside of my gym in 6 months. As I've moved the only gym within a reasonable distance is now different. It's actually an insanely good gym and me a few years ago would have loved it ... but I like a quieter pace of life now and I find the blaring dance music, bright lights and clanking of iron quite overwhelming. 

I have started working out at home or going for jogs instead. I bought a mat, some bands, some 5kg and fractional plates and some kettlebells. I've turned my laundry room - which gets used one day a week being a single person - into a makeshift home gym. But every time I see someone who looks like I used to, I think they must be going to the gym and lifting heavy. I'm feeling like such a failure that I don't get there anymore now that I don't have a commute, and it's really getting me down alongside not seeing changes in my body like I used to.

Recently, I've gotten my diet away from take out and carb overload to actually cooking every day ... mostly curries, wraps, omlettes, shakshuka etc. Not exactly a perfect diet but for me, after the past couple of years, to even cook is an achievement. I've been tracking on MyFitnessPal and my macros and calories are decent enough. I'm just still feeling like I should be back on salmon, chicken and veggies only if I ever want to get back down to 110lb again.

And then, I beat myself up about how I'm not doing enough, and binge on dessert foods or nachos (yes, I'm in therapy).

It’s only 10lbs. I feel like such an idiot for being able to just get my shit together and lose it.",1644607213.0

"Frustrated with lack of progress [33M, SW 216lb, GW 185, CW 202.5]",2,sq1r2u,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq1r2u/frustrated_with_lack_of_progress_33m_sw_216lb_gw/,8,"Since early December I’ve been tracking calories consistently and honestly.  As of Jan 1 I’ve also stopped drinking alcohol.  I’ve been weighing myself every morning following the exact same procedure for consistency.  I realize I was only trying to lose 30 pounds to begin with, but I’ve had an “overweight” BMI my whole adult life and would really like to drop into the “normal” category which for me is 185lbs.

I’ve been using LoseIt! to track everything with a stated goal of 1.5lbs lost per week. For me that’s about 2100 calories a day. I rarely eat more than that and if so it’s like 200 more max. While my weekday breakfast and lunches are always the same, I don’t restrict what I eat but rather control the portions.

I walk briskly for about 45 minutes a day as well, though not much exercise beyond that. Though I did lift weights yesterday for the first time in months. 

The first 5 lbs were easy, the next 5lb a little harder. Now for the past two weeks I have been bouncing between 202-204lbs every day.  Getting discouraged because last Friday’s weigh in was 202.2 and today is 202.6. 

I would desperately like to make it to Onederland. I realize I probably just need to keep at it and maybe this has just been a bit of noise on an otherwise successful journey.  But the motivation and enthusiasm that came with my initial progress is gone and I’m afraid it makes me feel hopeless and like it doesn’t matter and I should just go back to eating whatever I want.

Can anyone share some tips, even mental or psychological ones to help me break through?",1644592616.0
Pickles' magic,4,spwt2p,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spwt2p/pickles_magic/,5,"Found a few posts in this sub about pickels and know some of you are fans. Today I just wanted to report my personal experience with brined pickles.

I know they can be an acquired taste, and over the years I've never been a big fan: I tolerated them at most. I even removed then from burgers.

But lately something clicked and I bought a jar and started liking them. 

I used to binge a lot over the years: going to the convenience store to buy chocolate and tiramisu late at night.

Since I've introduced pickles I feel that they removed my sweets cravings. Thinking of eating chocolate after eating pickles feels weird.

Morbidly obese parent,1,sq618x,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq618x/morbidly_obese_parent/,7,"First of all I am sorry for my bad english I hope you will understand my text.

I've never told anyone this in my life because I was (and still I am) too ashamed of talking about my feelings, fears and because being obese/fat is considered a failure or only lack selfcontrol by other people. I think „normal“ people can't understand this. Well, my mother is morbidly obese almost my whole life (I am 31 years old). She tried lose weight and she also had bariatric surgery. But she lost her job about twenty years ago (wow, it's a long time) and she has been at home since this event. She does not go out, she sits in front of the TV, reads books and eats. She has problem with her knees and possibly some other problems, so she can't walk much. I think she gave up her life, she gave up the chance to change her lifestyle. She is very passive.

And it hurts me so much. I am visiting my parents this weekend and I am mentally exhausted being here (and it's just Friday). I know that the only person who can change her life is my mother. I can't do nothing. Of course I tried to help her, advise her, motivate her, talked to her but there is nothing I can do. I gave up too. I gave up normal life with my mother (it sounds terrible, I know) - like walking with her outside in the park, drinking coffee outside, visiting cinema, anything that normal family do. I can't do more. I have some problems with myself, my weight, mental issues and with relationships with other people. I don't have the strength to deal with her health condition. My father never talked about her, about his feelings, nothing. 

Does anybody know how to cope with the fact that my mother is slowly dying? How to cope with this situation? I find out that I tend to close myself to this and I am trying to pretend it doesn's exist. It's like separating my emotions and my mind. But when I visit my parents, all my bad feelings and emotions are back and I am anxious. It hurts so much.",1644603930.0

I also have been trying to eat around 1,500 calories, but I’m worried I may be eating to little. I tried using those caloric deficits calculator and it comes back around 1650-1800 a day. But with the fact that I go out and drink at least 2 times a week I feel like closer to 1500 is better…

Peloton changed my life,129,sp9019,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sp9019/peloton_changed_my_life/,73,"F49/sw: 220/cw:199/gw:135
My husband gave me a Peloton bike for Christmas and I can't tell you how much it has changed my life. We live in a rural area without easy access to a gym, but also to be honest, I would never have been comfortable enough to step foot in a gym. Instead I spent 2 weeks fixing up a spot in my basement, bought some very basic items like a large floor mat, a set of free weights, yoga blocks, a TV stand on wheels for an extra TV we had to cast classes to, some new-with-tags leggings on Poshmark (some were $80 leggings with tags still on that I got for as low as $10 or $15) etc. My personality type is in investing in myself makes me dedicated and on about a $200 budget I have created my own sweet little gym which I just love being in.

This was all brought on by my Peloton bike and the ridiculously fun on demand classes they have. I often set up a 45 minute bike ride followed by a 10 minute cooldown and then add on a 30 minute class like Barre or Pilates or arm toning.  There is everything from shadowboxing to dance cardio to yoga. It's been free for 2 months and I'll definitely be signing up on Feb. 26th once the trial expires. The instructors are great, the music is excellent and the euphoria when you're done is amazing and I find really helps me make better food choices and stimulates cravings for better quality foods.

Sometimes investing in ourselves can inspire a lasting change and it doesn't always have to cost a lot. So many things in life can be put together on shoestring budgets. I was just lucky that Christmas brought the bike into my life as my catalyst, but wanted to pass this along because the while the bike is awesome it isnt completely necessary and maybe I can pass what happened to me along and inspire

Day 9 of CICO... The number on the scale is beginning to trend down!,66,spe18p,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spe18p/day_9_of_cico_the_number_on_the_scale_is/,11,"I know in general not to obsess over every little change as weight will fluctuate significantly due to things other than fat loss, but this is the first time I've actually seen the scale go down in at least 6 years! I'm feeling motivated!

I've never counted calories before and I was eating way more than I ever realized. I gained 70lbs in 6 years. Knowledge is power. Now I'm aiming for about 1400-1700cal/day (2200 sedentary TDEE). I'm mainly eating the same foods, just less, plus making small changes like drinking my coffee black instead of adding creamer, and adding in a lot of vegetables.

Feeling discouraged,2,spz9lk,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spz9lk/feeling_discouraged/,10,"I don’t know. I feel like my body just doesn’t want to lose the weight. Like it’s stuck here for good. I finally have this long term mind set where I WANT it gone, i NEED it gone, and I’m not beating myself up over my appearance for once. Im showing my body love and encouragement and yet, it won’t change!! When I was mean to it, when I told my body it was useless and fat and disgusting, I lost 10 lbs. But now, when I’m finally in a good spot mentally, it won’t do anything!!
But again, I don’t know.
I started mid January with a calorie deficit and took up indoor walking work outs - I’ve drank 64 Oz of water daily, EC stacks to make myself not hungry, I’ve began intermittent fasting in the last 4 days (16:8 sometimes 18:6), and I went from 183 to 179. Just typing that out, seeing that little of progress when I’ve put in so much work and sweat (every god damn morning, I run the babies to daycare and I throw on a workout video and sweat my ass off for half an hour) for that. 4 lbs. 4 measly lbs. i want to cry.

"I am addicted to food delivery, and I have no idea how to stop.",0,sq37y3,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq37y3/i_am_addicted_to_food_delivery_and_i_have_no_idea/,26,"Hey, hi, hello. Longtime lurker, occasional commenter, and first time poster.

I'll spare you all the novel I could write explaining exactly how I got to this point, I'll save that for the autobiography that will likely never exist.

In short, still a read: I got a new job in July of 2020. Took a few months before I was comfortable eating at work, I'd usually run home since I lived so close. Once I was comfortable though I was participating in every store bought lunch we had, usually a couple times a week. Then winter happened, and I don't like driving anywhere I don't have to due to icy road conditions.

Enter DoorDash! Was I ordering lunch every day? Yeah, pretty much. Did I gain 30 lbs? Oh yeah. It became such habit that it continued through the spring and summer, though I did pick-up more than I got it delivered (not that it makes a difference). I tried to get back into routine of going home for lunch, and I struggled. Then I moved at the beginning of Autumn 2021, too far from work to go home for lunch every day. I quit drinking pop at this time, and I haven't had any since.

Deleted, and redownloaded DoorDash every single day for a while. Hit a really, really low point in December that continued into January, paid for a year of DashPass.

It's easy during the day, when there are other people at work, but during these close shifts where I'm left alone in the store for 4-5 hours? I can't leave to get food, I can't do much of anything. I get bored with the hours of downtime, I get hungry, and there I am ordering food for delivery. I started packing a lunch (soup I can microwave, a variety of snacks like some crackers, a few pieces of candy, etc.). We don't have a breakroom or refrigerator. I still end up ordering food in the evenings, I feel like I am going crazy.

My job has become a trigger for me, which has happened in the past at other jobs. The moment I walk in the door my brain switches to food, I can't shake it, and then my anxiety spikes. My only solution was quitting. That isn't an option for me this time. I rarely order delivery when I am home, less than 10 times in the past few years. 

I am embarrassed by the amount of money I spend on food delivery, last year it was easily $5,000 if not more. Money aside, I physically do not feel well.

I am a 25 year old woman, 5'3.5"", and currently 135lbs. I was 150 lbs at the end of September. At my heaviest in 2014 or 2015 I was pushing 200lbs. At my lowest in 2019 I was 113lbs. My ""safe"" weight is 120-130lbs, this is the weight range in which I felt the most physically well. I could maintain this weight without feeling malnourished or deprived.

I am currently not making any serious attempts to lose weight, I do not have a goal weight. I am just trying to build healthier habits, and if I lose a little weight so be it. My biggest issue is food delivery, and I am struggling to come up with a solution.

This is mostly me ranting and venting, as I know ultimately it comes down to my own willpower, but I am open to any and all suggestions from people who have tackled this. Thank you for reading!",1644596567.0
"Had some first take out fast food in half a year, it was a whole new experience compared to before.",28,spia77,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/spia77/had_some_first_take_out_fast_food_in_half_a_year/,1,"I was talking with a coworker about fast foods today and yesterday and finally went to buy some for dinner tonight. It's a pretty expensive thing so I didn't even buy one often before but it's pretty crazy how it felt after a long time.  
  
Back then I used to eat this dish in large size portion because I was really hungry often and today I have eaten small(one size less) and towards the end it was hard to finish. I could've stopped but honestly two munches won't matter compared to money spent.  
  
It was freaking delicious too. I almost forgot the taste. I read a dish such as this goes to about 900 kcal. I asked them to put a bit less sauce so it was more dry but still good. I think I even managed to stay in my deficit cap since I am eating less of a breakfast(for some juice I didn't drink today) and no yogurt after dinner so I had about 900 kcal left for this. It was also the first time I really fully understood the notion of eating slowly to enjoy the food, making small bites, drinking some sugarless pepsi and taking my time made the experience so much better compared to consuming it in revenous hunger.  
  
I doubt I will buy another one soon but it feels great to eat something like that every now and then, in addition to finding out the smaller sized one is big enough to be just beyond my capacity when the big one before had me left craving for more.  
  
Thanks for reading.",1644530361.0
