I can't see anything in the rules that indicate relevant and unfunded surveys are not allowed, so apologies if this isn't permitted! I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Bath and I am studying the health outcomes and experiences of individuals who follow a weight-neutral model of health. In particular, I'm hoping to understand how weight-neutral principles may be integrated into public health. Following a weight-neutral model of health really improved my life so it's a topic I feel very passionately about! If you identify this way, I'd love to hear about your experience! :)

Feeling powerful!,15,g5lr09,FitForFun,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitForFun/comments/g5lr09/feeling_powerful/,4,3 weeks ago I got this burst of energy to start doing home workouts. No idea what came over me as I have been allergic to exercise for months now since beginning the journey to repair my mental relationship with food. For the first time ever this month I felt endorphins. Exercise for me was always a punishment. A means of working off the chocolate bar from the night before. Now I‚Äôm just genuinely enjoying moving and feeling a sweat and burn and I could cry with happiness. I bought dumbbells and a Pilates ball and a mat and have just been blasting music. I work the frontline during this pandemic so it‚Äôs been such a good way to relieve the stress I‚Äôve been feeling! Anywho that‚Äôs my rant! I‚Äôm happy hehe!,1587497032.0

Where does exercise fit in your life?,7,f9zyuy,FitForFun,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitForFun/comments/f9zyuy/where_does_exercise_fit_in_your_life/,8,"Hi All.

I love being active, but wonder how to prioritize in order to get a time effective exercise routine? Any tips?

For context, I was doing yoga 20-30 mins every morning before work, taking a walk on my lunch break for 30 mins everyday, and lifting weights 3 nights a week for 45 mins. Plus some extra yoga and walks on weekends.

I recently realized that this is a lot! Like, too much for me to sustain long term without feeling stressed about work/life/family/romance/fitness balance. I was ""working out"" at least 13 times a week. Although yoga and walking isn't crazy intensity, it may have been overkill only in that it oversaturated my daily schedule.

I also play rugby and the season just started up again. We practice for 2 hours twice a week and have games most Saturdays. Practice gets out late and I'm not sure I will be able to wake up early to do my yoga those days so I was considering keeping my daily lunch break walks, doing yoga M W F before work and letting lifting weights fall to the wayside. It pains me to cut any exercise out, but I want to find a sustainable schedule. I do best with a schedule to remain consistent.  I enjoy the consistency.

How do you prioritize fitness in your life without letting it rule you? What tips have you found in your weight neutral fitness practice that have helped you keep things sustainable and enjoyable while reaping the benefits of movement? I know normal is different for everyone, but what is the normal relationship to exercise that you have established for your life?",1582750092.0

I started personal training for strength last week, and I love feeling how my muscles move and strengthen, how I can stand up straighter.

"""Intuitive Exercising""",25,ewbb4q,FitForFun,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitForFun/comments/ewbb4q/intuitive_exercising/,5,"TLDR:  In doing a step-by-step buildup to what was touted as a beginner routine, listening to my body along the way, allowing my body time to learn and recover, and I feel like I have finally found a sustainable way to exercise.   
I am not a fan of being in pain, and as a toddler mom with a day job, I dont have the luxury to rest and recover. This leads me to quit any workout regimen I start. 

I bookmarked the Nerdfitness beginner's workout ages ago because it seemed like a well-thought out and doable routine, but I was still intimidated by it. The first time I tried doing the whole circuit, I was miserable the day after and quit. The second time, 6 months later, I last 2 days. 

Third Time trying it was 10 days ago. I decided to give myself more grace and take it slow. I wrote down the following list in chalk on my dark colors kitchen cabinet. 

&#x200B;

* ""20 Bodyweight squats.
* 10 Push-ups.
* 10 Walking lunges (each leg).
* 10 Dumbbell rows (use a milk jug or other weight).
* 15 Second Plank.
* 30 Jumping jacks.""

First morning, I did 20 squats in the kitchen while waiting for my son's milk to warm up, and did the walking lunges around the kitchen as he drank it. I went to work, came home, did apartment version of jumping jacks while my son ate his dinner. And I put little ticks on my list.   


Next morning, my legs were jelly. I could barely bend over to tie my shoes without crying out in pain. I hadn't even done the full circuit, and I was already in enough pain that I wanted to quit. My fitness obsessed cousin told me that evening, ""no pain, no gain"", that he was always in a state of soreness, and he relished the pain as a sign of his achievement. What I wanted to gain from exercising was a fitness level which would allow me to enjoy hiking and biking, and I did not want that enough to be in constant pain. 

My husband helped me realize that my goals and my cousin's goals were different, and the cousin was in constant pain/soreness only because he kept ramping up his exercise regimen, and that if I did not ramp up too much, I would soon be comfortable exercising. 

In spite of myself, and in spite of the pain still lingering in my legs, I did 20 squats the next day. Magically, the pain was gone! My cousin gave some complex reason about lactic acid for the magic pain relief, as I did my lunges around the room. 

Yesterday, I finally did  one full circuit, because we were getting takeout and I had the time to spare. My legs are fine, abs are a bit sore today. But I am excited to get back to it tomorrow. I realize that 10 days in, I have not even done the full beginner routine yet, but I am just fine with that. Exercise needs to stay fun and low-pain for me to be able to sustain it, and this ""intuitive exercising"" and listening to my body method is working well for me.",1580414586.0

Small rant about diet culture/working out.,16,es7uty,FitForFun,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitForFun/comments/es7uty/small_rant_about_diet_cultureworking_out/,5,"I was talking to a friend of mine who‚Äôs been doing keto for like 6 months now, and it was a bit of a shock when she said it was the only sustainable thing for her. I respect her body and what she decides is best for her, but the idea of going with little of a necessary food group that‚Äôs integral to your body functioning smoothly is a no go for me.

I was talking about my workout routine and how I want to be strong so I‚Äôm focusing on strength training, and mind you I am a bigger individual, but she was just complaining how I needed to do cardio so I could burn fat so that I don‚Äôt just end up looking bulky. She was also talking about how her sister was doing CrossFit, but she couldn‚Äôt imagine doing it bc in her eyes if that‚Äôs what made her lose the weight, that‚Äôs the only thing that she would be able to do to keep it off.

Like, excuse you, I‚Äôm gonna do strength bc it makes me feel good and I‚Äôve found that cardio bores me too much to commit to it. I‚Äôve gotten really comfortable with the idea of looking buff bc as long as it relieves back and hip pain, I am all for it lol.

And there are so many factors that go into weight loss, both intentional and unintentional. You could do CrossFit for a while then switch over to something else, and yeah your body‚Äôs gonna look different, but that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre using different muscle groups. 

Idk, it just bothered me a bit :/",1579673150.0

Weight-neutral exercise app,7,epbczf,FitForFun,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitForFun/comments/epbczf/weightneutral_exercise_app/,3,"Hey there, I am so glad this sub exists! 

For those who are looking for more ways to move in a way that‚Äôs joyful and not intended as punishment or compensation for eating, I recently discovered (suggested by @yrfatfriend on Instagram) an app called [Joyn](https://www.joyn.co/), which has weight-neutral and accessible yoga, pilates, cardio and dance videos of varying lengths that you can follow along with at home. 

They have some limited free content, and it‚Äôs a $9.99/month subscription to access the rest. I tried out one of the free classes today and am not sure if I enjoyed it enough to spring for a membership, but I‚Äôll try a couple more and thought that others here might like to as well! It‚Äôs refreshing to see a fitness app that isn‚Äôt focused on calorie burning or tracking every step. 

If anyone else has recommendations for fitness apps or YouTube channels that focus on joyful movement, please post them!",1579134975.0
