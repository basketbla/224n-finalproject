"my inability to be alone and love myself is making me insecure, advice?",10,swyi83,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/swyi83/my_inability_to_be_alone_and_love_myself_is/,0,"I wasn‚Äôt like this for the entirety of my life, but recently, i‚Äôve really struggled with being alone. I‚Äôm 18(F) and just recently began my second semester of university in Thailand, which is totally new to me because I grew up in the United States. 
My first semester was completely online, and I stayed with my family in Bangkok, and this affected me a lot. I was constantly by myself for so long, I had no friends, and I think this made me become sick of myself. 

I began my second semester of university partially online, so I moved to my apartment near my university. I made some friends, got to socialize finally, but even though all of that was happening, I still felt so lonely. When I wasn‚Äôt out doing something, I felt like I HAD to get out and be with someone, anyone, but just myself.

As time passed, I became to only get validation from other people, and the asian beauty standards began to make me feel awful about myself. People would say to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so pretty, lose some weight and you would be so much prettier!‚Äù For reference, I was about 5‚Äô5 (165cm), and weighed about 145 lbs (65 Kilos) Since then, i‚Äôve eaten less and lost some weight due to the pressure, which i thought would make me happy, but i‚Äôm still so unhappy with myself.

I downloaded a dating app and met a guy I was really interested in, and spent a lot of time with him, and we ended up dating. The problem is though, whenever he wouldn‚Äôt message me all day, or say he‚Äôd come to see me and end up not doing that, i‚Äôd feel so insecure about our relationship. I relied on him too much to be happy and be company for me, so recently for myself, I talked to him about it and we both mutually agreed to put a break on things while I figure out how to accept myself and feel OK with being alone. 
I want to become more reliant on myself and less about other people. I want to learn to love myself and not wait for other people to love me. I want to enjoy spending time by myself. does anyone have any tips, or any advice that might help?",1645353399.0

The reason clever people have poor mental health: their model of happiness is fed with faulty assumptions,12,swnqfj,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/swnqfj/the_reason_clever_people_have_poor_mental_health/,1,"Why doesn‚Äôt being clever make you happy? Raj Raghunathan, who is a professor in The University of Texas, wrestled with this question in his recent book. The conclusion that he came to was that while smart people are good at achieving, they make misjudgements about how that success will will translate into happiness. He found that a lot of the friends he went to school with were distracted and miserable.

This makes sense when we view the mind as creating models of how the external world works. Like statistical models or meteorological models they can be very complex - but if you feed the wrong assumptions and data into them it doesn‚Äôt matter how complex the methodology is, you‚Äôre going to get the wrong answer out the other side.

So if the intellect goes off the rails when fed poor assumptions, what are the fallacies? Smart people get told from an early age that they need to achieve, need to maximise their potential if they want to be happy. This is not completely wrong - one of the things that contributes to our happiness is doing things we enjoy and work is a big part of that. But this can‚Äôt come at the cost of building human relationships and developing our own sense of being. And it frequently does. When we‚Äôre analysing and working for future happiness we‚Äôre not in the only place we can be happy, which is here and now.

Another fundamental error is to see life as an optimisation problem, that can be solved. Unfortunately its not as analytical as that - happiness comes from living through our senses, letting go of the things we‚Äôre attached to, enjoying the world in front of us and being aware of our thoughts without getting involved. This isn‚Äôt incompatible with being smart but smart people find it difficult to just be, to just sit there and enjoy sitting there. They‚Äôre more likely to be distracted by thought and to be swept away by those thoughts. They‚Äôre more likely to feel like they should be doing something.

So what's the answer? If you‚Äôre one of those gifted kids that turned into an overachieving adult, the one piece of advice I‚Äôd give you is to let go. Easier said than done - but letting go is something that you have to practice to master. You need to identify those things that get your brain agitated (particularly anxieties) and map them, understand them and understand your attachment to them. Overthinking is driven by a faulty assumption that's been fed into the model of the world that exists inside your head. Seeing what you‚Äôre attached to - like a career or reputation, allows you to let go and ease your suffering. 

And of course, practice stopping. Practice being still and watching your mind. You‚Äôll be surprised how quiet it gets when you focus your awareness on it.

My self love journey. Acceptance and Forgiveness.,4,sulu5z,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sulu5z/my_self_love_journey_acceptance_and_forgiveness/,0,"
Tldr: Childhood Trauma gave me lack of self esteem and thought I was genuinely stupid. College years helped me discover the root of my thinking and learned to accept the ways things were. Loved myself and my flaws ever since.

Hello all! I want to share my journey on how I learned to love myself. I was 15 at the time, still growing and trying to make sense of this world. Due to childhood trauma, I always envisioned myself as a pathetic and useless individual. I would question everything that I did was wrong and bad. I would also casually call myself stupid and at times even thought I was genuinely stupid. I had no confidence in the things I did and was reluctant to try new things due to the fear of messing up. I hated the person I was and thought this was the best I had to offer.

Fast forward to my college years. This was when my journey of healing started. I got accepted to a university in a different country. Being away from home was definitely one of the biggest factors in helping me. In college I met so many people with drastically different lifestyles, personalities, attitudes and behaviors. I was breaking out of my comfort zone and for the first time, I was excited to try new things. I wasn‚Äôt afraid of failure. Thinking back now it was ridiculous that I allowed myself to think I was stupid. 

I wanted to get to the root my problem and help understand why I am the way I am. I realized that it was my upbringing. I was always belittled my family members and the word ‚Äústupid‚Äù was tossed at me so often that I was desensitized to it. This eventually led to my behavior and outlook on life when I was in HS. It was hard to believe this at first, because but I thought it was important to accept the fact that this happened in order for me to grow. I realized that it was ok to make mistakes and it is ok to be wrong. 

My journey of self love was about acceptance and forgiving yourself. Self love is not a leap, it takes baby steps. I hope my story will inspire others to not be so hard on yourself and that you can always be a better version of yourself. Never settle for less.

My girlfriend broke up with me last Sunday because she hasn't got the strength to endure my depressive downs. She loves me and I love her... This breakup hit me.

I have been changing a bit since that day, I am trying to be more empathetic, trying to get more fit and also trying to love myself more. See, I'm 22 now and my childhood was... well it sucked! I was abused in school to the point that my colleagues told me they are waiting for me to die because I had suicidal tendencies, my parents mostly ignored my wishes to express myself and I did not have any real friends until I was 15. This is just a short excerpt of what happened to me... needless to say I've grown extremely depressed over the years.

Now after the breakup, I've realised that I have to change, for my now ex-girlfriend that still loves the real and pure me, for my friends that love that love the real me... and of course for me... the REAL me. This real me has been hiding behind walls, that not even the love of this beautiful human being were able to tear down... so the only way is to well do it myself.

I've started to control my eating habits again, so that I don't overeat and gain weight, I've started to work out, well 20mins of Beat Saber a day for the start, but I feel like I'm willing to go further beyond in that area. I have started to look more into self love, for example I am trying to tell me the things that I love about myself, when they appear in my mind.

I am willing to fight myself out of this dark place I have gotten myself into, let that boy that cowers there inside of me express himself in the ways he wants to. This breakup was the wake-up call I needed.

I also have to be 100% honest - I wish I could get her back, she is a truly wonderful person, but I've hurt her... and that is the reason why I must better myself, love myself. I know that there is the big chance, that she will not have feelings for me anymore and yes that is a little downer to think about, but that would also be okay... in the end I am doing this for myself, everyone else I am positively affecting is a big bonus!

So here I am now - willing to post more often about how things are going. And yes I want help, because I will need help... no one fully gets out of depression alone. So if you have any advice that has helped you to love yourself, please share them.
Thank you all!",1645048118.0

Convince yourself of your Worth,27,sthrb7,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sthrb7/convince_yourself_of_your_worth/,2,"Are you happy with who you are?

Something that I have been noticing a lot recently is how a lot of people are not happy with who they are. A lot of people constantly judge themselves so harshly that it kills their confidence in whatever they do. The first step towards any fulfilling relationship is loving yourself- no question about that. When you love and have confidence in yourself, it frees you up to focus on the second and most important step: being at the disposal of the other person. In a relationship, the unconfident person focuses on having their own needs met and usually gets upset if they are not. Pair them up with another unconfident person and you have a recipe for disaster. Put together two people who both feel strongly about who they are as individuals, and you‚Äôve got a rock-solid foundation for a relationship. 

What Confidence is not

Now to be clear, confidence is not being fearless about anything, having the perfect mood all the time, and facing every problem that comes your way head-on. Far from it. The correct word there is perfection. What confidence is, is acknowledging that even when I have those down moments, I will still be proud to be who I am. 

Are you convinced?

Rather than just telling ourselves to be more confident, let‚Äôs take a step back first and think. Are we convinced of our worth? Are we convinced that we have reason and justification to be confident in ourselves? Telling someone to be confident when they do not feel they have any grounds for being confident is like beating a dead horse. This is why I like to focus less on ‚ÄúHow to be confident?‚Äù and more on ‚ÄúWhy should I be confident?‚Äù How to do it does not really matter when you think about it. You can pick up how to be confident naturally once you know why you have every reason to be confident. Now I like to think of aspects that draw confidence or lack thereof as being in one of four categories:

Dislike and Can‚Äôt Change

This category for the most part consists of features about us, usually predetermined at birth, that we do not like about ourselves. Ex: Looks, family financial status, what culture we are born into, etc. Finding confidence in these features requires one to accept that they have no control over them. This allows us to focus more on what we can change about ourselves. What good does thinking about changing something that is beyond us do? On a good day, I am a towering 5‚Ä≤ 7‚Äù. Now yes, it does not feel good to be short, and if there was something that I could do to become taller, (not involving surgery) then I would. But because that is the height that I have been given, I accept it for what it is.

Like and Can‚Äôt Change

When someone is gifted with features that they love to show other people, what exactly are they showing off? They did not work hard to become tall. They did not work hard to have the perfect looks. They did not work hard for their parents‚Äô money, or to be born in a wealthier country. All of it was their own good fortune. I would much rather be admired for something that I worked to earn than something I did not do anything for. Granted, you should still be happy about these gifts. However, it is better to keep it in a more thankful way. One of the biggest things that I am thankful for in my life is to live in the United States. I‚Äôve been to Honduras before and in a few months I will be going to Uganda, and to see people who are born into much more difficult circumstances makes me thank God for the gift of living in America. A gift that I did nothing to deserve, yet was still blessed with.

Dislike and Can Change

There are many things that we dislike about ourselves that we are more than capable of changing. Some people do not like to think about changing these things and would rather accept themselves for who they are. But when someone thinks about it like that, it does not belong in this category. If you like your body the way it is, that is awesome. If you do not like it the way it is, do not pretend that you do and never go to the gym or eat healthily or do anything to improve it. If you are happy with your career, then you are setting yourself up for success, no matter what you do. If you are genuinely unhappy with it, do what you can to transition out of it and do not even think about what others will say. While the solution short term may be to not think about our insecurities. Long term, if we genuinely are less happy because of them, is to do something to change them.

Like and Can Change

This group can be thought of a bit differently than the other three. Things about ourselves that we like but can change are usually things that we‚Äôve built up but can change for worse. The fitness example works well for all four of these so I will use it here as well. If you‚Äôve finally built your dream body but now feel like you‚Äôve earned the right to be more lenient and eat or drink whatever you want, sooner than later you will lose that body. If you‚Äôve built skill in a certain sport or hobby, but then don‚Äôt practice it for the next five years, you will not be near the same skill level as before. Do not take these things for granted. Consistency is key in making sure that you retain these attributes and change them for better, not worse.  

Tied back to Relationships

Confidence is one of the most attractive (and quite necessary) traits of any relationship. As much as I love Disney, what their movies do not show about love is that there are hard times that couples have to go through. There are times when you will have to step up and be the bigger person. There are times when you cannot let insecurities allow you to make rash decisions or break into arguments. Classy confidence in yourself will protect you from jeopardizing your relationship through the tough situations. Build that confidence first instead of trying to find someone to fill that void.

Because in order to grow, you must make hard decisions. And future me will thank present me one day.

Even if it kills you inside to let go those who hurt you, I think it's important to make these tough decisions. You have to keep moving forward and life is about personal development. It's not about giving, giving, giving to others sometimes it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to realise that you do so much for others and you should take a step back and do more for yourself.

TW: Rape 

I am in a bit of a bad phase right now and I figured that this might be the right place to tell my story. 

I had a happy childhood and all except for my father being an absent parent. We never spent much time with him because he had to work. (He chose to work so much.) As a child I always tried my best to get his attention. Like draw pictures or be very good at school. But it never really worked. When I was 14 my parents divorced and for about 3 months my father was giving me and my siblings a lot of attention. But from one day to another it just stopped and we lost contact. 

All this led to me being overly caring and trying to make people proud of me because my father never was. This usually means that in my relationships I am doing a lot. Always putting my Partner first, cooking their favorite meals, trying to comfort them all the time, doing a lot of chores, etc. Honestly I don‚Äôt mind that. I like making other people happy. 
Unfortunately my ex bf of 5 years took advantage of my good will and raped me twice. This also didn‚Äôt really help with my self worth. 

After I finally managed to leave this relationship, I met my current bf who is very supportive and really loves me. I was in therapy for some time and managed to live my life after what was done to me. 
The big problem I have now is that I feel like disappointing everyone all the time. I am trying to be everyone and everything at once for my bf and it is a lot and very exhausting.
 E.g. we share the interest in some sports and we go to the climbing gym every other day. I only started half a year ago and he started 3 years ago. So naturally, he is much better then me which is okay for me. Whenever I fail at a climb that should be in my grade, I feel like he is disappointed that I failed. Especially when he says beforehand that he believes in me, I feel worse. That has nothing to do with him. It‚Äôs just my stupid complex that wants to make someone proud of me.

I try to work on it but I find it extremely difficult to be proud of myself and my accomplishes. Sometimes I just feel like crying but I don‚Äôt want him to see because I feel like disappointing him more for being so weak. 

Thanks for everyone who read this far. 

TL;DR: Because of my father abandoning me I feel  the need to make someone proud of me leading to lack in self worth and constant feeling of disappointing everyone.",1644919750.0

Why you will marry the wrong person,10,sr3w8f,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sr3w8f/why_you_will_marry_the_wrong_person/,0,"Its not unreasonable that we have high expectations from love - we are constantly fed stories through TV and film of couples who perfectly understand each other. We also see ourselves as easy to live with, very reasonable people but of course we view the world around us through a lens. That lens is our beliefs and assumptions; these make us blind to our unkind behaviours that, to be blunt, drive other people up the wall. Our friends and family aren‚Äôt going to tell us - they‚Äôre too nice. You -like me and everyone else - can be irritating sometimes. But we‚Äôre not always aware, so when we‚Äôre annoyed by our partner‚Äôs behaviour of course it feels unbalanced.


Love is a skill, its a training that needs to be learned. A big part of that is having the willingness to see sometimes unpleasant behaviours on the surface - like being grumpy or going on about taking the bins out - as more than they are. More than simply annoyances but revealing something about the mental state of your partner, revealing needs that they have, suffering that you can address.


And thats difficult. Really, really difficult. Because when someone is snippy or short with you our natural reaction is to get defensive, man the barricades and fire back, fight your corner. But this turns a relationship into a war, a series of tit for tat battles where someone is a winner and someone is a loser. It takes effort and discipline to look more deeply, ignore the perceived rudeness and see that they‚Äôre suffering, see that they‚Äôre having a bad day, see that they‚Äôre struggling to cope with work. Could it be that they‚Äôre angry that the bin wasn‚Äôt taken out on time? Of course its possible. But its not reasonable to get angry about the bin not being taken out. The roots of the anger will lie in the past, we need to have the willingness to see that.


Alian de Botton puts it brilliantly inhis TED talk on the subject: he says that love is to apply a generosity of interpretation. This is not just good relationship advice, its a fundamental practice of mindfulness - to see the world as it really is below the surface, building our peace and seeing the suffering of others. Sometimes that can be hardest to do with the person you love the most precisely because they are the person who loves you the most and you feel they‚Äôve hurt you.


Our partners aren‚Äôt saints and neither are we - so part of the deal of being in a relationship is being prepared to cut the other person a bit of slack. Everyone we love is going to disappoint us to an extent at some point and - believe it or not - we will disappoint other people as well. The practice of love is the ability to look past this and see the child within them (and ourselves) that is doing the best they can and wants to be loved.


So in a sense we all marry the wrong person - because we are flawed and they are flawed and that‚Äôs OK. We find it hard to understand why they get annoyed and that's OK. They can‚Äôt always interpret our behaviours and that's OK. What matters is that we practice love by trying each day. Over time that understanding will increase and deepen. 


Of course this is not a rationale for tolerating abuse. If you are physically or emotionally abused please look for help from friends, family, local charities and government. No-one deserves to be mistreated by their partner or anyone else.

so I've been overweight my entire life, always been told you're too fat in unpleasant ways by the people i love most (I dont blame them because they only want what's best for me. although their way of showing concern is super harsh, I understand why because being overweight can have serious issues when I'm older and they all have a backward mindset too). I took these concerns in the wrong way all my life because I was young and not mature enough to understand. spiralled into never looking at myself in the mirror and being satisfied with what I see. hated picking an outfit because ""nothing looked good on me"". always cried saying I don't have good clothes and never wanted to go anywhere. I didn't work out and when I did try to I couldnt do it for more than like 2 weeks. it was never for the right reasons. 

but lately, something changed. I love myself so much. I am so content in being alone. I don't need external love or validation anymore, I already have loads for myself. I am still the same me physically. my body hasn't changed much at all. but whenever I look in the mirror now, I'm always so proud. my sense of style has improved. I walk around confidently with my back straight and chin up just happy to be in the moment. I don't k ow what triggered this but I'm so grateful. I go on walks regularly now, twice on most days. although they're not weight loss exercise per say, at least I move my body around and I fucking love it. my love for food is ever-growing and I love healthy meals just as much as meals that are not so healthy.

My basketball breakdown (large rant),1,sqejys,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sqejys/my_basketball_breakdown_large_rant/,0,"    Yesterday, I had a game where I was playing point guard. (Aka an important role) Which I have done only like 6 times in my life. In the first quarter I fucked up badly. I had so many turn overs. So, obviously my coach benched me. When I was on the bench I had so much self doubt clouding over me. I felt at that moment I was just holding my team back. 
I felt that I was just useless. I felt like this for a while to the team and it all just came out. My eyes started watering and I was dead silent. I did my best to hold my tears the entire game. I succeeded‚Ä¶

   Yet, I ended up crying on the ride home. The worst part was that my dad yelled at me for always crying over the games. The thing is though you‚Äôre aloud to cry. Then he started to bring up how I should just be grateful I am even getting rides to these games. The typical foreigner parent. My mom wasn‚Äôt any better either. She ended up throwing my guitar. The funny thing was that I thought she would hit me. The arguments ended up with the threat I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to my tournaments. That broke me. If I missed a game just because I sucked I would see myself as a quitter. I recall calling my friends about the situation and they kept saying that I was good at basketball. That I shouldn‚Äôt be hard on myself. A large part of me didn‚Äôt believe them. I broke down so many times that night. Yes, I realized many things and can take improvements from failures. But the pain was unbearable. I have had good games so why can‚Äôt I be proud of what I do.

  I always thought I was doing the right thing by working hard. I am aware that it will pay off one day. But, when your best isn‚Äôt good enough. It really can tear you down.So many times I know I could be working harder. It‚Äôs funny how hard working people can perform worse than people who don‚Äôt give much fucks on the game like you do. It‚Äôs likely I have been working hard the wrong way. Working hard changed my life. Yes, in a good way but also the bad way.

  It‚Äôs so weird that I workout three times a day and wake up at 5am (many more things) but still feel like a useless piece of shit. Like what the hell do I base my self worth on? I have like zero confidence at the moment. Is it possible to just exist and simply love myself?

Calming myself down with a note,1,spkezr,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/spkezr/calming_myself_down_with_a_note/,0,"Congratulations, you've won an empty feeling inside, you feel alone, and nobody knows, and if they did who would care? Possibly everyone or a few people, but I don't want to think of what ifs.
What if Miranda did anything she promised?, What if I was raised in a better family, what if I wasn't so easily attached to her and I could just leave her life and let her be with Carlos her bf. 

I'm tired and have nothing, friends who don't feel like friends, except izzy and kemari, and a handful of others I guess, maybe if I were like sophy I'd have friends, she's nice, out going, a bit dramatic but she's a teen aren't we all? Hah

I'm writing these thoughts down to help calm me, and you know what it's working..
Sadly though I can't understand why I feel the way I feel, I want her to be happy, and I want to be mature about this, so what do I do? It feels like she only ever saw me as someone to make out with, and I did with her as well, or so i thought, until i heard she got with him, and now she's going over to his house tomorrow.

Fuck why does that hurt, I'm not in love with her.

This is a common thing too actually, it's kinda funny.
Usually Im the decent looking friend with a better looking friend who is picked before me, and I'm jealous of the winner, the taller skinner better looking one, and you know I'm not angry just to clarify, but there is this feeling in me that feels like I hate him without even knowing him, and I'm just tired is all, I don't hate either of them, that's childish, I will only ever wish the best for her and Carlos and will help as much as I can, but it just hurts, why isn't this fair? Why can't I be normal.

Vent poem thing:

 I hope you break up quickly, I hope you get ran over by a car, I hope you get hit head first by an airplane, I hope you have nothing like me and sit in your room sad that you are lonely because you aren't the person you wish you were, i hope you Get angry at your self to the point that you are breathing hard and crying, because you lost your grandmother, because you have a stomach condition and you own mother won't take you to get help, I hope you sit there and suffer for feeling so angry at two humans who just want to be happy, I hope you understand that it's ok to feel like this because sometimes your thoughts represent your old self, I hope you calm down, mature from this experience and learn to understand that sometimes that's just life, maybe if you asked her to date first who knows, but what's ifs will hurt more than heal, that's why I hope that when you lay down to sleep tonight, you feel nice and tired, I hope that you find love, not in a human being but in yourself so that you don't attach yourself to a girl you met a few months ago, I'm so proud of you, you've come so far and I know you're scared, terrified, petrified of the future, but it won't stop Coming and you will find your way, your mother did and she is less mentally matured then you, you can do this.
I love you Christian/Clint or whatever name you choose to pick once you can legally change it

You can follow your own advice with love.,2,sniy6z,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sniy6z/you_can_follow_your_own_advice_with_love/,0,"#### Pretend you are your friend/partner/sibling/coworker

When someone in my life tells me about something they are butting up against, my instinct is to listen and understand where they are coming from and come from either a solution mindset or a comfort mindset based on what they are asking from me. However, often, when I am butting up against something my advice to myself is to get over it and push through it. So, if this feels true to you - and if this newsletter is doing its job of being centered in community care by honing our individual loving approaches - then maybe as you get used to better caring for yourself, you can see yourself as you see others who come to you for support.¬†

#### Ask yourself first

You know yourself and you know what your gut says. Often, before I‚Äôve asked 12 people their advice on something, I know instinctively what I am going to do. It is wonderful to have people to say things aloud to and try different approaches with. By all means, call your people and listen to them. However, don‚Äôt do this crowdsourcing of advice before you check in with yourself. This is also true for implementing advice columns and lifestyle changes and resolutions. Do what fits well into your life and feels sustaining and sustainable.¬†

#### Spend less time intellectualizing

Give yourself a break from intellectualizing the issue you‚Äôre seeking advice for. Go outside. Propagate your plant. Hem your clothes. Tasks like these tend to lift some of the fog that comes with advice seeking and looking for the right approach to something. No matter how many times you run the different possible outcomes of any one decision, there will be surprise elements handed to you by our chaotic world. So, give yourself a break. Go do something else that feels like care. This will free up space for the answer you are looking for to shimmy up to the surface of your brain.¬†

#### Go to bed¬†

The best, most loving advice I have is to go to bed. You don‚Äôt owe this day any more than you can give it. Just go to bed and let a more rested mind find the advice you are looking for tomorrow.¬†

Being expected to be productive 24/7 is a recipe for terrible mental health,16,skrxhi,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/skrxhi/being_expected_to_be_productive_247_is_a_recipe/,0,"The modern world of work has evolved into a kind of arms race, where people are expected to be constantly productive, more and more optimised, more closely observed. We have internalised this and put ourselves on the clock 24 / 7 - we can‚Äôt relax on a day off because we feel like we‚Äôre supposed to be doing something. I‚Äôve heard from many people when they‚Äôre not feeling well that they feel guilty about not working - I experience this as well. I recovered from covid recently and beat myself up for not being productive enough in work.

This culture is starting to change though. There‚Äôs been a shift recently in the balance of power between employers and workers. It‚Äôs great that awareness is rising, poor behaviour from leaders is being challenged and that protecting people‚Äôs wellbeing at work is becoming an important issue. But it really shouldn‚Äôt take millions of people quitting for leaders to wake up and put the mental health of employees at the top of their priority list and there's some very simple things that can be done to change the culture.

Step one is to listen. Work is a much happier place if leaders listen to what employees have to say without judgement, without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing. Its easy to get defensive when people are complaining but that creates an 'us and them' environment. Having a forum where people feel free to express themselves without being shouted down, where their concerns are taken seriously and (where appropriate) acted on goes a lot of the way to addressing discontent. More than anything, people just want to feel listened to and understood.

Step two: letting go. Quit spinning the wheels for a while and figure out what is really important. If that's too big a question, ask - what makes something an important task. Then apply those criteria to the to-do list and do the most important stuff in the time available. Whatever falls off the end of the list, let it go. Poor leadership expects everything to be done. That is not reasonable and is incredibly stress inducing.

And step three is valuing people‚Äôs feelings. Many workplaces have a macho culture where you push on through, you get the job done regardless of the cost. If people get bullied, harassed and shouted at, that's just collateral damage - you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette. No-one wants to work in an environment where their sadness and anxiety are just part of the process. Consciously make wellbeing and mental health part of the decision making process for how work gets done, not just something that's added to a corporate document.

And we can do these for ourselves at home as well. Value your peace, your mental health. Make it the most important factor in your decision making. Carve out time for rest and recovery, prioritise tasks in your doing time and don‚Äôt put pressure on yourself to do everything. And of course - stop and listen to your feelings, even your difficult feelings. Give yourself an internal forum where it‚Äôs OK to think what you‚Äôre thinking and OK to feel what you‚Äôre feeling. Doing these simple things does wonders for your mental health.

There is a discussion between 2 Mandalorians, where one explains

the other that Jedis do not attach personally (like Buddist monks) to people and this is their way. A position in total opposition to Mandalorian Creed where the sense of community (even using military means) is the core.

Now, we humans have a high sense of community (whatever this is... political party, family, sports, colleagues, country, human race...),  no attachment in the buddhist sense makes sense ;-), but how do integrate in our own local culture of taking care of our local/global community?",1643997343.0

What is love ? Some random thoughts‚Ä¶,17,sk1r31,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sk1r31/what_is_love_some_random_thoughts/,4,"
Learn to love yourself. Love isn‚Äôt the answer to everything , but self love is. You complete yourself , you don‚Äôt need another being to do that for you. 
Learn to be stable alone 
Learn to fend for yourself
Learn to not rely on anyone for anything in life. You make it in life alone like how you die alone. 
I‚Äôm going to take time for myself. To Learn about myself. To get rid of bad habits. To stop being  that person that believe in everything someone says. Words are just words. I need to emphasise that words are just empty promises. Don‚Äôt listen to no ones false promises. You should just do it yourself. Saves you the heartbreak and disappointment.  
You have to make a plan for yourself. How are you going to achieve stability , both financially and mentally? 


I think I‚Äôm blinded by love. Blinded by false hope. Blinded by false Promises. Blinded by faith and believing in someone else . I‚Äôm trapped in this love. I can‚Äôt get out of it cos I‚Äôm in love. Love is dangerous. Love makes you do things that your wouldn‚Äôt do. Like I find myself questioning myself. I find my self looking at my prior self and thinking it‚Äôs a completely different person. I am changing into a new person. I‚Äôm changing because of love. Love swoops in and blinds you. It‚Äôs clouding my judgment. It‚Äôs got it‚Äôs grasps on me and their dug deep. I can‚Äôt leave because the love is holding me back. It‚Äôs pulling at me and it won‚Äôt let go. Someone‚Äôs I feel like such a stranger. I‚Äôm walking through this path in life and I swear I‚Äôm so lost. I have no sense of direction . There‚Äôs no clear path for me. I‚Äôm just doing what I think I‚Äôm meant to do and stay hopeful at the fact that one day I may not feel so lost anymore. One day I‚Äôll find this happiness that all humans sought out to find. I feel dead. Dead inside. I have to paint a different face on for the world everyday. How pathetic is that. I‚Äôm drifting through this shit life with no purpose and no motivation. I‚Äôm stuck with no true happiness. No sense of direction. Just emotionless , emptiness and sadness . I just feel like crying and letting out a rider of tears.  A sea of tears. Just an endless amount of tears to down rushing down my face.",1643941714.0

Nia: Umm, when an individual is berated for donning makeup (a bit more than what's ""accepted""). It's a way to look down upon people who wear makeup and a venture to induce guilt and hostile sentiments in an individual established on their level of makeup. 

Sana: But likewise people are condemned for not wearing anything as well, it's like Naa ye karo Naa vo(neither this nor that).

Nia: Right, but the concept of makeup shaming privileges genuine beauty and calls out people for enclosing their faces out of insecurity.

Sana: Which may not be the motive. I like the person who I am irrespective of my looks but it's no secret that I cherish buying and using beauty products. My choice of liking make-up doesn't mean that I do not like people who don't wear it.

Nia: Absolutely, kyunki vo tumhari Marzi hai(because it's your choice). It's a subjective preference.

Sana: Makeup is an art that I paint on the canvas of my face because I want to and not to show off or to hide my flaws.

Nia: For me it's therapy. And I don't understand why it's gendered. I mean make-up doesn't have any gender. A lot of our male friends wear them, why is it okay for celebrities but not for us commoners?

Sana: You're right! Is there no way to stop makeup shaming?

Nia: Oh, there is, Sana!

Sana: I guess I shouldn't pay any heed to people who look down on me for my choice of make-up.

Nia: True! But you can't always ignore it, at times you must say that maybe it's not your makeup but their thoughts that's showing.

Sana: I like that one. Or maybe my epic eye roll.

Nia: Hahaha! How about an epic comeback (‚ó†‚Äø‚óï)

Sana: Confidence does help.

Nia: Plus giving yourself the time to get better at it.

Sana: And to be surrounded by supportive and loving friends like you!

Learning to trust again after you‚Äôve been hurt is difficult but necessary - isolation only hurts ourselves,5,sfr0ju,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/sfr0ju/learning_to_trust_again_after_youve_been_hurt_is/,1,"All of us have had the experience of being hurt or feeling betrayed by someone, whether that‚Äôs family, friends or in a relationship. We can feel damaged as a result and decide, consciously or unconsciously that being close to other people is dangerous and to protect ourselves we need to keep others at a distance . Doing this doesn‚Äôt mean that there‚Äôs something wrong with you, as human beings we learned to survive by developing aversions to things that hurt us.

The danger is that we lead a life where even with other people around us we lack a sense of intimacy and connection. Noone can see who we really are because we don‚Äôt want to reveal our true selves and as a result we feel lost, alone and lack the strength and resilience to face our difficult emotions.  Having someone who practices deep listening massively increases our chances of being able to accept our difficult feelings.

So how do we break down the walls and let other people in? Well, it has to start inside ourselves, by accepting our own vulnerability and getting comfortable with that. We can understand and listen to our pain, understand the roots and listen to it, even smile to it if you‚Äôre comfortable. If we can pin down the specific event that led to our way of being, we can choose, if we‚Äôre ready, to understand the suffering and ignorance of others that led to our being hurt. We can choose to forgive that person and over time, let go of our resentment.

Then we can look at the ways we choose to withdraw from other people. Is it when someone tries to get close to us? Is it putting on a front, pretending that we‚Äôre OK when we‚Äôre really not? Is it in a relationship, where we jump to conclusions and get defensive based on our own bad experiences? We can hold these situations in our awareness, smile to them and plant a little flag in them, so that when they come up rather than reacting on autopilot we can stop, breathe and make a conscious choice.

This is a huge amount of work in practice but choosing to let people in is essential to living a happy and fulfilling life. Our experience may have taught us (repeatedly) that other people will hurt you - and at some point you will be hurt again. But living without intimacy is a hard life, living without people knowing the real you is lonely. At some point you have to take a leap of faith and make the conscious decision to open yourself up to people again, even if its scary. Because the sad irony is that when we isolate our true selves from other people, rather than protecting ourselves we hurt ourselves. And you‚Äôre a pretty great person, why shouldn‚Äôt the world experience that?

I took it very personally despite their reassurance that it wasn‚Äôt anything I had done, and I couldn‚Äôt let them go. It especially hurt because for the first time in my life I felt like I was 100% authentically me and didn‚Äôt try to be something I wasn‚Äôt.

Ever since I started using it again I don't feel like I am where I should be. Im 22, going to grad school for digital forensics. Im an engineer at a cybersecurity firm. Where I mainly feel behind is in my love life. I've had only 2 boyfriends before, but I see people my age on FB getting engaged and in relationships and I feel behind. In online dating, I get lots of attention. However, I'm starting to get closer to one guy in particular who has treated me so well so far.

He asked me out in early November. I told him I would let him know when we can go out because I was about to get my on-call schedule for work. I rather do this on a weekend because it would be much easier. Doing it on a weekday for our lunchbreaks may not be feasible as we only get an hour and he's like 30-45 min away from me. Right when the holiday season hit, I got very busy.

I was planning to tell him this month but so much happened in our lives I didn't think it would be a good idea to ask at the moment. He got COVID, luckily he's better now. He also had to help his sister move in one weekend. Then this weekend a snowstorm is hitting. I also started grad school and had to get things off my plate. But I do plan on telling him soon. I've been debating whether to tell him outright or if it comes up in conversation. I don't want to come off as too strong.

I really worry that I am going to mess things up with him, and I'll feel further behind in life. I don't know what he sees in me. I don't think I'm very attractive but he tells me that I'm pretty. Then I go on FB and see my FB friends so happy in relationships while I feel miserable because I don't know the next step to take with this guy. What should I do?",1643293091.0

Doesn't it feel funny?

Its a different brand of melancholy I've not been given the ability to taste yet

But now that is unavoidable in my mouth the flavor is quick to overwhelm my senses like bold winter mints that make your eyes water and wilt and it feels funny 

Like laughing until you cry

And now im crying so hard im laughing i told you

What do you tell yourself when you've done something wrong?,6,scpaov,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/scpaov/what_do_you_tell_yourself_when_youve_done/,2,"When you've done something clearly wrong with your moral compass. Like lying out of fear of someone else's reaction or fear of consequences.

I got positive to covid test results yesterday. I panicked a little because I received them while eating with my elderly grandparents. I also remembered that I went out with friends on Saturday. I didn't had symptoms, and even a doctor told me I didn't have covid earlier that week.

I freaked a little because my grandparents have health issues, my friends are planning a trip next week and are taking care of themselves to avoid covid, and my parents are always on my back when I go out (even before covid; they'd loooove a fkn excuse to blackmail me out of going out).

So I said I came out negative at the table. I felt terribly that I lied. Specially because I did it out of fear. I sent a message to my therapist to ask for advice and she explained to me that I was mixing 2 things.

1. The correct responsible thing to do, telling them so they can take care of themselves. What I do. 

And 2. Whatever their reaction may be. What others do.

So I thought about it and came out clean. I said I misread it and told everyone. Nobody had a bad reaction, most people were like ""oh, thanks for telling me"". My friends weren't even worried about it. Even my dad wasn't too much of an a-hole.

Still, I feel bad that I didn't do that in the first place. I regret having given in to fear. I still feel like I messed up. Idk, I've been under a lot of stress lately. Going back to my question, what do you say to yourself when you've messed up?",1643148567.0

"For our mental health garden to bloom, we need to water the right seeds",8,saxwy6,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/saxwy6/for_our_mental_health_garden_to_bloom_we_need_to/,0,"As human beings we have future worries that make us feel anxious and regrets from the past that make us feel sad and angry. This is perfectly normal but the challenge arises when we water the seeds of those emotions - they can grow out of proportion and our lovely mental health garden is covered in brambles.

What do we mean by watering the seeds? In the practice of mindfulness, the little choices that we make every day water different seeds. Some choices water the seeds of joy and freedom, ideally we want to do more of this. Some choices water the seeds of resentment and fear, we want to do less of this. A lot of the time we don‚Äôt realise that we‚Äôre doing it - for example if we choose to stay up late rather than getting a good nights sleep we‚Äôre watering the seeds of our difficult emotions. Drinking too much caffeine or alcohol can do this, as can reading social media or articles or watching TV. 

Only you can know the choices you make that water the seeds and this has to start with awareness. Train yourself to practice awareness as much as you can through the day, you can do this my setting an hourly chime on your phone where you stop, breathe and notice the choices you have in front of you, so rather than being on autopilot you can make an active decision that water the seeds of happiness. This can include chatting with a friend, painting, yoga -  the things that you enjoy doing that bring you back to the present moment and your current experience rather than distracting you.

Of course, even with watering the right seeds, difficult emotions arise. We‚Äôre not robots and its not reasonable to expect yourself to be calm and happy all the time. But when we notice fear, sadness or anger arising we can choose to be kind to ourselves and tend to these feelings with love and compassion. 

Thich Nhat Hanh says, 'there you are, my old friend,' when a difficult emotion arises. We can smile to our anger, smile to our fear and even our sadness; welcome them in rather than shut them out. Listen to what they have to say without agreeing, disagreeing or judging. Sitting with them like you would a friend who was upset; and when they‚Äôre ready, allowing them to leave your awareness. We have so much to learn from our difficult emotions and all they exist to do is help us, protect us and ultimately keep us safe and happy. Its only when we don‚Äôt listen that these powerful emotions take the reins and start driving our actions.

When we‚Äôve become calm again, the next stage is to look at the roots of our anger - if a particular situation or set of words make us feel angry, we can look deeply inside ourselves to find the circumstances that led to feeling this way in this situation. It might be that a difficult experience or someone we had a relationship with in the past has led to assumptions and belief that lead us to react. When we find that, seeing it clearly, not judging that experience or ourselves. Although challenging, this can allow us over time to liberate ourselves from our suffering - and our garden can bloom.

I wanna figure out what I wanna do with my life but it‚Äôs just hard cause I keep going through this issue and cycle of wanting friends, and love and an adventure it‚Äôs all I really want and what I focus my mentality and daydreaming on but I can‚Äôt have that cause I don‚Äôt love myself enough to be able to properly love someone and I don‚Äôt have the courage nor self esteem to to be willing to explore and take risks.

I end up living vicariously through stories. Books and movies 

Like I remember literally last year I read the hobbit and after first chapter I was literally crying cause I related to Bilbo so much .   


And I know I need to focus and find something to support my self, work towards,  educate myself  and I know you aren‚Äôt supposed to compare but it‚Äôs like I look around and see everyone seems like they‚Äôve got it figured out.

And I look at myself and I‚Äôm cutting fruit and Closeing my department like 24 to 30 hrs a week.   

Also like the fucking world is in constant shambles I literally have to take breaks from consuming any real news  because I end up going into the mental matrix trap of Taxes, then going to school somehow graduating said school (with my horrible egregious skills at math and lack of common sense) speaking of which is another thing that frustrates me in life like if I had to describe how I feel about interacting with life and people I describe it like this. I feel like as I‚Äôm perpetually stuck as an 8 year old I feel awkward and like a kid around everyone like if we broke down life into a simple image that image would be a dad working on a car and I‚Äôm the kid who holds the flashlight and just stands there.


Also like I always feel like I‚Äôm in third person like I‚Äôm not me like I‚Äôm controlling me I‚Äôm planning every action writing out my fate typing out the html code the binary and like it feels like I‚Äôm planning every single movement voice I make with my mouth out because cause and affect.

Which is why I really enjoy my moments of just impulsive decisions granted the negative is usually well they‚Äôre is usually a negative outcome but in saying that it‚Äôs freeing in the sense that I feel like I actually made a decision and I didn‚Äôt plan it out or tried to see into the future and calculate the effect of my action.",1642920538.0

Be the Person that the Person you are looking for is looking for,5,s8v97i,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/s8v97i/be_the_person_that_the_person_you_are_looking_for/,0,"Love
The most powerful emotion we have by far,  yet an emotion that many despise- love. Oh love.  How many men out there think all women are the worst? How many women out there think all men are the worst? How do people reach this point with something that is meant to be so amazing? On top of that, what ever happened to valuing marriage? Many of us have seen the crazy divorce statistics out there. Half of all marriages end in divorce. That‚Äôs literally a coin flip to determine your marriage‚Äôs fate. Many Christians believe in seven sacraments that God has given us, one of which being marriage. The word sacrament itself comes from the Latin word sacramentum, which means ‚Äúsacred oath‚Äù and translates to ŒºœÖœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ (mystƒìrion) in Greek which also means ‚Äúmystery‚Äù, referring to how two people becoming one through marriage is one of God‚Äôs divine mysteries. Have we reduced this divine mystery and sacred oath to something that most people think is overrated? Now if you are thinking to yourself, ‚ÄúWhat is someone in their 20s going to teach me about marriage and relationships?‚Äù allow me to make a few points before you click elsewhere.

Love Done Right

Foundation of Confidence

I honestly plan on being single for a while as I continue to find new opportunities to learn and grow. But guess what? I‚Äôve never been happier! Woah, do people do that? Not have a girlfriend/boyfriend and still be happy? What is my plan for the upcoming years? Doing what I want to do more. Learn more. Grow more. Travel more. Take risks more. Be the best person I can be more. Yes, you can still build yourself up in these ways while in a relationship or married, but why wait till then? Take the time while you are single to build yourself up so much that you are proud and confident in who you are, with or without someone else.

Foundation of Neediness

If someone wants a relationship just so they‚Äôre not alone or so they feel better about themselves, they are already setting themselves up for failure. Neediness is a horrible foundation to build a relationship upon. When you get married, being at the disposal of your spouse is your #1 priority. When we go in thinking about it the other way around- that they are supposed to serve me whenever I want, do we quit on them once they don‚Äôt meet our desires? 

Neediness is not the only thing that exposes itself in relationships however. Having someone else that you share life moments with amplifies everything. The good becomes great and the bad becomes horrible. I‚Äôve heard it said before that there is no such thing as marriage problems. There are problems, and then people get married. If someone has a problem that they‚Äôre dealing with or a character flaw or anything they think their partner will help fix, they are in for a rude awakening. Is being in a relationship an exciting and joyful thing? Yes. It is also a meaningful thing. A meaningful and valuable thing that should be prepared for and done right if you want to make the most of it. 

So why listen to me, some young single dude about relationships and marriage? I‚Äôve seen so many people whose entire morale depends on attention from the opposite sex. I would know, considering that was me for a long time in my life. It‚Äôs a sad thing to see with so many people. I want to see anyone who feels this way grow bigger than it. I want to see you so happy with your independent life that you don‚Äôt really care when a relationship comes along (Some of the strongest relationships I have seen started when it was one of the last things on the couple‚Äôs minds). I want you to spend less time anxiously wondering when the perfect person is gonna come knocking at your door. Instead, spend more time thinking about what you can do now to attract someone like that into your life. I want to set you up for the best relationship you could ever possibly have.  If you dream of one day of feeling the greatness of this divine mystery, welcome to Relationships!

Last summer I went on a ""date"" (it felt more like outing with a new friend) with this one guy I met on my friends birthday party. It went well but in the end I felt it was going nowhere and it seemed the guy wasnt really mature so our personalities wouldnt work well together.

I always think about it and get kind of regretful thoughts? 
Like should I have done something different? Should I have taken the only chance I got? Didnt I make a mistake of not pursuing this relationship, if no one ever sees you romantically or show interest?
On the other hand I really feel we wouldnt get on well...

Last night I was talking to my friend about it and he said that it seems like it is coming from a place of self doubt.. And I feel like it is. I have always had a problem with seeing myself as a person someone would love.. I am confident in my looks and personality so it doesnt really make sense in my head.

""Do not love yourself. Love is irrational, and is the gauge by which you relate to the world and others  in it. It is relative in the most literal sense. It is so reflective of the transcendental self that it cannot be reasonably applied to the  self; such attempts boil to narcissism.

""The self is fundamentally transcendental; its essence lies at the event horizon of our self-conception in each moment. One can truly know nothing of something so intangible, so dynamic, so ever-changing well enough to either love or hate it. That which we feel of our condition and situation is genuine, but cannot be ascribed to one's essence as a definite attribute.

How Do I Love Myself? (THE START OF A JOURNEY TO THAT DIFFICULT QUESTION),5,s5bkea,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/s5bkea/how_do_i_love_myself_the_start_of_a_journey_to/,3,"Last September, I started my first relationship. I‚Äôm a 21 (F) virgin. He‚Äôs (24) my first everything. He‚Äôs the first person I went on a date with. The first guy who held my hand, to hug, to kiss. My first relationship.

We never had sex even though we were close to doing that multiple times, last night he even pulled on the condom but I got scared and he never pressured me. Just kissed me offered dinner at a casual sit-down restaurant. I always ‚Äúaccidentally,‚Äù told him I loved him every time I left or he kissed me. At first, I thought it was always just a bunch of excuses to tell him I never meant it. Like I thought it was always an accident because ‚ÄúI love you ‚Äú to my friends and family. 

But I realized last night, those weren‚Äôt accidents I do love him. 

Background on me: 
I was SA as a child. I don‚Äôt remember but I know deep down it happened. But my whole family doesn‚Äôt believe me except my immediate (parents/siblings). I went to the police and the case closed because there was not enough physical evidence which the department feel bad. Everyone who ever accused that family member always been silenced and didn‚Äôt approach the police. (Raised in a monstrous cult.) I didn‚Äôt have it as bad but not better. Traumatized, neglected, and abused physically, sexually, and emotionally. I have a lot of baggage and I admit I hate myself.

Bf‚Äôs background: 
His first love and ex-fianc√© tragically left because of the stage for cancer that sadly couldn‚Äôt be prevented. I‚Äôm his first solid relationship in a while. Probably in years. 

Last night my background came up and sometimes I talk but never go into detail. Lately, I have been hurting a lot. I relapsed from self-harm, came back from 72 hours during Christmas Eve, which triggered my PTSD too much. And now I‚Äôm only working on 2-4 hours of sleep because my nightmares have gotten worse. Randomly I‚Äôm crashing down as he watched. I‚Äôm choking up, telling random details that are traumatic and are more intense than I ever told my mom or sister.  

After I was done, I shrugged everything off even though I was close to tears. He said I never deserved any of that which I just replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just life. It builds character.‚Äù which is what I always said even as a preteen to numb the pain. He turns off the music and looks at me and says ‚ÄúNo child should ever go through that. You‚Äôre so kind you don‚Äôt deserve any of that.‚Äù He hugged me tight and I didn‚Äôt know I was sobbing until it was too hard to breathe, he was touching my hair and I couldn‚Äôt stop choking. 

When I calmed down, he looked at me and told me I‚Äôll get through this because I‚Äôm strong, ‚ÄúLife is hard. If it was easy everyone would do it.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know I told him I was in love with him. I declared how I always felt. After what seemed to be a five-minute speech. I waited as he thought about what I said. I quickly said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to say it. Maybe I don‚Äôt know what true love is because you‚Äôre my first experience maybe I‚Äôm just mixing it up.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to feel rejection so I put that out there and I felt so stupid. 

He told me that he cares deeply for me. That he knows how he feels but he just doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs fully there yet. Because he doesn‚Äôt want to say it until he knows with his full heart. ‚ÄúI kept thinking this it. He‚Äôs gonna dump me and I put everything out there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can tell how much you love me. Your feelings are real. I can feel how much you love me. From what I can tell you do. Don‚Äôt invalidate yourself. I want you to love yourself first.‚Äù 

He told me he wants me to take all that love I have for him and convert it to love for myself. Because I‚Äôm a person too. He kept saying if something were to happen. If he was to go randomly leave right now, can I handle it? If he were to leave and I‚Äôll be by myself. Can I be okay? Will I be okay? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to disappear and you‚Äôve become codependent. You can‚Äôt survive with me. Waking up and thinking the person you thought you love is gone and you have to live by yourself-‚Äú I can tell he was talking based on experience.

I nodded and ordered an Uber. I felt sick. We ended our last conversations said our goodbyes. I know we didn‚Äôt break up but it hurts knowing this about myself. I don‚Äôt know how I feel. I know I don‚Äôt feel rejected more relieved that he‚Äôs still growing to love me. I feel more embarrassed and humiliated. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have told him all that. Would have changed his reaction? Is this an excuse so he can let me down gently? I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs kinda there it feels like I didn‚Äôt have closure again. I know I have to love myself for myself. And I‚Äôm not doing it for him. But I practiced for years and thought maybe it‚Äôs just not possible. Maybe I could never love myself and I‚Äôm okay with that.

I know eventually, I have to try again. But how do you even learn to love yourself, when your whole life you never felt it. The first man you loved as a child, was disgusting and wrong. The family who raised you didn‚Äôt love you, was toxic, and loved with conditions. Nobody ever complimented you. The man you loved which was disgusting, called you ugly, stupid and fat, physically hurt you at one point that you couldn‚Äôt walk. Sexually abused you and slept with you for so long you don‚Äôt know how it started. How do you even start to love yourself?",1642338617.0

High achievers may be looked up to but they‚Äôre not necessarily happy,12,s4l1hm,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/s4l1hm/high_achievers_may_be_looked_up_to_but_theyre_not/,1,"If you listen to podcasts, you‚Äôve probably come across many with the theme of high achievement, where they interview Olympians and businessmen to extract the secrets of their stellar success. There‚Äôs an inherent bias of course with this kind of reporting as there‚Äôs thousands and thousands of people just as talented as them who didn‚Äôt make it for whatever reason - mostly luck and their starting position in life. But we are consistently presented with the idea that we need to be more than we are, that somehow we‚Äôre not enough next to these supermen and women and we could be like them if we only hustle more. 

We‚Äôre bombarded every day in Western culture with things that we need to possess or achieve in order to be happy. The advertising industry is built on this idea - buy this car and you‚Äôll be more attractive, buy this drink and you‚Äôll have a great time. We have to buy something, we have to do something, we have to be something else in order to be happy. Needless to say, this is not great for our mental health and tends to build the vague sense within ourselves that our lives aren‚Äôt enough and we become dissatisfied with everything around us. The idea of striving for more is portrayed as a positive thing in the West, but it‚Äôs a recipe for suffering.  

Happiness is a practice, its a way, its a path we walk every day rather than something that is bestowed on us when we have enough possessions or we‚Äôve risen to a position of power. What we might find, in fact, is that when we achieve what we think we have to to be happy we feel a fleeting sense of elation replaced by emptiness. Emptiness that we try to fill with consumption. We then look for the next thing to strive for and get caught up in a cycle of dissatisfaction. I would argue that rather than be envied, we should feel sorry for those who have had a constant drive to achieve imposed on them. 

 So how do we walk the path of happiness? The first step is to let go of those things we think we need, we call them attachments in the practice. To let go of them we need to identify them, and we can recognise attachments when we feel fear, anger or sadness. Underneath these difficult emotions is something we strive for - for example if we feel anxious about public speaking (like I do) then its because we‚Äôre attached to what people think of us. Identifying these and meditating on them can start to release us from their grip. 

Once we start to surface and let go of the things we think we need to be happy, we can start do the actual work of being happy, which is grounding yourself in the present moment through practising meditation, enjoying the world in front of you through focusing your awareness and feeling gratitude. Gratitude is the one common psychological trait among happy people. All of us feel a certain amount of gratitude at specific times - like when someone does something unexpected and nice for us. But to develop your mindfulness practice you need to fully experience your world in this moment and feel gratitude as much of the time as possible.

We can be grateful for the important things in our life - the people we love, or our health. Practicing being thankful works in the same way as our usual mindfulness, training our minds with a guided meditation or stopping every so often during the day to notice what's going on. Its in these moments we can draw happiness from the world in front of us, whether big or small. This might be sitting down in a comfortable chair, walking in the park or when you see a bird land in the garden. If you train your awareness regularly you can be more attuned to these small moments of happiness and let go of the idea of needing to me more than what you are or anywhere else than right here, right now.

Travel light,5,s47epv,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/s47epv/travel_light/,1,"Currently reading, Unfu*k Yourself, and came across these two words. I sat on them. I understood what they meant, but I was searching for the reason they were glaring at me. My head space has been consumed with reflection on my recent breakup, and it pulled me there once again. I realized that while reflection can be a useful tool to help us gain clarity, it has to be used at the right time, and this was not the time for reflection. Allow yourself to heal first. Unburden yourself of external questions, and instead focus your energy internally. I‚Äôve found vulnerability to be a back door to confront your negative internal monologue. It‚Äôs a place where your ego will desperately scratch and claw to be your resounding inner voice, but if you remain steadfast, and call that bitch out, you‚Äôll allow yourself the opportunity to discover a far deeper understanding of what holds you in a negative space. For me, it was the realization that I‚Äôve placed my happiness in the hands of others. My value was coming from someone else wanting me. So when that‚Äôs stripped away, poof, I have no value.

Fixing that all begins with honesty. I had to be brutally honest with myself to see the error of my ways. It isn‚Äôt until we recognize and take responsibility for the root of our emotions that we can begin to heal them successfully. I believe self love will follow.

Recognize when reflection is holding you in a negative space. Turn inward to discover your deeper self. Ask yourself hard questions. Be honest. Prioritize yourself. Give yourself time to heal and mend those feelings and emotions. Unburden yourself. Travel light.",1642207441.0

I always hear when I go on the internet that before I pursue a relationship, I should try to love myself but I just can't. I hate a bunch of aspects about me even when they aren't problems. I'm 5'5 1/2, never had a real girlfriend or even went on a date or even hung out with a friend outside of school and I'm 2 years from finishing highschool having not done so many things. I keep hoping and praying for this girl to come out of nowhere and bring out my positives since I can't do it myself and I don't have the confidence to try and at least walk up to a girl and hold a conversation. At the same time I hate how I treat my life as worse than it is since I actually have a nice life with a few small but non permanent problems. I just see these people living happier lives and I just get jealous and I want what they have and while I obviously know I have to work for it, I just can't help but grow bitter even when I learned shit like highschool relationships and stuff like that almost never work out. Aside from this, I don't know where to start or how to motivate myself to change since while I love my family and I know they would be there for me, they wouldn't understand, at all. I might not be as bad as I think since I'm not suicidal and I don't self-harm but I just feel alone despite the fact I keep getting blessed with so many things. Maybe I have a bigger ego than I think or I can't leave behind the fantasy world of I should have everything but can someone talk to me and tell me what could be wrong? Thank you if you read this and sorry it's so long. Also no offense but I don't want to hear go to a therapist. We're strapped for money so we don't have therapist money. I'll admit it though, I'm spoiled so my grandparents never force me to do much aside from do good in school and never let myself be treated poorly.

Edit:Ok I think I can attribute my problems from tv shows, movies and all these media standards that basically tell me if I never been on a date that I'm a fucking loser and at times I'm ok with my current life with knowledge that I can make things better and times where I hate myself, the way I live, and think I deserve more when I should be more appreciative for what I got and shouldn't think I need to be this or that to be happy.

We can interrupt a spiraling mind with love.,15,s1esoi,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/s1esoi/we_can_interrupt_a_spiraling_mind_with_love/,0,"Sometimes the brain feels like mush and sometimes it feels like a perfectly constructed machine. Sometimes the brain feels like it is wrapped in fog, and sometimes it feels like it is on a spiral racetrack heading south. When your brain is spiraling, you can lovingly manage and interrupt the spiral. You don‚Äôt have to travel where your mind wants to take you, especially if it is intent on a crash landing into a dark cave of shame, fear, or regret.¬†¬†¬†

#### Do what soothes you

Your ability to exit a spiraling mind depends on diverting your attention and energy to things that soothe you. This might come in the form of movement, bathing, breathing exercises, creating, or whatever grounds you. The tough part here is that often, when the mind is caught up in a tornado of thoughts, it can be difficult to motivate yourself to get up and change what you are doing. It is worth doing what you don‚Äôt want to do in these moments. Interruption is your best defense against a deepening spiral.¬†

#### Don‚Äôt feed into the negative thinking

Often, when the mind takes off, it is tempting to follow it. Your brain becomes a ravenous gremlin that feeds off of fatalistic thinking. As much as you can, avoid feeding the spiraling mind. If it is thinking of a worst-case scenario, you don‚Äôt have to give it more to play with. This isn‚Äôt Texas Hold‚Äôem. You don‚Äôt need the best hand to win. What you need is to leave the table and refuse to play.¬†

#### Keep taking care of yourself

When the brain goes awry, it is important to keep taking care of your basic needs. Nourish yourself, clean yourself and your surroundings, move in a way that feels good to you. Stick to your schedule as much as you can. This daily ritual will be a reminder that you can do what you set out to do. It gives you power over your spiraling mind to stay in touch with what is meaningful to your daily practice of living.¬†

#### Look at the facts on the ground

A short, curt message from your boss doesn‚Äôt mean your career is doomed. An unpleasant moment with a friend or partner doesn‚Äôt carry much significance unless you assign it meaning. When the mind wants to overanalyze, you can interrupt with the facts on the ground. Remind yourself that you are good at your job. Think of times when you have been a warm, supportive partner or friend. For every thought your spiraling mind presents, counter it with a piece of evidence to the contrary that you know to be true.¬†

#### Speak it out loud

Often, the best way to improve your headspace is to get out of your head. When you speak aloud what is troubling you, the mere act of speaking can take some of the heaviness out of it. If you feel comfortable, you can share the spiral with someone you trust and they can help you to find the facts that might be eluding you. If you prefer to write, do that. Just do something that gets you out of your head.

I've had a lifelong fear of public speaking - I sat there in my seat waiting to be called, all of the things that could go wrong passing through my mind when I remembered Thich Nhat Hanh's words: ‚ÄúBreathing in, I arrive in my body.‚Äù And after some mindful breaths, I was back - back in the present moment, back from the catastrophic future that I has created in my head. 

 All of us breathe, its something we do all the time, so it‚Äôs a very powerful link to the present moment. And the present moment is the only place where we can be happy. We‚Äôre not happy when we‚Äôre worrying about the future, we‚Äôre not happy when we‚Äôre regretting the past. Breathing is our anchor to the here and now, its something we can turn to at any moment when we‚Äôre feeling stressed or angry or sad. In the practice we call this returning to the breath and we train ourselves to do this when things are going well, no big emergencies so that when a pipe bursts in the house or we have to speak in front of a crowd of people we can reduce the impact that difficult emotions have on us. The breath is an opportunity for us to stop, let go of the future and past, return to the present moment and notice all of the different dimensions of our breathing. 

 Why is breathing so important and why does it work? Returning to the breath calms us, allows us to take a step back and observe how we‚Äôre feeling rather than being swept away. The breath might seem boring, mundane - but an important part of the practice of mindfulness is to focus on the everyday and take joy from simply being alive. The key thing to remember is that its focusing our awareness on the breath, rather than the breath itself, that liberates us. Focusing on the steadiness, the repetitiveness of the breath gives us a break from constant stimulation of work, TV, the kids and most of all ourselves and our own thoughts; it allows our mind to settle. When we let our mind settle it becomes calm, calmness leads to insight into our suffering. Letting go of suffering leads us to peace; when we‚Äôre peaceful we‚Äôre more compassionate and compassion creates a kinder world. And it all starts with your breath in this moment.

Hi, I'm sorry but I'm new and am seeking advice on how to love my body again. Half a year ago, I got out of a relationship where the boy in question abused my physically and sexually all while emotionally manipulating me so he could, and I quote ""keep enjoying the experience"". 

I wont get into it a lot bc I honestly dont like to think about it but ever since, I have been struggling to love myself and have to keep reaffirming every day to  myself that I am safe and that I am enough. It has also triggered my anxiety and depression.

Wondering if anyone has any ideas, I would be very grateful.‚ù§

Wisdom - very topical to self love and self care.,5,rw0dub,selflove,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTKLRlgc69s,0,,1641318989.0
We can face setbacks with love.,12,rvsu1b,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rvsu1b/we_can_face_setbacks_with_love/,0,"We are taught about time as a straight line. PowerPoint presentations and history books depict ‚Äúprogress‚Äù as a linear, forward journey. Alas, as we grow into the person we want to become, we are faced with setbacks. These setbacks can feel like disruptions to the narrow path forward we thought we were on. There is, of course, the good news that facing setbacks with love will allow you to reframe the experience as a time for perspective that offers a full view of your history and future.

#### Reframe

Try to view setbacks as an important part of life on a winding road, rather than as an interruption to your march forward. The time it takes to recover from a setback isn‚Äôt time wasted. It is an exercise of learning, of perspective, and of meeting new parts of yourself. This is a time when you can pick up clues and tricks for future setbacks. Frame this time differently and lovingly, and watch it transform from a hindrance to an asset. This process is especially important when setbacks aren‚Äôt just personal, but are communal (think election results, pandemics, etc.). When a setback feels wildly out of your control, you need to be able to depend on your reframing skills to see the time as necessary, worthwhile, transformational. The reality of a setback is neutral, it is our framing that assigns it value, so be mindful of the frame you choose.¬†

#### Be curious

So much of this newsletter is devoted to using curiosity as a tool for approaching life lovingly. Curiosity is our ticket to extracting levity from the heaviness of circumstance. Allow yourself to be curious about what your setbacks have to offer. Curiosity will keep your mind occupied so that you don‚Äôt descend into anxious fatalistic thinking. Some questions to keep yourself curious are:

* Why does this setback feel disruptive?¬†
* What assumptions am I making about this setback?
* How could I use this time to learn about myself? Others?
* How have I handled similar setbacks in the past?
* What can I learn from this time that can guide me going forward?

#### Rest

Lovingly view these times as inevitable. Don‚Äôt force yourself to ignore the impact of a setback and trudge ahead despite it. Once you have reframed the experience as one of growth and learning, allow yourself to sit in it, rest in it, and allow things to be as they are. A restful mindset will protect you from a resistant mindset.¬†

#### Call people whose perspective you appreciate

A setback can cause tunnel vision. It is hard to see behind, beyond, and beneath the present moment when it feels like you‚Äôve been pushed off course. In order to find a bit of perspective, call someone who can show you things through their eyes. If possible, call someone who has seen you through past deviations from your plan. Their compassion will be helpful. Even if they don‚Äôt quite know what to say, the process naming your current challenge will likely be helpful for you. Often, we don‚Äôt know something is true until it falls out of our mouths. The person you call can remind you of where you have been, and they can remind you that they believe in the future you want for yourself.¬†

#### Look backward to look forward

The next hiccup in your journey certainly isn‚Äôt the first you‚Äôve experienced and certainly won‚Äôt be the last. Use this time to look back at how you‚Äôve learned from setbacks in the past, and how you would like to learn from this moment to prepare for the future. Spend time zooming out and zooming back in to see life as one long narrative arc made up of shorter stories. Gather nuggets of wisdom so that you have substantive reminders of the fruits of this time.

Physical goals vs mental health,1,rvkaum,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rvkaum/physical_goals_vs_mental_health/,1,"Ok so there is a lot of background story here, I hope you‚Äôll take the time to read it :)
I‚Äôm an 18 year old female, never was overweight but struggled with anorexia from 14 to ~15.
I first started exercising during that time as a punishment for eating (/because of my bad body image), once I recovered from my ED I stopped exercising+ gained back weight. I wasn‚Äôt counting calories anymore but wasn‚Äôt that healthy in general.
So when I was 16, I started counting again and exercising more, I lost some weight and got into lifting, with an ambitious but not disordered mindset.
I kept going like that until I decided to do a cut (aka diet) in spring of 2021, during that cut I lost a ton of weight, but I was also being extremely strict with my diet and exercise, my body image got worse again and I started obsessing over my looks. I also weighed myself again, which negatively influenced my mental health 2. When I ended my cut, I ate at maintenance and healthy, my relationship with food got better and I stopped tracking calories to go back to intuitive eating.
My body basically bounced back to (almost) what it was like before my cut, just with more muscle and therefore probably less fat. 
I gained 2cm on my waist and 10cm on my hips compared to the end of the cut, so quite a lot.
(My measurements are 85-62-102 now).
.
The conflict I‚Äôm dealing with right now is that on one hand, I want to improve myself physically, which happened in summer. I had stronger abs (they are still there now, just not all day anymore) and fitted into smaller clothes, especially finding pants that fit is tough now.
On the other hand I want to improve myself internally and find a body and diet that‚Äôs sustainable and healthy longterm. I know that my current, bigger body isn‚Äôt unhealthy in any way, and the fact that I fall back into it whenever I eat healthy, whole foods at around maintenance calories might indicate that this is where I‚Äôm supposed to be.
The fact that I‚Äôm still so focused on being as lean and small as possible disappoints me in a way as my ‚Äúultimate mental health goal‚Äù always was to accept and love myself the way I am. Additionally, I‚Äôve been getting a ton of compliments on my butt now, so apparently I‚Äôm not really out of shape- just in a different shape. 
.
I know that this is quite a complex question, which is why it keeps me up at night right now. I feel like I want to work on myself, but the 2 aspects of aesthetics (or let‚Äôs say the lean aesthetic which I‚Äôm still chasing after) and selflove just don‚Äôt seem to be compatible for me, or atleast not yet.
.
Has anyone here experienced a similar situation? How would you set the priorities here? 
I know that I have to decide for myself in the end, but just getting some feedback from people who aren‚Äôt directly involved would be great.",1641266646.0

Day 3 of self love,26,ruuk0q,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/ruuk0q/day_3_of_self_love/,9,"I am on third day of my self love journey. On this journey I am treating myself as I treat my loved ones. 

I started this journey when I got a rejection from my crush. She said "" don't message me"". I simply deleted everything related to her. Her number, communication with her. Later I thought I have done so much for that's one person who didn't care about my existence. She didn't even asked for once how am I doing? Am I feeling good??. I was the one who initiated conversation every time and I was the one who planned and paid for every hang out. Though I never regret them but I what I felt us why am I doing somuch for a person who don't even appreciate my presence. Later as a challenge  I took up this journey.

To be honest I never gave time myself. I was always people pleaser who went great lengths to please others. I always said no to my desires thinking they might be bad or what others think of me. 

The day I got on this challenge, j said to myself that every day I buy something I loved to eat but always stopped or suppressed. First day I bought chips. It felt very good. Next day I thought to buy ice-cream for myself but didn't get it as shops were closed. But I persisted and searched for every place and finally got it after 2 hours. I liked it because for the first time in my life I was persistent to do something for my self without self criticism. Yesterday I bought a chocolate and it was really tasty. 

I am trying to go for a run everyday to improve my physical body which I always neglected in past. This time less self criticism and more compassion. I started to write journal.

Kind words made all the difference,22,rtbr1c,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rtbr1c/kind_words_made_all_the_difference/,5,"I've been depressed for 3 to 4 years. my long term girlfriend left me over it and got ugly about it, accusing me of horrible things to validate her choice. she took all of my friends, which was  everything to me. i moved back to my home state to be with my father who's 72. a year later his health started to decline rapidly due to colon cancer. a couple months later here i am as his full-time caregiver. 

I've spent a long time hating myself, knowing all of my problems, having no motivation to fix them, no desire for what the future could offer, no hope or excitement or happiness in my life. i was sure that if people apparently hated me so much, then they must be right about me. i leaned into their assumptions and became the lazy loser with no ambition that they thought i was. 

As soon as my father needed my help, i was there to get him things or shop for him or drive him places. this wasnt anything special in my mind, i was doing the bare minimum that any child should do for their parent. and then he got worse, and worse, and worse. he was put on oxygen and signed up for hospice (they do basically nothing for him). soon he was unable to walk far enough to get the things he needs. so instead of my cave with my tv and pc, i began staying in the living room with him to be more accessible and helpful. it became clear to us that he was not going to get better, and that this was a one way trip. he spent a lot of time asking me questions to get to know me better. i told him he already knows everything about me that i do. because theres nothing to me. a careless brain in a meat puppet. no essence. 

we talked and talked, reminisced, planned. he was soon unable to walk or talk for more than a couple minutes. his struggle to breathe was giving him severe anxiety and panic attacks. i was helpless in those times and couldnt stand it. every day i wondered how in the hell i was going to be able to take any more of this. 

he apologized constantly.. every couple minutes at the most, for being a burden to me. i couldnt convince him that this is what i want to be doing.. he just couldnt understand that. he's never asked for help in his life. but he has helped thousands. half of his life and money was spent on the welfare and assistance of others. so he was severely upset that i was having to help him with so much. i never slept for more than 2 hours at a time for a couple months. 

he noticed that i never once complained or refused to help, even with the smallest of tasks. and he was so surprised. every single time someone came to visit or call on the phone, he would spend most of the time telling them how great of job im doing, and how grateful and impressed he was in me and my maturity with the situation. i did all of his legal work after a lot of research, and through dozens of documents, was able to get every single one of his assets out of his estate in order to avoid probate.. he was beyond impressed, as were the witnesses and the notary and his family and anyone who heard of it. 

this whole time, i could not understand why i was getting so much praise. im just doing my job as a son. I've done the bare minimum in most my endeavors and felt like this was the same even though i couldnt possibly do any more than i did. each time a community member would bring food, they would tell me how impressive I've been. when hospice nurses came, they'd tell me how surprised they are at the job I've done. a couple down the road told me to my face, ""you are an amazing person"".. and i broke down. no one has called me amazing in my life. whenever they see me, i look like a junkie with hollow baggy eyes and no smile whatsoever, bloodshot from no sleep and no energy, due to how long im awake caring for him and also my impending grief. but no visitor would fail to tell me every time how great and fantastic I've been. i felt like i was lying somehow. because i knew for sure that deep down im a bad person. theyre seeing a lie if they think im so great. 

a month or so of this, and i realized that maybe im the one who's wrong. maybe theyre right, and i am impressive or great. it feels so wrong for me to think that way. for so long ive known for a fact that im a useless person. i value the importance of perspective. i know that almost anyones opinion of anything is understandable through a different perspective. so i thought that maybe, through their unbiased perspective, they know the truth about me. could i actually be an amazing person? 

my dad walked into his room one day while i was cooking bacon and eggs, which he never does. after a few minutes i walked into his room, without knocking (which i never do), and he had his shotgun against his forehead, trying to reach the trigger with a stapler. i ripped it out of his hands and he started sobbing. he was convinced that he needed to end the suffering for both of us. that he was too much of a burden on me and needed to relieve it, and his pain. i explained to him that the only reason i havent killed myself, is because there are at least 2 people who still love me, and they would be destroyed if i did. he's one of those 2 people, and if he killed himself, i would probably see it as permission and do the same. i offered him a new perspective, ""what if your mother shot herself, instead of letting you help her at the end like she did. what if you never heard about her condition and need for help, and one day heard about her suicide? how would that have changed your life? do you want that for me?"". we had one of his friends come over to counsel him spiritually since he is quite religious. i never emotionally reacted to this event. im afraid that it'll hit me one day, seeing what i saw. 

in the following weeks, he has gotten to the point of complete helplessness and delirium. he can no longer speak, or stand, or swallow pills or food, or change position, or lift his head and other limbs. i clothe him, i feed him, i put on his catheters, i read to him, i hold his hand, i do everything he needs or wants and dont have a single minute to cook or sleep or clean. which is okay with me. but luckily our religious community noticed and brings us food and comes to sit with him once in a while so i can nap. praising me the entire time. i still dont know how to handle it but i can feel myself changing. i wont come out of this as the same person. without the praise, i would be nothing but tired and even more depressed. hearing 5 times a day that im doing a great job and that im a great person, does something to my mind that 4+ years of introspection and attempted self-help couldnt do. i see now that im doing a good thing, rather than just my duty. i didnt think i was capable of doing something great, or not realizing it if i were. i didnt think i could do any of this. im impressing myself now. if i heard about someone i know doing what im doing, i would have infinite respect and admiration for them. i still dont feel like i deserve that though. its just so hard for me to believe it. im just a sad pathetic loser who happens to love his dad enough to help him when he needs it. but the outside perspective probably knows more about it, and i should trust them. 

maybe i AM incredible, impressive, great, amazing. maybe im not useless. maybe you dont need to know that youre a good person in order to be one. i find myself excited to see who i will be after this experience, what i will be able to accomplish, since what im doing now is apparently so impressive. maybe my life isnt over and maybe there actually is good ahead. maybe i can still be who i wish i was.

I want to find self love this year,9,rtc75y,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rtc75y/i_want_to_find_self_love_this_year/,3,"Sorry this is more of a letter to myself and a blab! This year, I want to find myself, and find things that makes me like myself and feel happy. 

While this was my ‚Äúresolution‚Äù in 2021 as well, I have recent discovered that I am on a spectrum of so called ‚Äúneuro-diversity‚Äù. This explained many of the struggles I have faced over my teens and early 20s involving communication and friendships. I just never felt understood nor accepted, which eventually manifested as self hate.

I will still probably find building friendships a task, but I must take one step at a time, starting with self acceptance and love.

You can do it, me :) I believe in you.",1641014052.0
"When you work on yourself, there's a certain glow about you. When you cultivate self-love, there's a light in you that other people could only DREAM of grasping/comprehending. It's intangible and elusive to them.",31,rt0ul6,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rt0ul6/when_you_work_on_yourself_theres_a_certain_glow/,2,"I attended my niece's birthday party the day after Christmas. Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.

My aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:

""What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!""

My soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.

I started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5'6F, 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.

And so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands/bouquets/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!

Career is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.

One of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered ""more successful"" - fancy titles, high-powered positions/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?

She even said something that really resonated with me: That most people/our society is very ""success""-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards/accolades/honor/fame/power/prestige/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth/personal development/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are/remain dissatisfied with themselves/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.

One of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:

Self-love/contentment/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character. When you have true peace and contentment (no matter what stage you're in), NO ONE can take that away from you.",1640977506.0

Your new years resolution: happiness,2,rt11fd,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rt11fd/your_new_years_resolution_happiness/,0,"New years resolutions are a funny thing - we make a plan for getting fit, saving money or taking up a new hobby. But we tend not to think about our happiness, which is strange - the purpose of taking up a new hobby or getting fit is ultimately that it makes us happy. Why not cut out the middleman and make our aim for the year to be happy? 

Practising mindfulness can help us to do this and it‚Äôs simple to learn. Mindfulness is about focusing 100% of your awareness on whatever you‚Äôre doing, whether that‚Äôs walking, eating or just breathing. That process of training yourself to be aware allows you to start to let go about worries about the future and regrets from the past. Its easy to pick up, but it does need some patience and persistence to develop your practice and see the benefits. Being in the present moment calms us, and lets us focus on the good things right in front of us. When we‚Äôre grateful and present we improve our mood.

This seems like a bunch of easy answers, and mindfulness is often accused of this. If you read some news articles it‚Äôll tell you that mindfulness is either a right wing conspiracy to keep us all placid or a left wing conspiracy to brain wash peoples beliefs and values! But at it‚Äôs most fundamental level mindfulness isn‚Äôt anything more than being present with your experience, meaning that your head is in the here an now. That will lead you to make different choices - better choices - for your wellbeing and mental health, but those choices will be more authentic to your true self.

The key to mindfulness is not to try and achieve a particular state - just practice a little every day and notice the change over the next few weeks as it happen, its about the experience rather than learning a philosophical framework. Jon Kabat Zinn says that when you start to learn mindfulness, rather than talking about it, just get your butt on the cushion and he‚Äôs right. Mindfulness is about practice and experience rather than knowledge.

Is it healthy to indulge in romantic fantasies (even for a woman who has been single her entire life?) - LONG POST,4,rpsw7w,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rpsw7w/is_it_healthy_to_indulge_in_romantic_fantasies/,4,"I'm a girl (28F) who indulges in a lot of romantic fantasies (I'm chronically single - which I'm trying to put a positive spin on and embrace it instead of dreading it).

Men never choose me. The guys I've liked have all been so cruel and bullied me. It's affected my self-esteem. I resent it when other women complain about their relationships because someone still wanted to be with them regardless of how long they were together and how things ended. Most women don't know the pain of never being wanted, of longing and absence. I've always been overlooked. Men have never looked at me. It was always hard seeing my friends getting attention from guys (even though they constantly assure me that male validation/attention does not add value to your life. It is not important). But again, it's easy for them (and most women) to say that because they, at one point or another, have had people notice them. They've been ""picked"".

Rejection comes in all forms, but, I'm talking about as something as personal as a romantic rejection. Everyone says not to take things personally but its still very painful.

How do I process and deal with it in a healthy way?

I've been dealing with feelings of hurt, disappointment, and even anger. Is this normal?

Earlier this year (I'm 28F and have never been in a relationship) I was introduced to a guy (31M for a courtship with the end goal as marriage, we met through family friends. His mom has always really liked me for her son) and we hit it off when we met. Although I will say that my dad was not happy about it. My dad felt something was not right. He didn't like the guy when my family met him. (he thinks the family is more cheap instead of extremely frugal). So this guy wanted my number (it was the first time this happened). He initiated the texts (and I was in awe this was happening because no guy ever had wanted to get to know me before). Things were fine but then he started telling me things like he's robotic and has absolutely no friends (he's in his early 30s) - but only close to his parents and cousin (who is like his older sister). He began grilling me right away about how many kids I wanted, what my ideal family situation looked like, and he wanted to identify areas of conflict in a relationship. I went along with it because I didn't know any better. He asked me if I wanted nannies for children and if the kids should have medications/psychiatrists.

He's very spiritual (prays a lot) and volunteers at animal shelters and horse farms. He enjoyed outdoor activities like hiking and biking (esp. mountain biking) and going to remote locations in other parts of the world to hike there and meet the local population (and I thought this was cool and something I would have loved to have done with him) - but he also kept going on about barebones vacations (which I've never done) and kept emphasizing bargain hunting (he told me I could buy a table for $1000 instead of $20,000 - but I never named any prices - I just told him how lovely it would be to spend some money on decorative items for our home. I've always envisioned a beautiful house once I'm married. There's nothing wrong with wanting nice things, right? I even told him what if wanted to buy a lovely dress (I would need a nice wardrobe for work anyway) to get dolled up for myself and for him too (I think there's nothing wrong with wanting to look nice for your spouse also). But when I said that, he said he has experience with people who do things for appearances sake and he wholeheartedly disagrees with this way of life.

I mentioned that going out to eat once a week (and treating myself off and on with a nice gift, etc.) is something I've always done. That just because I grew up comfortable does not mean that I'm an impulsive buyer/spender. I lived on my own for a few years (while in medical school) and know how to mind and budget money. That family instilled a great respect for money in me. Treating myself is something that I am used to and that I have a right to do. But he said that if he is contributing to the children's college fund while I'm going out to restaurants once a week, there is an imbalance. This was bizarre because I don't think going out for a nice meal once a week would affect the hypothetical children's college fund? He framed it as if it were an ""either-or"" situation. But I pointed out that it doesn't have to be. Why not do both? I did mentioned that going out and treating yourself is healthy. It's something else we could do to spend time together and connect along with hiking/biking/anything else he wanted to do. I did also mentioned that I go out with my parents often and am pampered by them - I didn't mean ""pampered"" in a waiting on me hand and foot kind of way, but spending quality with him, saying and doing thoughtful/loving things. Things were fine up until then and he said he would get back to me (we were texting back and forth everyday) but then I didn't hear from him for 4-5 days which made me upset. When he came back, he reiterated all the points in the previous paragraph and said he was concerned about my expectations of being pampered by a future partner. (I had even made my wants smaller and suggested going out twice a month if that would work. He wasn't receptive to that.)

So when I replied, I reiterated all my points adding to the fact that this money thing seemed like something was unwilling to compromise on, like it was a non-negotiable. I asked him to help me understand him and to give me the same grace, that could find an option that worked for us both. I told him that I really liked him and how willing/open I was to make this work (I really was trying).

He did mentioned that while he was growing up, his family was hand to mouth and he never wanted to be hungry for money ever again. But he ended up doing well for himself. He makes 200K+ per year and owns 3 homes (he works at the intersection of IT/finances). I didn't understand why me wanting to spend my money was a big deal - I even suggested a ""mine, yours, and ours"" financial arrangement. It's perfectly normal to want to treat yourself or go for a hard-earned vacation, etc. right? I mentioned that he appeared to have an unhealthy relationship with money, which I found unsettling. I also pointed out that he didn't tell me what happened in his last relationship (ended over a year ago and lasted 2 years). He briefly glossed over it and didn't tell me what happened. So I said we could always talk about it later if/when he felt comfortable talking about it. I even gave him a way out and asked if getting to know each other was what he really wanted?

He replied immediately and said he believed my concerns should not be minimized and promised no more excuses and said it was clear that I deserved attention, respect, and respect with the level of communication. He said he felt very lucky to have met me. That I'm genuine and amazing. Possess strength of character, integrity to stand up for my beliefs, and the ability to be myself (which is what he was looking for in a partner). He said that he did not wish to cloud my unsettled feelings with sweet nothings. He said he really does enjoy talking with me and hoped I felt the same about him.

I told him I did. That I did feel the same way. And I really meant every word. So I just reiterated my previous points about the concerns I had (about his views about money and the previous relationship) and said I was eager to keep getting to know him. I also asked him what made him want to pursue marriage/a relationship at this point in time. I asked him to be upfront/honest with me about everything (as I have been with him) rather than me thinking he's hiding something. I said I really wanted to keep getting to know him.

I didn't hear from him again for 3 days.

Then when he came back, he ended it with me and I was left feeling devastated. Like something was dangled and then taken away from me. I was so fond of him. Very fond of him. There was so much more I wanted to know about him and now I will never get the chance to. I found out later (a few months later) that his mom was basically shopping him around and looking for other prospects for him which made me upset and feel bad. My parents keep telling me I didn't miss out on much and I shouldn't need trouble convincing myself. It sucks though. I knew we were basically incompatible (with our lifestyles), but, I wasn't asking for much at all. I wanted to demonstrate to him that I absolutely could be a loving, respectful, communicative, and gracefully-allowing partner. It really hurt. Around the time when he broke it off with me, his dad was diagnosed with cancer. (He was taking good care of his dad those few months he had left). Then his dad passed away 3 months ago. I felt sad to hear that.

A couple weeks ago, my parents went over to his house to pay their respects (his mom, older brother, and older brother's fiancee were there also). He and his older brother do not get along at all. My parents noticed that. His older brother owns a home in another city and goes out to eat at nice places and travels a lot.

So apparently (the guy I was talking to) he saw my parents and didn't even want to talk to them. He ended up leaving the house. I felt so bad when I heard that. When my mom came home she said, ""Yeah...he cut you off cold turkey. I don't think he was as nice as he presented himself to be.""

Still, I felt bad when I heard that.

But she told me to work as hard as I can on my exams, get residency, live my amazing life and shine bright. He didn't deserve me, she says.

Now there's obviously nothing wrong with living in a small house. My mom said their home was like a relic - it's 50 years old. And his dad who passed away, he was the manager of the IRS (so he was doing well for himself financially). I think unfortunately, it was more selfish penny-pinching/being cheap that he subjected his family to instead of not actually having the means. His mom worked (and still does) also.

Despite the obvious discrepancies, I feel sad. I really wanted to see him again.

It didn't last long but I was hoping that I'd continue to learn about him and get to know him. There was so much more I wanted to know. I was left feeling very sad and confused. But now I have to keep focusing on my own life (and right now, that's passing my board exams so I can get into a medical residency program) - a little bit of background, I graduated medical school (in 2019 - and I struggled so much. I failed many exams and even had to repeat a year in school. I'm studying to retake one of my board licensing exams I need for a medical residency. My goal is to be a child psychiatrist. That's my biggest dream. I also have many other dreams as well! To publish a book, start a podcast, paint/sculpture, calligraphy, learn languages, flower-pressing, flower design (making flower garlands/crowns/wreaths/bouquets), cooking/baking, candle-making, etc.

I've been working on myself: Truly prioritizing self-love (which I want to carry into the new year). I lost over 30 lbs this year (working on being the healthiest version of me), and really honing in on my spirituality. I've been going to Church a lot more and spending time in the Bible. It has helped A LOT. God is healing the parts of me that need to be healed. But there are days when I will get tear-eyed and struggle emotionally.

I feel so sad because it really seemed like after this rough patch that things would progress between us. He didn't even give me the chance to show him who I could be. I wanted to truly know him and spend time with him. It bothers me so much. I always wonder what could have been. There are days when feelings of anger and sadness just rise up. I stay in prayer a lot and I try to use these feelings as motivation to improve my own life but there are days when I struggle.

Marriage is a vocation I absolutely hope to be called to one day. It's a desire of my heart. To help with my sadness and grief, I indulge a lot in romantic fantasies - I've been reading this fanfiction about Hades and Persephone. I identify a lot with the main character in the story (she's studying to be a doctor, loves flowers, very attached to her mother, had a sheltered upbringing, etc.) Sometimes...I imagine there's a handsome king of the underworld who is admiring me from afar (he first saw me at a spring festival) and wants to make me the queen of his ""kingdom"" so to speak. He'd be handsome, strong, steadfast, generous, etc. I'd fill his heart with life, love, and light. He'd show me all the magical lands and creatures of his realm. He'd encourage me to want to wear beautiful gowns/fine clothes, decorate our home however I'd like, and spend time in our gardens so that I may make as many flower crowns, garlands, and beautiful bouquets to my heart's content! Idk if there's even a real life equivalent. A girl can only hope...\*sigh\*",1640627280.0

Reframing exercise as self-care,6,ro2jx7,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/ro2jx7/reframing_exercise_as_selfcare/,2,"Trigger warning: body dysmorphia

I've gone through some major (good) changes in my life recently, and I've been under a lot of stress. The one part of my life that I really feel needs urgent improvement now is taking care of my physical health. I eat averagely well, but I don't exercise. I've tried to start many, many times before. I've biked, danced, jogged, walked, done yoga and pilates...and I never continue past about a month. The affect of my lifestyle has become increasingly obvious as I age (I'm 27). I'm out of breath really quickly, I'm clumsier, and my body has also obviously changed shape. My cholesterol and heart rate are high. I've had a couple of health complications/ER visits in the past year. I'm not in terrible shape (I can still do a 8-10 mile hike in a day if I want), but it gives me a lot of anxiety and also a lot of shame. 

I think my problem is that whenever I start an exercise or meal prep routine, I do it to try and impress people in some measurable way (weight loss, pictures of gorgeous prepped meals, how I look in clothes, etc). OR because I'm embarrassed about these changes in my body and I feel like I have to try and pull myself back to the way I looked in high school because if I don't I'm somehow falling short. I logically know this is unreasonable and I'm being too hard on myself, but I can't seem to shake it. 

I get frustrated when change doesn't happen quickly (and I have to confront my insecurities every day) and I compensate by buying clothes that hide my body or just giving up on feeling young, attractive, or strong. 

I think I need to let go of those measures of success and stop chasing external validation. (I recognize the irony of posting here.) But I struggle to see exercise or eating well as self care when it makes me so tired or sore. Like it physically makes me feel bad and it feels more ""caring"" (at least in the short term) to take a nap. 

Has anyone else felt this way, and if so, how did you overcome your insecurities and reframe physical activity/eating better as self care? I want to feel better (and look better, in spite of myself). I want to be healthier and age more slowly. I just can't overcome the hurdle of thinking that if I can't acheive a perfect body, it isn't worth it.

All advice welcome. Thanks in advance.",1640407295.0
Staying cool during family friction this Christmas,16,rnvevm,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rnvevm/staying_cool_during_family_friction_this_christmas/,0,"Its funny how the same sets of genes mixed together in slightly different ways can produce radically different people. We might find it difficult to relate to some members of our family because they have a radically different view of the world. Its also interesting how the same genetic randomness produces people so similar, with the same insecurities and trigger points. Both of these can make sharing a space for a longer period of time difficult.

First, to state the obvious - spend some time working on your calmness, meditating every day. If you are calmer then you‚Äôll be less reactive to what other people say and do.

Secondly, we need to tend to our anger with kindness and compassion. when someone says something unkind, we can stop and take a moment to breathe before we react. Its very easy to fire something back immediately but that rarely helps. Walk away if you need to. Thich Nhat Hanh suggests that when we‚Äôre feeling anger that we don‚Äôt speak for 24 hours. That may not be an option in a house full of people but we can look deeply into our anger and use it to understand what the buttons are in us that were pushed by the comment. This is a great opportunity for us to let go of our suffering - if we understand where those buttons are and what drives them, we can let them go and they can‚Äôt be pushed in the same way again. Meditating on the roots of our anger will help you to gain this insight. When you‚Äôre ready you can tell the person that what they said hurt you.

Finally we can make sure that our own words are kind - we can avoid bringing up subjects that we know will create discord and avoid entering into conversations that are likely to degenerate into arguments. We might feel that when someone is sharing an unpleasant viewpoint that we need to fight it, to show them that they‚Äôre wrong but changing someone‚Äôs mind through arguing with them is really difficult. If anything they tend to dig in, clinging to their viewpoint. If you really have a desire to change someone‚Äôs mind and you believe you can have that conversation without getting angry, you can ask questions that lead them toward the assumptions that underpin their beliefs. But this raises the question - where does your desire to change their mind come from? Meditate on that and then see if you still want to.

But it's hard when you come from a culture (I was born and raised in the United States but my family is of Asian descent) that highly praises and emphasizes honor, awards/accolades, academic success, big-named schools, prestige, power, popularity/fame, riches, status, meeting the stereotypical life milestones by a specific age, etc. I'm trying to break away from this mindset. I am very close with my family, but, I hate that we are part of a community that really is deeply enmeshed in this ideal if you know what I mean. Social events with other Asian folks (people my parents know and their kids who are in their late 20s/30s). I'm in my late 20s (for context), single, unemployed, and living with my parents. Graduated medical school in 2019 but have had to study for licensing exams in order to get a job in my field. These exams have given me a very difficult time. I've never been a good studier/test taker. Always been a mediocre student. I graduated at the bottom 10% of my class. I couldn't get involved in extracurriculars because I failed exams and was very overwhelmed with my rigorous program. Even repeated a year and graduated later than my friends (who are all working). Barely passed my first board and am studying to re-take another exam that I need for medical residency. It's been a difficult journey. This certainly is not how I envisioned my life post graduation. It's taking me so long to get my life together. I feel bad because my parents have supported me (financially and emotionally) throughout my entire journey and it's taking me so long to get my life together. I have heard them a couple times comparing me to other girls my age: ""Look! so and so is your age and almost done with medical residency and she's ready to start her fellowship. She's pregnant with her second child."" or, ""When are you going to hurry up? So and so already has interviews for residency programs.""

I want to be a child psychiatrist more than anything though. I'm just frustrated it's taking longer than I hoped. And besides being a practicing doctor, there is SO MUCH else I want to do in life (publish a book, get into flower design, start a podcast, candle-making, travel, etc.)

But I feel self-conscious and even inadequate about my station in life sometimes. While I do appreciate the time and freedom I have (because of the lack of responsibilities), at social gatherings, people ALWAYS ask what I'm up to. I feel inadequate compared to the other girls my age who are established doctors in training/lawyers/aspiring business magnates/politicians/diplomats/etc. who have gone to or are working for prestigious institutions/programs. Some even married and also with kids. While I have none of that at the moment. A few of the girls are honestly really mean to. They pry and ask about what I'm doing, when I'm applying to residency, what I've been doing since graduation, etc. and they lord it over me what they have - being far along in their medical training, being married, etc. In my interactions, I try not to let my upset feelings show on my face. I try and demonstrate grace congratulating them on their achievements, asking them what they like about work/their spouse/kids, etc. But I still feel bothered on the inside. I want to get to a point where I don't feel provoked by other people no matter what they do/say. I genuinely want to wish them well in their lives (even if they are jerks). Getting to that point is hard because sometimes I feel that it's not fair what they have (or that because they are shitty people that they have success in life). Really trying to get out of this frame of thinking because I'm not seeing the full picture. I know they're just projecting what they want me and other people to see. But I know genuinely wishing them well and being happy to see that they got what they wanted hits folks like this on another level. How do I stop feeling bothered?

I am very attached to my parents. This time I've had with them since I moved back home after finishing school has been precious. The other night I thought to myself: ""When am I ever going to have this amount of dedicated time with them ever again? I don't know if I ever will...life moves so fast...""

The only thing that's been helping me has been church and Bible time. I have started going recently and I feel...great every single time I go. I am reminded of the brevity of our lives. Whether a human being lives until 100 or 80 years...that is still short in light of eternity. And while I am aware of this sobering reality (and time with God has changed my perspective on what's truly important). This thought always crosses my mind when I hear news of a rich and famous person dying. They've accumulated everything and couldn't take anything with them.

It's just hard remembering this in the moment when I'm at these social functions. People are mean. They attach their worth to what you have/haven't accomplished. They attach your worth to your career/other external measures of success. I have started to realize that it's an individual's heart and character that carries them far, isn't it? It's really sad how the world doesn't see it that way.

The day after Christmas I have to attend my niece's birthday party. It's a family event so I HAVE to go. Along with extended family are other people (like the ones I have described who will be there). I'm already feeling anxious about this day coming (I'm kind of ashamed to admit it).

Well let me tell you something. I see you. I hear you. You're beautiful inside and out. You're unique and that's amazing! Your flaws, your assets, they all wrap together to make the beautiful person you are! 

You're strong. You're strong because you keep going, you keep pushing, you keep fighting. You're a warrior, a survivor. Waking up and taking it day by day despite how you feel, what you think, or what they say. You get up and push through, that's bravery at it's finest. 

I'm proud of you and love you so much! You're my hero. 

Be proud, be you, be brave, be bold. 

Smile, laugh, love.

You are so much more than their words. More than your insecurities. More than your past.

You're beautiful, worth it, amazing, inspiring. 

You are you.  Own it. Live it. Love it. I know I do.

"Don‚Äôt just do something, sit there",6,risbv3,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/risbv3/dont_just_do_something_sit_there/,0,"So you‚Äôre standing in line at the post office and the queue seems to be completely static. You have a hundred other things you need to do today crammed into your head and you don‚Äôt have time to be stuck like this. You can feel your irritation rising and by the time you get to the front of the queue you might even be snippy with the person serving you.

We have expectations on how life is supposed to work - when we expect life to be fast, convenient and easy and it‚Äôs not we start to become impatient. This isn‚Äôt life‚Äôs fault, its just a fact that not everything happens easily every single time. Our expectations rather than life are the origin of our suffering and this can create stress and contribute to poor health.

So what can we do? The first thing is to train your awareness with some meditation every day so you notice feelings as they arise rather than being swept away. A lot of the time when anxiety and anger come up we‚Äôre barely aware of them influencing our behaviour, Looking deeply, we can see impatience for what it is - a mix of anxiety and anger. When we‚Äôve trained ourselves to notice when impatience is arising we can then ask ourselves what‚Äôs driving it, what are we attached to - is it the other things we feel we need to get done or just simply a driving need to be productive all the time. Noticing impatience is a prompt for us to practice letting go of our need to be productive and our need to get things done. Are those things really important enough to sacrifice your wellbeing over?

When we‚Äôre aware of our impatience and we see the roots of our impatience, we can set an intention to enjoy where we‚Äôre at. When we‚Äôre stuck in traffic, we can enjoy the rhythm of our breath, the feeling of our back on the seat, our hands on the wheel. We can enjoy the feeling of simply being alive. By training ourselves to notice impatience arising it‚Äôs actually a really helpful prompt for us to be present and enjoy what‚Äôs right in front of us.

We can hibernate with love.,12,rgm7mo,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rgm7mo/we_can_hibernate_with_love/,0,"The planet has winter so that she can rest. In some parts of the world, she covers herself in a white blanket for this three month nap. In other places, she releases sheets of rain to wash old seasons away and make space for renewal. In one way or another, most animals spend this season in repose. Predictably, humans have been conditioned to maintain their energy and productivity throughout the winter months, however, we can lovingly offer ourselves elements of hibernation when the days are short and cold.

#### Recognize that retreat is natural

Our bodies want to be warm and dry. They want to be in the sunlight. Thus, it is no wonder that when there are less hours of sun, and less warmth from that sun, our bodies want to slow down and stay still. This process makes sense, and it makes sense to honor it rather than to rebel. It is natural to want to see less people and be awake less when the world around you is sleeping. If you allow yourself to welcome this respite, you can wholeheartedly explore all of the wonderful offerings of slower, colder months. Prepare yourself to welcome winter with love so that the increased time alone and decreased zest for movement don‚Äôt feel like failings. Don‚Äôt ask yourself to maintain the levels of energy that come more naturally in sunnier times.¬†

#### Use the time to reflect

Winter holds within it the start of a new calendar year. The instinct to stay inside offers an opportunity to look inside and reflect on the year that was and the year that is on its way. Without the noise of summer plans and the pressing feeling that you need to enjoy every fall and spring weekend, you can use the retreat of winter to make the months ahead purposeful, personal, and playful. This is a time to read the books on your list and spend extra hours on a recipe. It is a time to love yourself well and strategize how to best love yourself through literal and metaphorical winters to come.¬†

#### Indulge in alone time

As communal beings, the winter can feel lonely. Alas, looked at another way, these are the rare few months of more time alone that can be spent restfully, carefully, and more joyfully solitary. If you let it, extra time alone can feel luxurious, indulgent, and kind. View this time as purposefully restful and restorative. Let yourself doze off under a blanket as the world outside does the same.¬†

#### Nourish yourself¬†

When the sun is shining in the winter, go outside and stand in it. When you crave hearty soup in the winter, go inside and make it. When your skin is begging for moisture, give it the lotion it craves. Winter is a time for nourishment of your body and of yourself. This season makes different demands than the others. Train yourself to listen to those demands so that you don‚Äôt spend the next three months wishing time would unravel more quickly. You can love yourself in winter, and you can love yourself through winter.¬†

I'm lucky in that I live in an apartment with my friends, however, I rarely see them as they are in and out of the house. 

It feels as though everyone around me always has people to see and places to go; my best friend often going out to dinner/making plans, my other roommates busy with their on-campus friends, my boyfriend with his fraternity, friends partying or going to festivals/events. 

turning down plans because I have to study or work on my applications hurts me a lot. i'm currently studying to become a speech-language pathologist, which I am so excited about. but because it matters to me so much, dedicating so much time to it has made me so depressed.

i understand that finding a balance is important, but it has been very difficult for me. i feel so bad when friends ask to hang out, but i typically tell them i'm working late or i have night class and all that. not to mention the anxiety of COVID is still riding pretty high with me. i've had a hard time sleeping recently too. its finals week, but I do not feel relieved simply because the avalanche of all my graduate program deadlines come soon after.

It starts with awareness, applying a sense of interconnection to the things that we consume. Where does our food come from, our clothes, our devices. By taking a moment to understand the connections that our actions have with the wider world we can then inform choices that support a kinder world.  

We can also understand how our current economic and social structures impact our lives. We‚Äôre born into these systems, grow up with them and can be blind to the impact that they have on us and other people but taking a step back gives us an opportunity to see these structures through fresh eyes. When we think of our education system, our workplaces, our justice system, our environment, our social media - do these institutions in the way that they‚Äôre currently structured create a kinder, happier, ethical world for the future. 

The answer may be yes or no but in all cases but there‚Äôs some improvements that can be made. The question for us as individuals is what is our role, how can we engage and drive change that makes our lives less stressful but also protects those who are suffering and marginalised. That might seem huge and overwhelming but we can start with one system - like your school or workplace - and one small thing that you could work with others to make it better.  Try initiating something with others and see how it makes you feel, lots of little changes add up to a kinder world for everyone.

Meanwhile I've been frantic and anxious about studying for my retake exam that I need for my medical residency applications. I've been too focused on this to even care about anything/everything else. I wasn't able to think about the other application materials. Also, I had been searching for months for a clinical externship. So I couldn't get letters of recommendation. Finally got one recently but then found out I had to do my retake exam and take a course for it so I've had to cut down my hours for the externship.

Sometimes, I feel like a failure as a daughter",5,rda47i,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rda47i/how_do_you_stop_feeling_like_a_failure_sometimes/,1,"I'm 28 and a medical school graduate (from the States but went to school abroad). I graduated in 2019, took time out for a few months because I was feeling burnt out. Medical school was really difficult for me. I don't know if i was just overwhelmed or didn't know how to study properly. I failed a lot of exams and even had to repeat a year. I graduated later than all my friends (who are all working doctors and some even married now) I took 7-8 months to do a course to study for my first licensing exam (in order to land a medical residency - a training program for doctors at a hospital). I had to repeat this course twice and ended up with a bare pass on my first board exam. When my dad found out, he had a meltdown and didn't talk to me (or my mom) for days. Both of my parents have been supportive all these years I felt so terrible for letting them down. My mom was still happy because I passed.

I got derailed with my second exam because I was heartbroken over a guy (I know, terrible excuse). It was a potential relationship that didn't work out and I was left feeling devastated for months. Along with burn out didn't help either. I did self-study for 5 months, took my exam on October 1st (Couldn't sleep the night before) and ended up failing by 12 points. My mom and I didn't end up telling my dad the truth because of his reaction the last time. So we had to lie and say that I passed but with a lower score than I had hoped. My mom was still supportive of me (although disappointed) and got a tutor for me who has been very helpful. So I'm studying for that along with another smaller test (it's a weird english test I have to do that's needed to apply for medical residency. It's scheduled for next week). My dad doesn't know I'm studying for my retake so this morning he asked me when I'm going to take my english test - so i had to lie to him and tell him end of January. He started freaking out and he was like: ""Well when are you going to get interviews for residency then!? You should have thought about this before."" So I had to make up an excuse that end of January was the only date I could get for this test. He remained quiet and just left the house. (just to note: My dad is a doctor - he came from an Asian country and performed extremely well in his courses and exams. He passed everything with flying colors.) He has also been helping out his cousin's daughter (who has supposedly applied for 200 + programs to another specialty and already getting interviews. I feel like he's probably comparing me to her.)

With medical residencies, they do only higher once a year (you find out in March), but there are many off-cycle positions throughout the year and I reminded him that there will be many spots available even after March. He was still mad at me and said, ""Well, you're supposed to maximize your chances!"". I didn't say anything. Worst case scenario I will have to wait another year, but, I'm going to do everything I can to get a residency position before July. I'm gonna prove it to myself and my parents. It's possible. People do it all the time. I do feel terrible because overall, they have been so supportive of me - emotionally, and they have paid for my education. They've given me everything. I feel terrible that they've had to wait for me so long to get my act together. I want to be a doctor more anything - specifically, a child psychiatrist (and there is SOOOOO much else I want to do with my life). This is now how I envisioned would go post-graduation. I still didn't think I'd be struggling academically in my late 20s, but I am. I'm sure they expected more from me now. I feel like I've failed",1639147286.0

"Do you believe in manifestation and if you do, can you really manifest your hopes/dreams/fantasies?",1,rcrab6,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/rcrab6/do_you_believe_in_manifestation_and_if_you_do_can/,2,"A part of me feels hopeful and optimistic, but another part is a bit afraid to dream because my biggest hope/fantasy is very unrealistic. Hear me out:

I'm 28 years old and on the verge of self-discovery. At the moment I am swamped with studying but am realizing all the things I want to do in life (even outside of my career - like passion projects/hobbies/the little things that make me happy). For example, I want to do a lot with flower design (such as learning how to make flower crowns, garlands, bouquets) and write (and even publish) a book, volunteer (and I am in the process of setting that up right now. I'll be tutoring children once a week. Meeting with the center director this weekend). I've lost 30 lbs this year. I am trying really hard to work on myself, cultivate self-love, and nurture my self-esteem.

There are days when I struggle with being chronically single (because I've never been in a relationship/been noticed by men/had men attracted to me even though I've wanted to be in a relationship since I was at least 10 years old, maybe even younger. I struggled with never being ""chosen"".

There were a lot of other circumstances....growing up in a conservative household where dating was not allowed, being immersed in the field of medicine (medical school consumed my time for a good number of years - I struggled so much academically. In medical school, I failed a lot of exams and repeated a year, so I ended up graduating later than all my friends.

I'm still struggling even after graduating with studying for my licensing board exams and trying to land a medical residency so I can work as a practicing doctor. I recently failed one of my licensing exams and am studying again to retake it (I've got a tutor who has been very helpful) so it's taking me quite a long time. My dream is to be a child psychiatrist. I won't stop until I get there though.

I've also been bullied by guys I've had crushes on - this affected my self-esteem greatly. I felt unloved for the longest time.

Along with working on myself, one way I try and cope is by indulging in my romantic fantasies (I don't know how healthy that is tbh). I read a lot of fanfiction. And I've created a narrative in my head based off of this one story I've been reading (I know this is really embarrassing please don't judge! I'm being as open and vulnerable as possible). I love mythology, particularly, the story of Hades and Persephone (it's a modern twist based on the original tale). Persephone is my favorite goddess. The goddess of springtime! I feel like I am able to identify with her (very attached/pampered by her mother, protected in her mother's realm).

So the main character in the story was Persephone in her past life. In the modern day era, she is studying to be a doctor because she wants to save/preserve lives. One day, Hades - the Underworld king - catches a glimpse of her and watches her for a while, desiring to make her the Queen of his realm. He'll do anything to have her - he is drawn to a ""light"" and a ""purity"" he sees in her that he can't just quite describe.

I have that same story playing in my head. That I'm the girl who is studying really hard for her exams in order to be a practicing doctor. At some point, a handsome god catches a glimpse of me at a spring festival (while I'm with my friends) and wants to bring me to his realm, fill his palace (and heart) with life and light. He'd show me and let me explore different parts of the Underworld (even outside his palace - places such as the Elysian fields, other magnificent lands and the creatures in it, etc.)

Even though I have never been in a relationship or been looked at by a man...one of my greatest desires is to be married. It is a vocation I hope (and always pray) someday I am called to.

I've always imagined in my married life living in a beautiful, majestic, and grand home with my husband in an idyllic setting. Surrounding the home are courtyards and vast gardens. He would encourage me to wear lovely silk gowns, decorate our home however I choose, and say things like, ""I have all these flowers for you in these gardens so that you may make as many flower crowns, garlands, and bouquets to your heart's content!"". He'd be very generous and always show me how much he values and cherishes me (as I would want to do the same for him and pamper him). I've also always wanted either a horse or alpaca farm.

So yes, there's this beautiful fairytale-esque dream...I'm wondering what the real life equivalent would look like. If there is one (hopefully).

I know it sounds really corny (and again, embarrassing). Coping with these feelings is very hard. Somehow someway...idk how....I hope my fantasy comes true. As I'm working on myself and other goals, I do pray A LOT about this. I wonder if God hears me. Even though I've never been chosen but if I have to wait a bit longer...it would be worth it.",1639084027.0

How do you choose yourself when no one is choosing you? Would love to read your answers and your own personal experiences.

What tips/advice would you be able to provide to help me cope? At the moment I can't afford therapy but I would like to get it at some stage.

I am chronically single and that's why I'm asking this question (I am someone who has never had any experience romantically).

There are days when I feel down and I'm wondering how you all cope. Not only am I experiencing sadness and grief, but, anger and frustration as well. To be honest, one way (and I will get into this later if you continue to read) is by indulging in romantic fantasies. To highlight these feelings (of rejection) I'll give you a little more background about me, I've also included some personal anecdotes. Apologies for the length (you may skip the stories if you like).

I struggle with rejection (romantically) because it's all I've experienced. I'm 28 and have never been in a relationship/had men notice me/pursue me. I know that male attention is not valuable or important. It's still really hard especially when you're someone like me who has never even been looked at. I would imagine that most of you have been in relationships for X amount of years regardless of how things ended. Someone still wanted to be with you in the first place. You were ""picked"". You were ""chosen"". I know, you are all probably rolling your eyes thinking that I'm just a ""pick-me"". I'm telling you though, you really have no idea what it's like to be chronically single and in a place of longing. You can't possibly fathom that pain. I resent that my friends (who have been in their fair share of relationships) constantly tell me that I'm lucky that I was never approached because men just use you and men are assholes. They always tell me that I have been spared. Again, they have no idea where I'm coming from. Someone still wanted them in the first place. I understand that relationships (objectively) complicate a woman's life no matter what because you are factoring in another human being into the equation - and lots of difficulties do come with that. But still, it hurts. Even if these women were broken up with - someone still wanted to be with them. Someone still chose them initially. This is the point I'm trying to make. But I am afraid this kind of thinking will get me in trouble one day. My friend from childhood is afraid (and always had a feeling) that if I don't stop thinking like this I will get myself involved in a really toxic/abusive relationship. I've never been asked to a dance. I've never had a Valentine either (probably won't have one in 2022 either and I'm okay with that. I will spend it with my family as usual).

There have always been guys I've been interested in - but they were complete assholes. They bullied me. And yet I would feel really envious/upset that they chose other girls and not me. I would feel jealous of their ex-girlfriends/girlfriends. I know it's terrible. In high school, all the boys made fun of me and my crush stopped talking to me (and dated some other girl). Another guy and his group of male friends bullied me severely and made rude remarks, and spread rumors about me in medical school). There was another guy I crushed on for 4 years - I maintained a ""friendship"" with him - but he was aware that I crushing on him the whole time. I hung around him and he even asked me to lunch a couple times, put his arms around my waist but he would always pursue other girls. It got to the point where I could no longer be in the friendship because it was hard to be around him/talk to him on the phone. I was in agony. So I ended up confessing to him my feelings and I was rejected. I asked him for space and he never talked to me again. He also stopped talking to and ignored all my friends.

Then earlier this year - and I think this is why I'm struggling with anger - I was introduced to a guy (for a courtship with the end goal as marriage, we met through family friends) and we hit it off when we met. Although I will say that my dad was not happy about it. My dad felt something was not right. He didn't like the guy when my family met him and kept making faces while he was over at our house. (he thinks the family is more cheap instead of extremely frugal). So this guy wanted my number (it was the first time this happened). He initiated the texts (and I was in awe this was happening because no guy ever had wanted to get to know me before). Things were fine but then he started telling me things like he's robotic and has absolutely no friends (he's in his early 30s) - but only close to his parents and cousin (who is like his older sister). He began grilling me right away about how many kids I wanted, what my ideal family situation looked like, and he wanted to identify areas of conflict in a relationship. I went along with it because I didn't know any better. He asked me if I wanted nannies for children and if the kids should have medications/psychiatrists. I mentioned that having nannies would be great because I grew up with one (she looked after me and my siblings well). He said he would want his parents to watch the kids (as they have done for his cousin's children). I mentioned that I'd want to work part-time. He asked, ""What about all that school and exams?"" I explained that my mom worked part-time so she could work around our schedules (me and my siblings, growing up). He said fine but did mention that its important for both partners to work. He said he would work from home because he does not subscribe to traditional gender roles.

He enjoyed outdoor activities like hiking and biking (esp. mountain biking) and going to remote locations in other parts of the world to hike there and meet the local population (and I thought this was cool and something I would have loved to have done with him) - but he also kept going on about barebones vacations (which I've never done) and kept emphasizing bargain hunting (he told me I could buy a table for $1000 instead of $20,000 - but I never named any prices - I just told him how lovely it would be to spend some money on decorative items for our home. I've always envisioned a beautiful house once I'm married. There's nothing wrong with wanting nice things, right? I even told him what if wanted to buy a lovely dress (I would need a nice wardrobe for work anyway) to get dolled up for myself and for him too (I think there's nothing wrong with wanting to look nice for your spouse also). But when I said that, he said he has experience with people who do things for appearances sake and he wholeheartedly disagrees with this way of life.

I mentioned that going out to eat once a week (and treating myself off and on with a nice gift, etc.) is something I've always done. That just because I grew up comfortable does not mean that I'm an impulsive buyer/spender. I lived on my own for a few years (while in medical school) and know how to mind and budget money. That family instilled a great respect for money in me. Treating myself is something that I am used to and that I have a right to do. But he said that if he is contributing to the children's college fund while I'm going out to restaurants once a week, there is an imbalance. This was bizarre because I don't think going out for a nice meal once a week would affect the hypothetical children's college fund? He framed it as if it were an ""either-or"" situation. But I pointed out that it doesn't have to be. Why not do both? I did mentioned that going out and treating yourself is healthy. It's something else we could do to spend time together and connect along with hiking/biking/anything else he wanted to do. I did also mentioned that I go out with my parents often and am pampered by them - I didn't mean ""pampered"" in a waiting on me hand and foot kind of way, but spending quality with him, saying and doing thoughtful/loving things. Things were fine up until then and he said he would get back to me (we were texting back and forth everyday) but then I didn't hear from him for 4-5 days which made me upset. When he came back, he reiterated all the points in the previous paragraph and said he was concerned about my expectations of being pampered by a future partner. (I had even made my wants smaller and suggested going out twice a month if that would work. He wasn't receptive to that.)

So when I replied, I reiterated all my points adding to the fact that this money thing seemed like something was unwilling to compromise on, like it was a non-negotiable. I asked him to help me understand him and to give me the same grace, that could find an option that worked for us both. I told him that I really liked him and how willing/open I was to make this work (I really was trying).

He did mentioned that while he was growing up, his family was hand to mouth and he never wanted to be hungry for money ever again. But he ended up doing well for himself. He makes 200K+ per year and owns 3 homes (he works at the intersection of IT/finances). I didn't understand why me wanting to spend my money was a big deal - I even suggested a ""mine, yours, and ours"" financial arrangement. It's perfectly normal to want to treat yourself or go for a hard-earned vacation, etc. right? I mentioned that he appeared to have an unhealthy relationship with money, which I found unsettling. I also pointed out that he didn't tell me what happened in his last relationship (ended over a year ago and lasted 2 years). He briefly glossed over it and didn't tell me what happened. So I said we could always talk about it later if/when he felt comfortable talking about it. I even gave him a way out and asked if getting to know each other was what he really wanted?

He replied immediately and said he believed my concerns should not be minimized and promised no more excuses and said it was clear that I deserved attention, respect, and respect with the level of communication. He said he felt very lucky to have met me. That I'm genuine and amazing. Possess strength of character, integrity to stand up for my beliefs, and the ability to be myself (which is what he was looking for in a partner). He said that he did not wish to cloud my unsettled feelings with sweet nothings. He said he really does enjoy talking with me and hoped I felt the same about him.

I told him I did. That I did feel the same way. And I really meant every word. So I just reiterated my previous points about the concerns I had (about his views about money and the previous relationship) and said I was eager to keep getting to know him. I also asked him what made him want to pursue marriage/a relationship at this point in time. I asked him to be upfront/honest with me about everything (as I have been with him) rather than me thinking he's hiding something. I said I really wanted to keep getting to know him.

I didn't hear from him again for 3 days.

Then when he came back, he ended it with me and I was left feeling devastated. Like something was dangled and then taken away from me. I was so fond of him. Very fond of him. There was so much more I wanted to know about him and now I will never get the chance to. I found out later (a few months later) that his mom was basically shopping him around and looking for other prospects for him which made me upset and feel bad. My parents keep telling me I didn't miss out on much and I shouldn't need trouble convincing myself. It sucks though. I knew we were basically incompatible (with our lifestyles), but, I wasn't asking for much at all. I wanted to demonstrate to him that I absolutely could be a loving, respectful, communicative, and gracefully-allowing partner. It really hurt. Around the time when he broke it off with me, his dad was diagnosed with cancer. (He was taking good care of his dad those few months he had left). Then his dad passed away 3 months ago. I felt sad to hear that.

A couple weeks ago, my parents went over to his house to pay their respects (his mom, older brother, and older brother's fiancee were there also). He and his older brother do not get along at all. My parents noticed that. His older brother owns a home in another city and goes out to eat at nice places and travels a lot.

So apparently (the guy I was talking to) he saw my parents and didn't even want to talk to them. He ended up leaving the house. I felt so bad when I heard that. When my mom came home she said, ""Yeah...he cut you off cold turkey. I don't think he was as nice as he presented himself to be.""

Still, I felt bad when I heard that.

But she told me to work as hard as I can on my exams, get residency, live my amazing life and shine bright. He didn't deserve me, she says.

Now there's obviously nothing wrong with living in a small house. My mom said their home was like a relic - it's 50 years old. And his dad who passed away, he was the manager of the IRS (so he was doing well for himself financially). I think unfortunately, it was more selfish penny-pinching/being cheap that he subjected his family to instead of not actually having the means. His mom worked (and still does) also.

Despite the obvious discrepancies, I feel sad. I really wanted to see him again.

So as you have read, it's been nothing but awful and disappointing experiences. That took a toll on me and my self-esteem was severely impacted.

I grew up rather sheltered. My parents forbid me from dating, drinking, etc. I never did any of that stuff to please them and be a ""good daughter"". I have also been deeply immersed in my studies (I went to medical school and struggled during my time there - failing many exams, repeating a year. It was very difficult. Graduated a year later than my friends). And I've been struggling to study for my licensing exams (before applying for medical residency - my end goal is to become a child psychiatrist). I'm re-taking one of the licensing exams (with a tutor). The whole process has been stressful, but, having extra help has been great. My tutor says I'm improving my test taking skills and knowledge base which is reassuring. I know it's taking me longer than most people, sometimes I do feel a bit insecure about it. Like I'd feel inadequate compared to the daughters of people my parents know who are well-established doctors, lawyers, aspiring politicians and business magnates, academics, etc. (who are all working for prestigious places), married to people in those respective professions and a couple on their way to having kids. But I remind myself that the true goal in life is inner peace/contentment/joy/happiness/personal fulfillment/satisfaction. My worth is not determined by external measures of success.

But I am on the verge of discovering myself - I am realizing what my true values are in life and what kinds of hobbies I want to pursue (for example - floral design and I've contacted a few flower farms to help out at the farm in exchange for their time to help me learn how to make flower crowns, garlands, bouquets, etc.). I've been working on my fitness (I've lost 30 lbs), working on my relationship with God (and nourishing my friendships and relationships with my family). While I'm studying, I've also been trying to (once a week) volunteer/get a part time job. No one is taking (well most places are not) because of COVID but I did hear back from a tutoring company called Kumon to tutor children from K-12 (in reading/math). I'm meeting with the center director this Saturday, which I'm excited about. I've always wanted an opportunity to work with kids.

I also want to write (and publish) a book (I've been in contact with an author who is happy to review my work and give me constructive feedback). I really am trying my best to work on myself. I can't afford therapy right now but I want to get it at some point. At the moment, I'm sticking to enjoying the small things in life (that bring me joy - like time with loved ones, thinking about potential hobbies, fitness, etc.), journaling, Bible time, etc.

But there are days when I really struggle with these thoughts and the feelings of rejection/being unwanted/overlooked/etc. I am struggling with anger. So what are some better ways I can cope? I am so sorry for the very long post. Not feeling great today.

Along with working on myself...another way I try and cope is by indulging in my romantic fantasies. I read a lot of fanfiction. And I've created a narrative in my head based off of this one story I've been reading (I know this is really embarrassing please don't judge! I'm being as open and vulnerable as possible). I love mythology, particularly, the tale of Hades and Persephone (it's a modern twist based on the original tale). Persephone is my favorite goddess. So the main character was Persephone in her past life. In the modern day era, she is studying to be a doctor because she wants to save/preserve lives. One day, Hades - the Underworld king - catches a glimpse of her and watches her for a while, desiring to make her the Queen of his realm.

I have that same story playing in my head. That I'm the girl who is studying really hard for her exams in order to be a practicing doctor. At some point, a handsome god catches a glimpse of me at a spring festival (while I'm with my friends) and wants to bring me to his realm, fill his palace (and heart) with life and light.

I've always imagined in my married life living in a beautiful, majestic, and grand home with my husband in an idyllic setting. Surrounding the home are courtyards and vast gardens. He would encourage me to wear lovely silk gowns, decorate our home however I choose, and say things like, ""I have all these flowers for you in these gardens so that you may make as many flower crowns, garlands, and bouquets to your heart's content!"". He'd be very generous and always show me how much he values and cherishes me (as I would want to do the same for him and pamper him).

I know it sounds really corny (and again, embarrassing). Coping with these feelings is very hard. Somehow someway...idk how....I'd hope my fantasy comes true. Even though I've never been chosen but if I have to wait a bit longer...it would be worth it.

Please impart me with your wisdom. Again, I'm sorry for the long post. It's been very discouraging and frustrating",1639005965.0

Been thinking about suicide every day for a while but have managed to divert that thinking, but yesterday it became very real. I realized fully that the only thing really stopping me from going further with it is imagining what it would do to my parents, my friends, and my recent ex (she's had to deal with friends self-serving since childhood, I know she still cares about me and I know she would blame herself), rather than being because I want to live.

After sitting with these thoughts for longer than I have recently in the shower, I got out and kind of on a whim told my mom (staying with parents for a month) I needed to talk to her. We sat down and I didn't even know what to say, but I eventually got there, but it was hard because I didn't want to burden her with that again, I've had suicidal ideation in the past but never quite this serious.

Parents were very supportive, I managed to see a doctor yesterday and I'm starting a medication she said may help. I booked an appointment with a counsellor, and I talked to my profs (in a very small program) and they are letting me take my time with final projects and I've decided to withdraw from next semester to take a break, work, and get myself on solid ground with less pressure.

Been struggling for a long time with self love, but my recent ex helped me see a different angle on myself while we were together, one that I hope to see again with my own eyes this time. She saw me as an amazing guy, one she felt she was super lucky to get to date, and she maintained when she broke it off that I'm a fantastic guy. Hopefully soon I'll see for myself what she saw in me. I have realized I relied too much on her support through my anxiety, and I started to heal and grow with her, but losing her has knocked me very off-balance and unstable, now I've gotta stand on my own 2 feet. I've got a long way still to go but at least I've taken that first step, now I just gotta keep putting one foot in front of the other. Sorry for the long post but I'm a little proud of finally seeking help for real.

Stop living the life other people want for you - you‚Äôll never satisfy them,1,r8sq30,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/r8sq30/stop_living_the_life_other_people_want_for_you/,0,"I stumbled across a video recently of a nurse who spent her career giving palliative care to people at the end of their lives - she wrote a book about the most common regrets that people have on their deathbed. Top of the list is that they wished they‚Äôd lived their lives as their true selves, not the person that they thought other people wanted them to be. We‚Äôve all felt that way sometimes - that we‚Äôre putting on a mask in order to fit in, we‚Äôre not following our own path.  Its important to take a step back and understand why this happens.

Human beings are social animals - we do what we can to get by and to survive we need to be a part of a wider society. Other folks have expectations about how things should be and how people should act. We grew with those people in our families, at school, we see them in our workplace.  We are those people too - we have our own values and beliefs that put pressure on other folks to behave in a certain way. Most of these are fairly benign and encourage ethical behaviour but we can be influenced by this pressure by degrees over a long period of time to the point where we feel we‚Äôre living someone else‚Äôs life. You can look in the mirror and ask yourself, how did I get here?

The answer is that our fear of being judged shifts us a little bit every day and its critical on who you choose to spend your time with. You want to surround yourself with people who are kind, and who will listen when you need to share something without judgement. Its is entirely reasonable for you to take a step back from harmful relationships where you are judged harshly for simply being who you are.

Where does their judgement come from and how can we prevent it from pushing us in a particular direction? When we are being unfairly judged by someone else, we naturally feel anxious and our perspective on the world narrows until all of our attention is spend on things we‚Äôve done in the past. Its reasonable of course for people to feed back - we want to get feedback from other people - but when this is hypercritical and delivered in an unkind way that's not OK. This is what starts shifting who we are into something else, what the other person wants us to be.

Its important to stop, breathe, take a step back and see what's really going on. When people judge others harshly, it tends to come from their own fears and insecurities, brought about by damaging experiences in their past and traumas shared across generations. You can look at that person who‚Äôs judging you, see their suffering and wish them happiness and pace. 

Initially that may be very difficult to do - you may feel a great deal of anger towards them. But developing understanding for the circumstances that led them to judge harshly and feeling compassion for their suffering is the only way to let go of your own fear and resentments and start to feel comfortable in your own skin.

General Rule #78:  Inmates may carry one piece of fruit out of the chow hall to consume at a later time. They may only have one piece of fruit in their possession at any time.  Guys here often go right from lunch to their afternoon classes, so it was not unusual for me to see apples or bananas on a table.

I‚Äôd like to give you a little history first: Marion Correctional in Ohio has a nonprofit called Healing Broken Circles, which offers a staggering amount of programming in almost every conceivable area. Fortunately, they held a class, I helped facilitate teaching JAVA. 
On this one particular day, I entered a classroom and passed two students sitting at a table and something strange caught my eye. ‚ÄúIs there JAVA on that banana?‚Äù I know just enough about computer languages to know what I saw. 

Byte bites = 5;  
For (bites>0, bites - - ){ 
Mouth.chomp(banana); 

Louis the banana‚Äôs owner and author, spun the banana, revealing many lines of code. 
We teach programming, so it is not that odd to see lines of code strewn about. If you knew Louis, it wasn‚Äôt strange to see some written on that yellow skin. All I needed were two words and the questioning look on my face did the rest. ‚ÄúWhat the...‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúI coded a process for peeling my banana and how to upload it.‚Äù Nerds may find this next line funny, Louis smirked like a Cheshire cat when he delivered, ‚ÄúThey already code on Raspberry pies, why not a banana?‚Äù I simply had to have this code. The above picture is what he wrote. I shared with him that if some day, an android is taught to be more human, and do things like eat a banana, his code will be what did it. As much as a super-brainy JAVA nerd is able to express emotion, I think he might have beamed with a little pride. Fast forward to Covid. The state had better things to worry about and the Healing Broken Circles contract was not renewed. There is now a void in here for that type of intellectual pursuit.

It‚Äôs only when I had the awareness of how unworthy I felt and how much I didn‚Äôt loved myself and wasn‚Äôt my back (only in the subconscious mind as I didn‚Äôt knew it I thought I did love myself and I had other shit to take care of)

Long long story short
This is what u should do:

1. Start rewire your brain say (AND FEEL) that u pleased with yourself you like yourself (start small) 
2. Always say (AND FEEL) that you‚Äôre Big Important Significant (not better than though but your are big important and significant)
3. You‚Äôre worthy being beautiful happy

All of those looks like affirmations only but u start vibrate on those vibration for start. 
Try to hold those vibes like every frickin min and when u go down check up on your awareness and go back to steps 1-2-3

Then 

1. When something triggers love and feel it and change the story (it‚Äôs hard on start but goes on really well after a while) 
2. Start rewrite your brain on any situation even when talking to people smile to yourself being yourself up like you will do for your best friend be your cheerleader and keep holding the vibration of the feeling of the words I stated above

Remember you‚Äôre worthy and big and amazing person

Be aware of your stress habits and take the time to look deeply into the roots of your anxiety to free yourself from stress,6,r3e5gt,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/r3e5gt/be_aware_of_your_stress_habits_and_take_the_time/,1,"Stress has a huge impact on our lives. Headaches, low mood, insomnia, tension, high blood pressure - three quarters of us feel overwhelmed or unable to cope in any given year and that feeds into our whole lives, particularly our interactions with other people. We‚Äôve all had times where we‚Äôve said things we regret or used a snippy tone because we‚Äôre been under pressure. So it‚Äôs really important for us to train ourselves to deal with stress when things are going well, be aware of when our stress levels are rising and then tend to it with compassion.

A key risk when we get stressed out is that out good practices go out the window and our bad habits come screeching back into the picture. We stop doing the wholesome hobbies that keep us in the present moment like exercise, spending time with other people and creative activities. If life is stressful then consciously schedule time for these things, while restraining the things we like to do when stressed like snacking, watching TV, drinking, social media. These harmful forms of consumption can be habit forming and put us on the path of suffering so notice when you‚Äôre doing them and make a conscious choice about how much you consume rather than being on autopilot.

But its also critical for us to train ourselves to turn and face our stress, smile to our stress, look deeply into our stress. Most of the time we don‚Äôt ask ourselves the basic question ‚Äúwhy am I feeling stressed?‚Äù We‚Äôre barely conscious of it because we throw ourselves into consumption and 'doing'. We need to stop, breath and reflect.

Rather than shutting the door we need to welcome our stress in, even if that's the last thing we feel like doing, and take some time to understand the circumstances driving it, what our reaction is, where this links to in our past and crucially what our attachment is that causes us to suffer. For example: if you feel stressed because of your performance at work you can meditate on what it that drives this - it could be the relationship with your boss. You can look at relationships in the past where you felt unfairly judged. You can understand that your attachment to other people‚Äôs perceptions of you is where the stress comes from. And through understanding that golden thread you can start to let go of your anxiety.

This might sound overwhelming, especially if you have lots of things stressing you out, but its possible to liberate yourself from suffering when you take each part and really understand it while feeling compassion for yourself. You are a good person and you deserve to be happy. You just need to be kind to yourself and spend some time seeing the world as it really is. When we‚Äôre stressed out our perspective gets narrower and narrower - that's how we end up hurting other people unintentionally. When we apply the spotlight of awareness to it we broaden it out again and become our true calm happy compassionate selves.

It‚Äôs very hard to describe, I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about other people. Even when I‚Äôm doing things for myself like meditation or journaling, exercise. It‚Äôs always in my head, thinking about whatever guy I like or what I want to talk about with my friends. Its kind of like a movie scene, I see myself in third person. It‚Äôs really bad with the guy thing, but it‚Äôs normal imo because I am a teenager and hormones. Even beyond my spiritual habits I think about them when I‚Äôm driving, working, doing anything. I daydream about weird scenarios for hours (a lot of times they come true, LOA visualization and all, but the problem is I can‚Äôt let go of the desire and focus on my vibrations) while I do things. As a child I was taught that thinking about yourself or putting yourself first is selfish, which allowed me to let people use me as a doormat, and I have some weird need to follow these weird incorrect rules my parents taught me even in my own head. I know now that self love is not selfish but it‚Äôs hard to actually put it into practice.It‚Äôs not really interfering with school or my productivity, but it‚Äôs just annoying. They‚Äôre not even people I see everyday! 

My self esteem is bad right now, and I‚Äôm working on my mindset. I want to focus on myself but I‚Äôm really struggling to get these people out of my head. I have anxiety (medicated but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help with the thoughts) so I think that plays a part. How can I genuinely focus on myself? My plan is to use my phone less, meditate and journal more. But I only want to think about me right now, even if that sounds selfish. That would really help me with my self esteem, self love, and just being in tune with myself in general. I know I‚Äôm in control, but I really need some advice about this.

It‚Äôs my first time posting on reddit and I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub. Before I explain anything I am aware that this problem comes within me and not my partner (21), I also know the best thing I could do is go to therapy (which I will, just trying to find a good one).

So, I‚Äôm a very insecure person, I used to be very confident but at some point all of that changed and now I just see myself as someone very replaceable. My partner is a very loving person and they always reassure me when I doubt myself, but I know it can be draining for them (and me) to have me always asking them if they love me or if they are sure they are happy with me. 

For some reason every time they tell me they love me, my brain tells me they are lying, I will look for anything that might be wrong or that gives me the slightest reason to get worried, needless to say I never find anything, my partner loves me very much and they would never even consider looking at someone else in a romantic way. It makes me sick acting this way and not being able to trust them since they‚Äôve never done anything to break my trust.

I really don‚Äôt understand why this is happening as they are very caring and they express their affection and love to me all the time and I know very well they would never do anything to harm me. Can anyone give me any advice as to what I could do to stop thinking like this and just be able to enjoy the time with my partner instead of thinking that something‚Äôs wrong?

We can gather with love,2,qz16fj,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qz16fj/we_can_gather_with_love/,0,"The months with less sunlight are also the months we are brought into more gatherings. We gather for holidays, holiday spin-offs, and celebrations. We gather at will, and, at times, we gather because of the pressure to do so. While it can be a time of joy and togetherness, this season also asks a lot of us. By preparing yourself and finding ways to gently introduce humor, joy, and honesty, this can be a time of gathering with love. 

**Prepare with love**

Each gathering requires some preparation. If you are meeting a group for the first time, you might prepare by learning their roles and rituals. Remind yourself that it is exciting to meet you, and they are fortunate to have you in their company. Prepare by thinking of prompts to keep conversation from going stale. This can be especially challenging after nearly two years of pandemics-style socializing, which had most of us in the company of those we know well. Approach the strangers around you with curiosity, and prepare yourself to be present. 

If you are gathering with family, you can prepare by reminding yourself how seeing your family tends to impact you. Maybe you are expected to step back into a role that you have purposefully outgrown. You might feel pressured to avoid topics of conversation or to keep important parts of your identity out of the eyes and minds of those sitting at the table with you. You know your family‚Äôs patterns, thus, preparing yourself for the things you are and are not allowed to be is a challenging act of self love. Gathering can be a days-long saga of joy, triggers, comfort, and chaos. Prepare yourself for an imperfect time together. Create a toolbox of boundaries and ways to keep yourself grounded. Write notes in your phone with reminders and kind words to yourself.  

**Be gentle with yourself**

When gatherings challenge you, be gentle with yourself. Take long showers and short walks. If you happen to over-share or make a poorly timed joke, just remember that you are likely much more fixated on small missteps than others are. Remind yourself of your interactions‚Äô successes. When things don‚Äôt go as planned, remember that plans are often made to be changed. Laugh at yourself and your surroundings. Not everything needs to be ruminated on to be resolved. 

**Be gentle with those around you**

If you are finding a gathering to be challenging, it is likely that those you are with are feeling the same. Humans are wired to be in community, alas, being in community is often fraught. Give those you are with grace when they deserve it, and excuse yourself when that grace is not warranted. We are conditioned to see this time of year through rose colored glasses, but when rose turns to grey, be forgiving and curious and generous to the extent that you can. When possible, bring in levity.  

**Keep parts of your routine that serve you**

Part of loving yourself through this season requires diligently sticking to parts of your routine. You might not be able to fully execute your usual daily practices, but, as much as you can, keep elements of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at an arm's reach. This might require waking up a bit earlier, or stepping away from the 105th board game to do a quick workout. You might need to journal on your phone during a car ride instead of sitting down at your desk to write. Tweaks will be important, as will flexibility and forgiveness when you don‚Äôt quite get everything you want done. That‚Äôs okay. You are okay. Infact, you are much, much more than okay. 

**Take the time to yourself that you need**

An important element of togetherness is being alone. Take the time you need to implement your routine, soothe yourself, and get grounded. You don‚Äôt owe anyone. In a season that places multiple pressures on your time, this is an important reminder. You can take naps. You can close doors. You can go to the bathroom just to stand there and take a few deep breaths. You are sharing so much of yourself right now, and it is important to remember to keep some of that just for you. It will benefit everyone around you as well.

Iv been through abuse, health scares, losing friends, and heartbreak. I have tried many times to love myself but havnt been able to. I would start my journey and then give up. I have always let my worth be defined by others and let others treat me bad. But after the year iv had I think its time.

Here's a little back story on my year. I was diagnosed with cancer on October 14. That was officially the day my life completely changed. I lost all my friends when I found out. I had to shave my head before chemo because I refused to let chemo take it. Because of where I lived and no family there I let my son go live with my dad so I could focus on my health. That and toddlers are just oversized germs and qe didn't want me getting sick at all ü§£. So the whole 12 rounds of chemo it was my ex and I. The whole time iv had someone always telling me that I didn't have a reason to be sad. I didn't have a reason to be depressed. I didn't have a reason to be sad. That I had everything in the world and my feelings honestly didn't matter. I had no positivity. Nothing. Only people who lived me up was my family. 

After 12 rounds my pet showed a spot left and my ex left me. Told me he didn't wanna deal with cancer anymore. Well turns out that I have a massive blood clot in my pelvis and I was cancer free. Cancer didn't kill me physicly but it killed who I was. I have been struggling since getting the news in september. The depression has been horrible. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again because Facebook memories is showing posts from my journey. 

My journey unfortunately hasn't stopped because of the aftermath it took on my mental health and physical health. But I woke up today and realized that I'm relearning who I am. That it's time to take charge of my life and build myself back up. To heal and to finally love myself. To heal my heart from the devastating heart break. To make friends who will lift me up and be positive instead of tearing me down to make themselves better. 

So here I am. Sharing the start of my story and to ask for help on how to start. I have no idea how to start or things to do so any advice and ideas would help!!!",1637448126.0

In this way you will not repeat those same mistakes and can genuinely let go of of your shame, guilt, anger and negativity of the past and become a better human being.

I want to be clear that this is not about *justifying* our past mistakes and wrongdoings; it's about having genuine remorse and changing for the better, which enables us to let go of our guilt and move forward (which is a healthy way to deal with our past mistakes).

We can interrupt overthinking with love.,8,qxo2co,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qxo2co/we_can_interrupt_overthinking_with_love/,0,"Overthinking has the perplexing ability to be simultaneously terrifying and soothing. Ruminating allows us to feel both powerful and foolish. It can feel like an out of control method for finding some semblance of control. Alas, when you take the time to lovingly interrupt overthinking, you allow yourself to live in the present without a mind clouded by thoughts of what could have been or what might be coming.¬†

#### Address why overthinking entices you

Overthinking allows you to win arguments, impress people in suites, confront authority, and enjoy a gathering - all before these events take place. When you mentally fast forward, pause, and replay parts of your life, you have more agency than when you are operating in, and interacting with, the chaotic world around you. However, the process of experiencing life in your thoughts pales in comparison to allowing yourself to be present.¬†

Often, we overthink to feel in control. There is comfort in having everything go your way, or preparing yourself for the worst-case scenario. It is no question why overthinking makes such a comfortable home inside of our heads, however, identifying why and when you overthink has the benefit of allowing you to be more lovingly grounded in what goes on around you.¬†

#### Interrupt the cyclical trap

Once your thoughts choose a genre for the day, it can be tough to reroute your mind. It requires loving interruption to remind yourself that all of the stories your brain is telling you aren‚Äôt true. In order to have clean drinking water, you need a filter to catch the gunk. Your mind needs a similar filter to ensure your hours and days are not spent letting the gunk circulate through that beautiful brain of yours. Find what works for you to catch yourself before the thoughts do.¬†

#### Create mindful rituals

A loving way to interrupt the spiral of overthinking is to create mindful rituals. Perhaps when a rabbit hole presents itself on your path, you count your fingers and toes or turn on a song or notice 5 interesting things in your surroundings. The rituals you create will depend on what works for you, and your ability to stay present depends on finding them.¬†

#### Ask yourself questions

Efforts to meaningfully address patterns of overthinking can be strengthened by an approach of curiosity. If you consistently find yourself ruminating over what you say in the presence of certain company, maybe look into why their presence causes you to feel self-conscious about how you express yourself. If you feel the need to rehearse conversations, ask yourself what would happen if you spoke from a place of more genuine expression. If you are caught in a cycle of future-tripping, get curious about what elements of your present self you would most like to prepare for the future. Ask yourself when overthinking has benefited you and when it has eaten away your time. Find your patterns, and carefully examine why these patterns came to be. Pay attention to what you are fixating on, and you will find clues about what parts of your life might need a bit of extra loving attention.¬†

I need some advice with life,1,qxv1x2,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qxv1x2/i_need_some_advice_with_life/,4,"Hello. I'm a young teen that has always just been someone who was always insecure, thin skinned, really susceptible to criticism all my life. I guess I just had a low confidence/self-love for most of my life and it was subconscious. Recently, after a big shake up after getting friend-zoned from a girl due to her having past emotional baggage that traumatised her from dating anyone (which I was completely respectful to and understood), I was at an all time low. But I was proud of myself for identifying my problems through this event, and I found my flaws I mentioned above: I'm just too insecure of a person and have little confidence in myself. All I see is flaws in myself. This is physically and mentally: at times I'm always looking at the mirror but at the same time, I can't look at my reflection because  I feel insecure and ugly. No matter how much exercise/working out I do, my brain just tells me I look bad and small and I need to be better than this. The worst part is I know that I am not a pure ugly person but my brain just keeps looking at the flaws instead of the good parts. Along with this, I just never had self confidence or any sort of resilience or a strong sense of self-identity. You could say I was always just a pretty wimpy person. Trying to get somewhere in this attempted relationship, I saw myself in hindsight essentially ""simping"" or trying so hard to appeal to her through changing myself instead of just having my head up high and being myself and moving on if she did not like my identity. And frankly, I've been doing stupid things for the past year in an attempt to appeal or try to appeal or get ""popular"" as they might say in school/social circles. I'm glad I found out this problem and I want to change it, but I don't know what step I need to take from here. I've heard picking up hobbies, finding another drive in life and stuff like that can help move on from things like this and build self-confidence. The problem is I've never really been a very active and out-going guy which I don't like about myself. I'm typically just an indoors person who did nothing tbh except play video games, watch youtube, etc. I would really appreciate it if I could get some life-changing advice/help from this subreddit. My main problem is I'm just not satisfied with my true self identity, and thats why Im so susceptible to things like this in life e.g. softcore bullying/criticism, friendzones, etc. I need help either learning to be satisfied with my identity or learning to improve it to be satisfied.

If we're not our thoughts - what are we?,1,qxq0fb,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qxq0fb/if_were_not_our_thoughts_what_are_we/,0,"Lets start off with the easy part: the simple answer to who we are is that we‚Äôre an awareness. Sam Harris‚Äô book Waking Up explores the idea of our consciousness in detail but in short you are a conscious being and the awareness of that consciousness is happy, calm and free. Life gets more complicated though as that consciousness interacts with the world. We get exposed to lots of things that then get stored in the back room of our consciousness - concepts, ideologies, knowledge, beliefs and more than anything else, experiences. Some of those experiences are joyful - we tend not to hold onto these for very long. Some of them are traumatic and we do hold onto those. 

All of our concepts, knowledge, experiences and everything else we accumulate get layered on top of our consciousness to the point that our perception is viewed through the lens of experience without our even being aware of it most of the time. Our true, fundamental selves is obscured by our traumas.

This is where looking at the question of who we are through the lens of enlightenment comes in. The most commonly reported experiences of spiritual awakening are:

 - A pure consciousness event to the point of oblivion of the self;

 - A letting go of attachments, beliefs and traumas;

 - A deep sense of peace;

 - A profound interconnection with all beings and the world - interbeing TNH

The elements of enlightenment draw a helpful border around who we are and who we‚Äôre not. We‚Äôre not our beliefs, our traumas and the things we‚Äôre attached to. We are at our most calm and happy when we focus our awareness to the point of *being* awareness. 

And it is at our core to feel a deep compassion for other human beings and the earth that we live on. We forget that sometimes because we‚Äôre so caught up in worries - but when we practice being present our compassion comes flooding back.

So enlightenment sounds great, how do we make it happen? Striving for enlightenment is an attachment and will get in the way of your practice. The Buddha himself, when asked on his death bed what the secret to enlightenment was, pointed to the eightfold noble path - the basic everyday practices of mindfulness - being aware, speaking kindly, gaining insight, acting ethically. Rather than viewing enlightenment as an explosive, instant event, seeing it more as a path over your lifetime, a journey, an adventure towards awakening.

This is in no way saying that people with small foreheads are ugly! In fact you guys are usually very very pretty, but we big fore-headers get it so bad and are called mega mind or something like that, so this is just a pep talk to my fellow brothers and sisters)

I'm mostly saying this because I've been really insecure of my five-head recently, and whenever I feel down about it I remind myself these women exist;

Natalie is literally one of the most gorgeous women I have ever seen! She has a big forehead but no one thinks its unattractive because of her beautiful dainty features. Now imagine her without the forehead. Uh huh, would be weird, wouldn't it?

Ok, she is literally considered to be the most beautiful woman ever, so adds to the theory that we big foreheads are hotter! Once again, if you took away the forehead it doesn't give you the same charm as she had before.

Like Angelina, Rihanna is also considered to be one of the most beautiful woman to exist, and I don't doubt it. She has elegant, dreamy features that the forehead emphasizes more. And who doesn't love to have their pretty features emphasized?

Jessica Alba is literally so adorable! And her forehead adds to the cuteness. She made me believe that us five-heads can still be cute even with big features!

God, thank you so much for creating this beautiful being that is Uma Thurman! Ever since I watched Kill Bill, I fell in love with Uma. She's so captivating and even though some say she's not good looking (which is crazy?) she proves them wrong with her smirks and sly eyes. I would protect this women at all costs!

I'm not a big fan of Garner, but you do have to admit she pulls the forehead look off well!

Another Kill Bill star, Lucy Liu is up there with some of the best looking ladies to grace the planet! Most of this is due to her freckles and uneven alluring eyes, but I didn't even realize she had a big forehead until I went out searching everyone's head sizes. That's with a lot of big headers, too. Gives me hope that one day people won't notice the bulging blank void above my eyebrows...

&#x200B;

Another one of my favorites, Reese is so cute! And like I said with Lucy, I didn't even realize her forehead until now! She has round small features, and can get away with the forehead because of that. Or maybe because FOREHEADS ARE AWESOME??

&#x200B;

Lastly, because I'm getting tired of typing and searching for images, (there were a lot more hotties with foreheads, don't worry) here's Alexis Bledel! Or to some of you, myself included, Rory Gilmore! At a time where I first started caring about what others thought about me, and my image and looks, 13 year old me was inspired by Rory. She's so obviously gorgeous! And the best part is that you know she has a five-head, but you don't care because it's kinda cute on her. I learn't to embrace my drifting hairline due to Rory and I will always remember her for that. Thank you Alexis!

So, I hope this made you feel a bit better about what goes on up there, and maybe give you some confidence! I know it gives me a boost whenever the mirror comes around to haunt me! Bye!!",1637188997.0

Why do I deserve love?,10,qvn58q,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qvn58q/why_do_i_deserve_love/,3,"I recently discovered that I have never really loved myself very much, if at all. I have never felt hatred for myself, but I have always felt inadequate and unworthy of love. An example of this is when I had a girlfriend for 3 years, and I constantly worried about losing her because deep down I felt I didn‚Äôt deserve her, and that she could definitely do better than me.

I have recently started to offer myself self-compassion and that has felt amazing. I feel as though I am finally on my own side. But I‚Äôm not sure have a deep feeling of self-love. When I try to cultivate it in someway, I feel a little bit blocked. I feel like I‚Äôm close but not quite there. It feels like I need to find good reason to feel love.

# Negative / contamination storytelling - bad

Some examples, if you tend to tell stories

* how difficult your life is
* how X person did this to you (stole your credit, took your stuff, made you feel bad)
* how everything always goes wrong
* how life isn't fair

This is known as negative storytelling, also known as ""Contamination Storytelling""

Contamination stories, like its name, these stories leads to contamination, weaknesses  and disempowerment.

Most of the time, people who subscribe to this way  of storytelling consciously or unconsciously create and perpetuate more

* feelings of powerlessness or
* feeling like a victim

*It's  a very tempting and common way of telling stories (aka moaning /  whining / complaining)...but I want to introduce a different and better  way of story telling.*

Which can actually help bring you forward.

# Redemptive storytelling - good

People   who believe their lives are meaningful, worth something, they tend to   tell stories that are filled with hope, growth, lessons  learnt and  love.

Redemptive stories bring about stronger sense of identities and empowerment and they continue to feel that

* their lives have purpose and meaning
* they have sense of control

# No denials or lies needed

I don't believe in lying at all. Denials too.

We  don't have to lie or ""spin"", truths are truths, but we can reframe the  way we tell our stories by making small tweaks, micro-edits to your  personal stories, you can  feel very powerful effects on your self of  self, purpose and well being.

How to change your inner dialogue for your own good?

I use these words: What I learnt & What I Hope

* using  the words ""What I learnt"" makes you take on the hat of a student, where   you're learning and finding lessons in the experience
* using the words ""What I hope"" puts a perspective of hope in the future

So instead of saying, my life is so difficult, you can reframe it very specificly to say:

*I   learnt to hone and harness patience working in this painful place, and  I hope this patience that I learnt becomes a powerful ability when I   became a mum / dad / fur parent / entrepreneur etc*

# Reframing our narrative and stories positively for a better life experience and mental health

I share this is because I know we not only create our own personal histories as we live and experience life forward, BUT we must remember   that we have the power and ability to write, rewrite and reframe our   life stories to live life with meaning, love and purpose...

*...just by choosing what we want to focus on.*

Sounds so simple, but can be difficult too. Today, I encourage you to choose to fill your stories with hope, growth, lessons and love.

What stories will you tell going forward?

Tips for learning how to begin self love?,10,qtvp60,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qtvp60/tips_for_learning_how_to_begin_self_love/,8,"Recently I went through a pretty messy break up. I was dating this guy and everything was going perfectly until one of his depressive episodes started again and he dumped me. It was sudden and it seemed like he lost all feelings for me overnight. I was so upset thinking what did I do wrong and how I could fix him and our situation. I felt disposable and like he was just being mean. After a while I realized it had nothing to do with me but the fact he couldn‚Äôt handle himself. When I started accepting that fact I looked into how other people coped when their partners do things like this. I read an interesting note that said if you find yourself spiraling after your partner acts upon their depression, it probably means you haven‚Äôt taken the self care that YOU need. 

I deeply thought about it and realized I‚Äôve never really given myself the same care that I give other people. In the case of my now ex-boyfriend, when he got depressed I cleaned his room, cooked healthy meals for him, made sure he did activities that could make him feel better. But at the same time my room wasn‚Äôt clean, I wasn‚Äôt eating healthy or cooking for myself, I rarely do activities strictly for me. I have always been a ‚Äúglam‚Äù girl so my make up and hair is almost always done and figured that was enough self love. I guess a part of the reason why it hurts so bad when he left also had to do with the fact that the things we would do were things I probably needed to be doing for myself. It made me feel great taking care of him but it‚Äôs only in relationships when I take care of myself.

Growing up I had a single mom. I know she didn‚Äôt mean to, but she always made me feel like my emotions did not matter. If somebody did or said something rude to me she told that it was probably my fault. I was always held to a strong accountability for my actions and reprimanded harshly for small things. I allowed people to say hurtful things because I‚Äôve believed that it was deserved in someway. 

I feel that this break up was my sign to finally start showing and feeling the love that I give to others back to myself. Has anybody gone through something similar? What were some things you did to begin your self love journey?",1636913619.0

You are not your thoughts- practice stepping back from difficult thoughts and feelings to observe them from a distance,28,qslydw,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qslydw/you_are_not_your_thoughts_practice_stepping_back/,1,"Imagine one of your friends is a mechanic and you‚Äôre giving them a lift somewhere in your car. You're driving along and the car starts to make a horrible screeching noise. Your friend asks how long has the car been making that noise and you say, 'it‚Äôs always like this, its just a noise the car makes.' We'd probably expect our friend to suggest that we look into it, even if we just accept it.

And we do that with ourselves - we can identify with difficult thoughts and feelings where we think it‚Äôs part of us rather than something we‚Äôre experiencing. Because of our past experiences, because of our upbringing or because of traumas, we can have our own screeching thoughts and feelings that we‚Äôve got so used to that we literally think that it‚Äôs us. Suffering exists, but we don‚Äôt have to suffer and we can certainly reduce our suffering if we‚Äôre willing to look under the hood.

The mind is an incredible tool, like a computer or a phone, but rather than us leading it and focusing on what we want, it leads us to anxieties about the future and regrets from the past. We shouldn‚Äôt ignore this - in fact when our mind leads us there we need to notice it, acknowledge it and then bring ourselves back to the present. But our mind doesn‚Äôt have to dictate how we feel, just as a computer doesn‚Äôt tell you what to do - hopefully you tell it what you want it to do! We can do the same with our mind if we separate ourselves, if we distance ourselves from our thoughts and feelings. We can do this with a few simple trainings.
 
Firstly is setting the intention, literally saying to yourself, ‚ÄúI am not my thoughts.‚Äù Drilling that into your head regularly will transform your experience of difficult periods - rather than being lost at sea when things get tough you can take a step back and observe your thoughts and feelings without judging or getting involved with them.

Second, you can stop feeling ashamed or punishing yourself for having thoughts and feelings and give yourself permission to not be OK. For a long time I felt ashamed about the anxiety I felt - but that reaction was actually more harmful and more destructive than the anxiety. Letting go of that impulse to berate myself meant that I could say that it‚Äôs OK to feel anxious. Its OK to feel sad. You can label thoughts without judgement rather than react to them - that's an anxious thought, that's a happy thought, that's a planning thought.

The last suggestion is training ourselves to decouple difficult feelings from reactive action. Its OK to feel angry as long as that doesn‚Äôt lead to reactions that harm others. Its too easy for us to say, ""well that's just what I‚Äôm like, I‚Äôve got a fiery personality."" We can work on noticing thoughts and feelings as they arise, being less reactive and stopping, breathing before doing anything when we‚Äôre aware we‚Äôre in a heightened state. Know your stress behaviours, know your stress triggers and practice walking away from them.

I also would like to look better for pictures, whenever I look at pictures of myself the first thing I look at first is how big my stomach looks in it.

I don't mind my weight at times because I actually think I look cute with the little chub that I have and I especially like my thighs üòÖ

Even tho I kinda do want to loose the weight at the same time I don't ....I honestly don't see that point of putting all that hard work into something that's temporary, like eventually I'll be pregnant sometime in the future and all the weight will come back ....what if the person I'm with no longer finds me attractive because they liked it better that I was skinny and choose another girl who's skinnier ...that's one of my biggest fears and so in my mind in order to prevent it I just stay the same and have whoever I'm with love me and accept me who I am now with the weight I have instead of being skinny",1636565303.0

Anyways.. the post .. 
So I went to the beach the other day, steadily walking, taking in the air, sun, etc, then I start to feel stillness, and then to start daydreaming, then my brain starts to think and I just start whispering to myself. And after it was over.. I reflected back on what happened, what went through my mind during my walk, on my phone, here is what I wrote... ü•∫


What if things don't work out, 
Im walking on thin glass, 
Carefully choosing my steps, 
Sliding my feet, holding my heart, 

A gentle breeze blows, it cools me down, 
Feeling my skin, feeling nothing but peace now, 
Around me, it's quiet, til i see clouds above
Shadow, They know how I feel right now, 
I sink but I stand on solid ground, I am aware where I am, 

the sun shines through the clouds, 
I look up, covering my eyes, it's warmth touches my skin gently,
Reminding me I'm here, I'm alive, 
Telling me the storm has passed, 
A start all over again, 
Seeing my old steps, in the sand, 
I've come far, through this, I've made it 
Closing my eyes, feeling the breeze, 
Taking breaths, relaxation I feel, 
A small pain lingers, but fades away, 
My heart, my brain, together, in harmony, my mind , quietly
Feeling the sand, the sun, I hear 
The sound of the waves, not so loud, not so quiet, I feel a peace through me, 
inside me, a calm as flat as the sand shore, flowing through like the river springs,
I found inner peace, happiness glows from within, as bright as a star üå∏üåüüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my soul lets out a gentle smile, I smile back with a tear, what a wonderful day, I softly whispered, I embrace what I feel, with everything I got.

A little realization,3,qqffgb,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qqffgb/a_little_realization/,0,"I'm on the journey to appreciate myself more than I did before. I used to question myself constantly and worry about what and how I said things. I'm usually quiet, and introverted in a group. However, when the topic of the convo is something I'm passionate about I talk to people more. My past experiences with socializing made my confidence worse, obviously I'm not trying to imply that every person contributed to this because I haven't met everyone but the people that I came in contact with were problematic. They were people who tried to make me feel like I'm not smart enough, I talk too much, I'm rude but they always act like I'm the issue but in actuality, I always tried to be nice to people because I know people got their own problems ( I used to be a people pleaser which is horrible ) but no one ever wanted to talk to me or even try to be polite. This resulted in me thinking that I'm not good enough but I realize I wasn't ever the problem, if someone doesn't like me then so be it. I love myself and I only want people around me who can appreciate me for who I am. If someone doesn't like how I speak, then okay, that's fine but I'm not changing myself if it's not something negative. They have to go fix themselves if they try to make me feel inferior to them. I'm unlearning my people pleaser tendencies. I'm loving myself more and more every day. I realized that I have to live with myself forever. To be honest, I am gonna admit that I'm a great friend, and interesting person. I would want someone like me in my life. I appreciate people a lot and those bad experiences are not gonna make me stop making friends or being nice to people.

We can face uncertainty with love.,1,qqfbnl,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qqfbnl/we_can_face_uncertainty_with_love/,0,"We, as humans, have a tough task of balancing our conflicting needs for stability and novelty. This tension can lead us to feel perpetually uncertain, unsettled, and unmotivated. You can face uncertainty in your life with love for yourself and for those around you. The search for certainty allows your doubts to run the show, while an approach of curiosity can help you find more balance.¬†

#### Let go of timelines

We get a lot of advice about timelines. They are cultural, personal, imposed, and, ultimately not a tool that serves us in moments of uncertainty. If you are operating on a strict timeline, chances are you have taken an approach that ignores your humanity. Rushing yourself out of uncertainty won‚Äôt rush you into where you need to be. Rather, it will rush you to take steps you haven‚Äôt been able to think and feel through. In order to live with uncertainty, we have to abandon some of the timelines that we have set, or that have been set for us. Making a decision by a certain date won‚Äôt ensure you will be ready to make it at that time. There is no rush in the big things. You won‚Äôt miss what is meant for you unless you are too preoccupied with setting up a timeline that doesn‚Äôt fit your current circumstances.¬†

#### Let go of control¬†

When the big parts of life feel as though they are in flux, you might feel a desire to control whatever parts you can. Getting to more solid footing isn‚Äôt about control. It is about letting things unfold how they will. The more you aim to control an outcome, the more you will face painful reminders that you simply aren‚Äôt in control. The world is too chaotic. Love yourself through the chaos by carefully exercising agency where you can and where you have the energy to do so. Take breaks from overanalyzing the uncertainty and just let things be as they are until the dust settles a bit and you can see more clearly.¬†

#### Remember, there isn‚Äôt always an answer

From animal sounds, to times tables, to college theses, we spend much of our early lives looking for answers. This training can make the search for rigid thinking and answer seeking appealing when things feel uncertain. However, in times of uncertainty, there aren‚Äôt always answers. There is no right answer to questions about where you should be, who you should be with, and how you should be doing things. There are choices you make, and many of those best choices are made through action guided by intuition. There is no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to spend the days, years, decades. Love yourself thoroughly by letting go of the quest for answers to ease the uncertainty. Allow your thinking to be flexible, open, and frequent.¬†

#### Reframe your approach

If you find yourself butting your head against walls of uncertainty, it can be helpful to reframe your approach. Ground yourself in the present and find the things you love about where you have gotten thus far. Use uncertainty as an exercise of looking around at your life and finding what does and doesn‚Äôt work for you. Approach uncertainty not as a failure of certainty or decisiveness, but rather as an opportunity to learn more about yourself. If you feel unsettled, it might be because you are on the search for what is going wrong, as opposed to what is going right. As much as you can, look at the benefits of not knowing. Uncertainty is a beautiful classroom with no answers and a surplus of growth and self-knowledge.¬†

#### Dwell on what could go right

To that end, when you are exploring uncertainty, you can show yourself love by dwelling on what could go right. This isn‚Äôt a plug for toxic positive thinking, rather, it is a genuine reminder that no matter where you are, there are opportunities for things to go well. Tell yourself the stories of what might work out. Tell yourself stories of what you are capable of. If you are going to be preoccupied with the unknown, let your preoccupation be about the great things that often come from internal and external chaos.¬†

#### Find stability where you can¬†

We are not the decision makers of so many of the things that make up a life. We don‚Äôt get to choose which jobs will accept us, which talents come more naturally to us, or who wants to be in our lives. So, when the big things are unclear, find rest and stability where you can. Spend time with the people who ground you. Set a routine that works for this season of your life. Lean into the things and communities that neutralize the many moving parts around you. Stability can be a resting place for love.¬†

#### Make choices that can move you towards where you want to be

When you don‚Äôt know where you want to go or what you want to do, it can help to make choices that move you in the direction you think you want to be. We can‚Äôt know until we try. Thinking about what something might be like provides much less clarity than making purposeful steps in the direction you choose. Steps in any direction are better than sitting and waiting until a moment of perceived certainty arrives. Movement in the direction you want to go, even if you aren‚Äôt sure, will get you out of a place where it feels like things are happening to you. You will instead be able to feel like you are the one making things happen. Then, if you find that wasn‚Äôt the right direction, you will be practiced in switching directions. Movement will help you to get unstuck. This is an act of courage and an act of love.

An ugly realization,7,qoxm7l,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qoxm7l/an_ugly_realization/,5," I have become recently aware of how I hold myself back from being genuine while interacting with people out of fear that the true me won't be accepted or valued. The truth is I want to treat people with kindness and love but often repress those impulses to prevent being hurt as I was in the past. I know it is something I should work on and I am trying to do it, but it is very hard to look at myself that closely and admit I don't like the image I see in the mirror, or the tone of my voice, or the way I walk or use my body in general. I think I am so far from any stereotype of attractiveness that no matter I go to the gym, study, or make more money. I still have a very hard time being loving myself.

My relationships never worked for more than a couple of years and for very long I have suspected my friends tolerate me more than they care about me or appreciate me. 

I know this comes from a childhood that did not give me the love and support I needed when I made a mistake, and I cannot change that, it is the past. But, it let me with a negative inner dialog that tells me constantly I am not enough, and I am a fraud. This sets off manic cycles of study and exercise that end up with a binge of drugs and alcohol when I reach saturation. After that, shame comes back for not ""being enough"" or ""doing enough"" and the workaholic/trainaholic cycle starts over...

My system is shame-based. Is there some other way I could base my motivations? What is the alternative to shame? Is it love for others and oneself?

We share a room in the dorms , and it has been really tough being around her. I have been getting anxiety when she's around to the point I could not sleep and then would wake really early the next day. I couldn't eat, I would eat  once a day and felt like vomiting. Whenever something happens she would give me the silent treatment and give me the cold shoulder. She calls me her best friend but I don't want to be her best friend it's exhausting my body is literally rejecting this relationship. Even when I would call her to ask her about something she would be rude and she'll be like what? what's wrong? what's going on? then I would tell her nothing I am just asking you.  I would wonder sometimes why is she mad at me for cause sometimes I wouldn't even now why. It's really exhausting. She talks about our friend and about how she can't have her in our room then whenever something happens and she would get mad then she calls  her telling her all about it and when I ask her what's wrong she would say that nothing is wrong.

"If your mind won‚Äôt be quiet, don‚Äôt stress - it‚Äôs not designed to be switched off. But you can train it to be calmer a little every day",3,qo1vry,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qo1vry/if_your_mind_wont_be_quiet_dont_stress_its_not/,0,"Our brain has evolved over millions of years to the point where it‚Äôs probably the most complex object in the universe.  The mind has created art, philosophy, science, landed us on the moon, designed the clothes you‚Äôre wearing. But all of these accomplishments mask what the real primary purpose of the mind is - which is to keep you alive.

That reasonable purpose of self-preservation leads to a great deal of suffering. The mind is on the constant lookout for danger. The first thing to realise is that you are not your mind - you are a consciousness, an awareness and more fundamental. Your mind is a tool that you use. So when your mind contains thoughts, it‚Äôs very important not to confuse experiencing those thoughts with being those thoughts. 

The second insight is that your mind can‚Äôt be switched off.  Imagine if we could switch our minds off when we didn‚Äôt want to be bothered by thought - we‚Äôd be juggling knives and drinking bleach all over the place. Our mind has kept us alive for millions of years so naturally there isn‚Äôt an off switch. This is obvious but it‚Äôs important to be aware of because we can sometimes judge ourselves for having repetitive, intrusive thoughts that we can‚Äôt get rid of. That‚Äôs the mind just doing it‚Äôs job and we don‚Äôt have to hit the panic button and worry because our mind is busy - we can step back from it and accept it. Accepting our mind just the way it is, without wishing it was calm is the first step to calming it. 

To allow our minds to settle, we have to train it in a couple of ways. The first is to be less reactive and we do that by getting into the practice of noticing thoughts as they arise - we can set a reminder bell once an hour to stop and notice the thoughts that are running through our head, what feelings we have associated with them, events from the past that might be feeding into those thoughts. The second way we can train ourselves is to watch our thoughts from a distance, seeing them for what they are, which is something that you experience but are not tied to.

And in doing this we can become friends with our mind and it can start to calm, relax and enjoy life a bit more.

We can recognize our faults with love.,10,qls9yx,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qls9yx/we_can_recognize_our_faults_with_love/,7,"Moments in which we are faced with our faults and imperfections can be painful. It can be easier to deny our role in things than to admit we are playing a role at all. Every system gets the exact outcomes that it was designed to get. If we don‚Äôt like the outcome, there needs to be a realization that the system was created to be faulty. This is true on a grand scale of the systems that fail us, and it is also true in our personal lives, in our relationships, and in our expectations.

#### Reset expectations

So many of our faults reveal themselves in our unmet expectations. We have a duty to ourselves, our loved ones, and our work to create expectations that are honest about who we are and what we are capable of. Our expectations of ourselves and others can lead us to create systems that fail, or they can lead us to outcomes that work and that nurture us. We must first recognize our own faults in each role we play, and how to set expectations that we can meet. This has to be done with love. Part of self love and loving those around us is being honest. Honesty, then, is an act of love. Be honest about what you can do and about who you are.¬†

#### Let go of perfection

As you are recognizing your faults, let go of perfection. Perfection has no place in setting you up to understand yourself, your role, and your shortcomings. You wouldn‚Äôt be who you are without your faults, so honor them. Work on them if you want to and if you have the energy and time to do so, but don‚Äôt do so in an effort to make yourself into a perfect person. This mindset is riddled with faults.¬†

#### Be kind

Kindness is a critical ingredient in recognizing your shortcomings. Faults aren‚Äôt failures. They are a reality of being you. So be kind to yourself. Be honest, but not brutally so. Sometimes, greatness comes from faults. If you can recognize that you tend to rush through things, think of the times that rushing has allowed you to get things done in a timely manner. See how your shortcomings have contributed to outcomes you have learned from and grown from. When your faults have led to dysfunction or things you didn‚Äôt want, learn from them. These are lessons that can be learned with kindness and without shame.¬†

#### Be patient¬†

Recognizing your faults is not the same as addressing them. Learning about yourself and working on your shortcomings does not happen overnight. It happens with practice and with patience. It can feel a bit like whack-a-mole to find and address all the ways you are contributing to the things you don‚Äôt want. Ask for your own patience and for the patience of those around you. Expecting immediate change is unreasonable and unattainable and may dissuade you from the honesty that this long journey demands.¬†

#### Tell yourself a new story

So much of our lives are wrapped up in the stories we tell ourselves. Tell yourself a story about your shortcomings that is kind and allows for growth. Talk yourself out of rigidity of thinking. You have to tell yourself a story that you can believe, and one that is true. You are not on this planet to be perfect. You are on this planet to love. Love is imperfect, but you can set yourself up to live within a story that is genuine and true.

Nobody is perfect - A few thoughts on self-love and perfectionism,12,qloqtt,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qloqtt/nobody_is_perfect_a_few_thoughts_on_selflove_and/,0,"Writing this down partly to order my thoughts, as well as adding to the collection of inspirational perspectives found on this sub. No solutions here. This is a work in progress.

Like many of you, I struggle with self-hatred, lack of self-respect and overall low self-esteem. 

I'm constantly demeaning myself for mistakes I did in the past while at the same time trying my utmost to forgive and rationalize mistakes done by those around me. I'm always pressuring myself to conform to high ideals and specific aesthetics I am in not able to meet. I often believe that I'm not achieving my potential and that I'm therefore living my life the wrong way.

I often hate myself for being too weak to actually do what I deem to be the best path of action. Too weak, too scared, too undisciplined, too driven by instinct. I therefore see myself not worthy of many things. At the same time I do not want to hate others for their apparent weaknesses. Rather, I always try to be understanding and to find sympathy for them. After all: To err is human and nobody is perfect.

So as I see it right now, the path to self-love for me seems to be solving the difficult problem of how to deal with my faults and weaknesses. 

It is not as simple as accepting all my faults and weaknesses and simply living with them. That would make me arbitrary, unhealthy and ultimately unhappy. Trying to improve and having ideals is not inherently wrong, but can be good and beautiful thing.

It's more about finding the right balance between dealing with my weaknesses with humor while at the same time not seeing myself as a laughing-stock. Continuing to overcome my weaknesses while not burning out from the attempt. Expanding my narrow views on integrity and beauty to fit more realistic and healthy standards, while also staying true to my beliefs and values.

But I must not strive to be become perfect. Because only nobody is perfect. And I should strive to become somebody rather than nobody.",1635922071.0

I tend to feel like I would do anything for this person, or their attention or affection, and more often than not that means I will put my own needs aside, and prioritize them, even before any sort of romantic relationship has been established.

I‚Äôll preface this with the fact that I‚Äôm currently searching for a therapist to discuss this question(and others) with, but in the interim, I‚Äôm curious to see what others‚Äô take is on this.

For me, this is a question I‚Äôve started to ask myself more in earnest recently - why do people feel that they‚Äôre unloveable, or not worthy or deserving of being loved by anyone? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no easy answer, but I‚Äôve felt this way for so long now that I don‚Äôt even know exactly when it started. I do have MDD, so I know there‚Äôs a good chance that it goes hand-in-hand with that, but for the most part, my depression is otherwise well-managed, and no longer interferes with my day-to-day life - yet this is the one feeling, for me, that is constant and persistent, despite it all.

Recently, I began a new relationship with someone I love and care about, and have for quite a long time. They are kind, considerate, and make more of an effort in the relationship than my previous partner did by leaps and bounds. I‚Äôm genuinely happy when we‚Äôre together, and they seem to be, too.

Despite this, my thoughts always turn back to the same negative self-talk: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt REALLY love you, they‚Äôre just too nice to say anything; it‚Äôs out of pity,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get too happy, they‚Äôre obviously going leave you anyway, because how COULD they possibly want to be with YOU?‚Äù and so on ad infinitum.

My partner and I have been open and honest with each other about our mutual struggles with mental health from the beginning, and they‚Äôve even reassured me that my worry, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt the case‚Äù - ie, that they didn‚Äôt actually love me, but stayed with me because they were ‚Äútoo nice to say anything‚Äù or didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings. Despite this, that nagging doubt at the back of my head still comes back eventually, telling me I‚Äôm still not worthy of love.

Has anyone else ever dealt with feelings like this? If so, have you found anything that helps you cope or gain a more realistic perspective, and more importantly to practice self-love that helps, in that regard?

I've been in therapy of course and want to buckle down on it again but I was wondering if anyone, considering what I just said, could give me a suggestion for,something like an audio book that will help me practice on my own. I work over night in a lab and have a speaker which is,why I asked for the audio book option but if there are any other suggestions for things like websites, work books, practices, etc I'd love to hear about those too.

How to love yourself when you don‚Äôt know who you are,4,qjiqsl,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qjiqsl/how_to_love_yourself_when_you_dont_know_who_you/,5,"Hey guys I‚Äôm a long time lurker of this post. I began going on my self-love journey seriously when a couple of months ago I thought my boyfriend and I were going to break up. I put a couple things together and realize that every time we aren‚Äôt good or it seems that our relationship me and I spiral out of control and I am unable to be with myself emotionally. I thought about how in high school and the subsequent years that followed I would always have someone to lean on emotionally whether it be a friend or most times a boyfriend.

I noticed that every time I get into a relationship with someone they become my entire world and I don‚Äôt know what I like to do or how to get myself out of a rut. I‚Äôve tried meditating and I tried doing five minutes of deep breathing and that helps me at least regulate my emotions so I don‚Äôt physically and outwardly lose control of them e.g. crying or heading things. I guess I was just wondering if you guys had any advice to offer because right now I‚Äôm at a loss. I know I have to find things that I like to do but I fear that I may have to be alone soon and I already feel so alone now and I can‚Äôt even bear actually having to deal with myself 24 seven no distractions.

I know y‚Äôall will suggest it but I definitely have started looking for a therapist and hopefully I can help but I know a majority of the work needs to be put in by me. Again thank you so much for those of you if you got this far and decide to respond",1635657474.0

Hiccup in my self love journey,2,qj7k9n,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qj7k9n/hiccup_in_my_self_love_journey/,0,"I recently just got out of a situation with a girl I was dating. We met on tinder. In her bio she said that she was looking for a relationship and she was looking for somebody who‚Äôs transparent and emotionally available. After that first date I started to have strong feelings for her. It seemed like we just clicked. It felt like a real and honest connection. We had real talks about real shit. About life, death, our pasts, shit were trying to work on, theories on why things are the way they are, just intellectual shit. After the first week or so of constant texting, she started to distance herself more. I would message her throughout the day and she would just read it and not respond. I ended up confronting her about it and she tried to downplay it and sort of turned it on me; saying it‚Äôs only been 2 weeks and she doesn‚Äôt see the point in texting and would rather talk in person or over the phone. We just recently ended things because she said she needed to work on loving herself and wasn‚Äôt capable of giving me what I need. 

I feel she used me to get unique insights on life and to almost have a sort of therapist she could date. Towards the end she told me she doesn‚Äôt like me as much as I like her and that she was intimidated by how reserved I am for her and how nobody has ever treated her like that before. (I would remember things about her and bring her a little something she liked ever time I saw her, like her favorite candy bar or a donut) just little things like that; or I would remember little details about her and she would be surprised I remembered. 

It really hurt me when she decided she didn‚Äôt want me to be in her life anymore and I‚Äôm still trying to process everything but I‚Äôm starting to feel more like I was just used and once she didn‚Äôt need me anymore she just removed me. I was always there for her and she was never there for me. I was only valued for the support I offered her at the time. I‚Äôm a very generous and thoughtful person and when I feel like I‚Äôm getting taken advantage of I get really upset. 

I also try to be as authentic as I possibly can and I think sometimes that should be gradually introduced rather than throwing it all at somebody like my life depended on it. Maybe I looked desperate. Maybe I looked weak. I can still be myself without putting all my cards out on the table right away. A little mystery is always exciting. Who knows though. 

The upside to this is that she brought some of my core beliefs to my attention and now I‚Äôm aware and can work on these beliefs, such as
 
I‚Äôm not worthy of love

I‚Äôll never be good enough

I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy


There‚Äôs somebody out there for us that will love us for who we are and not just what we have to offer. And we do have a lot to offer. Most people just can‚Äôt see it. Keep growing. Keep doing the hard work. Life changes quickly. You never know what‚Äôs right around the corner.",1635618820.0

The insight of non-toothache is that feeling is accessible to us at any time - we can stop and feel the aliveness of our bodies. Feeling the blood in your veins, the air in your lungs, the electric  impulses through your nerves, the feeling of pressure temperature across your body. You can do this anytime for a moment, for ten minutes, whenever you get a chance.

To be clear, this isn‚Äôt toxic positivity - we‚Äôre being real and present with our experience which may include fear, anger or pain. But even when times are difficult and our minds are very busy we have the opportunity to stop and enjoy our neutral, normal feelings. Normally we don‚Äôt focus on the body, we barely register them unless there‚Äôs something wrong. But taking joy in and feeling gratitude for the everyday functions of the body is a recipe for happiness. 

And we can really grab that moment with the external things the body experiences. I‚Äôm a big fan of Twin Peaks and the main character Agent Cooper loves his coffee - he takes a drink and says ‚ÄòThat is -excuse me- a damn fine cup of coffee.‚Äô He revels in it, he savours it and that's when life takes off, when you can stop for a moment for the big stuff, the small stuff and the neutral stuff and say ‚Äòdamn it feels good.‚Äô So next time you‚Äôre having a tea or a coffee or your beverage of choice, switch off the TV for a moment, focus on everything you can sense from the drink and say out loud, 'that is a damn fine cup of coffee.' Same with a walk in the park, 'damn its a beautiful day.' Same with brushing your teeth, 'damn that electric toothbrush feels good.' It sounds too simple to be effective, but it works and it‚Äôs all waiting for you in every moment. You just have to reach out and grab it.

Need advice because I am stuck,4,qe12y4,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qe12y4/need_advice_because_i_am_stuck/,4,"Hello reddit, this is my first post ever and I'm slightly nervous about it. I don't know if this is the right place , but I do need advice. Since I'm mentioning things about my past, this might be triggering for people who have been bullied or are depressed.

I (23F) have always struggled with actually liking myself. I'm an introvert and have been really shy in the past as well. That's also the reason why I was bullied in school. It started slowly, but got really bad in 9th/10th grade when I was 14 -16 (I'm now 23). People were laughing when I said anything in class (I rarely did), then they made fun of me when I didn't say anything. I was called ""mute"" and ""stupid"" by teachers and classmates for two years, people avoided me, told me they didn't want to be around me, they were almost disgusted when they had to sit next to me. Even back then I never understood why it was happening to me, because I didn't even know these people.

While I was already shy back then, going to school became a nightmare. I was basically nervous 24/7 , became scared of even leaving the house, always felt sick and like I was about to faint and was visibly shaking when the teachers asked me something or I had to say something in class. My mind always went blank when people asked me something and I started stuttering as well. This was the point, when I started disliking myself. Over time, I learned do despise myself. I came to the conclusion that something must be inherently wrong with me, otherwise this wouldn't have happened.

Because that was impacting my life so much, my dad talked me into going to counceling. He actually came with me to the first session, because I couldn't leave the house on my own and I couldn't talk about my problems without sobbing. I went there for 1 to 1,5 years and when I stopped I did feel better. Counseling really helped me to dissolve some of the thought patterns I had created. I was still and introvert and also still shy, but it got better.

The next couple of years and especially in the last two I really focused on building my self-esteem and learning to like myself as well as building a life I like. I started drawing and painting again, because that's what I liked to do, I started dressing the way I wanted but never dared to in the past; did go to counseling back then and also to hypnosis; started working out to feel better about myself; made an effort to change my thoughts and flip the negative ones; read a lot of self-help books and tried applying the techniques to my life, went down the more spiritual route (tarot, astrology, chakras) to figure out who I am and what blockages I have - but I realized I am stuck. I don't see any improvement anymore. I thought I was on a good way and had at least somewhat of a solid found of self-esteem, but today I realized that nope, that was not the case.

I'm 23 years old and I have never been in a relationship, though I would really want to find love. I also realize the importance of working on myself before (and also during) a relationship, so it's not like I would jump at any opportunity presenting itself to me. And just today I was talking to my grandma and one point she said that no one in my family actually believes that I would ever be in a relationship. I didn't think it would affect me that much, but my god, it did. I ended up breaking down crying, because I saw this as proof that still, there was something wrong with me. And it's not just me who thinks that, but my family as well. (I don't think she had any bad intentions when she said it though). What is wrong with me? Why is this happening to me? How can I see myself as worthy? How can I like myself? Does that even make sense or am I just kidding myself?  How can I be lovable? It feels like all the effort I put into it was a waste of time - like all the effort I thought I'd see was just an illusion if I break down so easily. 

&#x200B;

In some areas of life I know I struggle, for example with socializing. I try avoiding it, because I am still scared of always being the outcast and ending up alone. I don't want to bother other people by sticking to those I know, so I end up avoiding it when I can. I'm still scared of taking classes in something I'm interested in, because going alone makes me too nervous and I, again, am scared of ending up alone and being left out. And I thought if I work on my self-worth and become more comfortable with myself, then these things would become a lot easier for me, but I sitll can't seem to make myself go there, because I'm too nervous. I'd also like to make new friends, but I don't know how and I still asume I'm too boring for people to actually like me. 

&#x200B;

So, overall, I'm stuck. Stuck with myself, stuck with life and I have no clue what to do. There is always this nagging feeling that I am just not good enough and never will be. Do you all have any advice for me? What should I do? How can I learn to truly like myself?

A little update,2,qd3pij,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/qd3pij/a_little_update/,0,"I am currently sitting in my car and feeling a bit upset. Truth be told, ‚Äúupset‚Äù is not the most accurate description of how I am feeling at this moment. I would compare this feeling of mine to a minor version of a feeling similar to the one a child has after being abandoned by their father. I know, dramatic right? Today I found out that my manager is resigning. Now you may think, as most people in a similar situation, I would be upset at all the work that is to be thrown on my plate upon this resignation. I am, however, not at all bothered by that as much as I am by the fact that I am ‚Äúlosing‚Äù someone who‚Äôs had such a great impact on my growth and evolution in this company, and at the same time in my personal development as well. Not many people consider their bosses/managers their ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but I like to consider him a friend. Maybe not a friend I can drink wine with on a Saturday night and gossip about the new makeup line Kylie Jenner just released lol. He is the type of friend who supported me, the type of friend I could trust, and who was there through some of my hardest journeys in life and tried to help as much as he could in anyway that he could. I realize that says a lot about who I am as a person - I don‚Äôt like losing people, especially the ones closest to me. That is why I grasp onto them with my dear life until the very last moment. In this case, obviously, that isn‚Äôt possible lol. But I also have come to understand that people are meant to enter and exit your life all the time. They are meant to teach you a lesson, or a few in his case, which you can then apply to situations in life you may find difficult and challenging in the future. I enjoyed being surrounded by his intellect and optimism and I am dragging being surrounded by low IQs and negativity when he‚Äôs gone - I am already aware that will drain poor miss positivity aka ‚ÄúAlexa Fjora‚Äù. But like any other challenge this is also one I am to conquer by applying the knowledge he has provided me and sticking by myself until the end. I know I can do this because of one strong fact, even though people will come and go in your life there‚Äôs one person that will always stay and that, my friends, is yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1634857373.0

Or a tiny child of ours that we absolutely loved
more than life itself. And I think it's probably
possible to achieve that. I think part of the job
we're here for is to learn how to do it.""

I have some moles on my body. Not a huge amount of them, but still a sizeable amount. My neck has the most (I'd say around 5-10), and it makes me really self-conscious about them. I don't think my face is really handsome, but I think it's fine without the moles. With them I feel several times more ugly. I've heard ""some people like moles,"" but I don't and I'm the one who has to live with my body.

I've considered getting them removed, but it would probably be really expensive and I don't want to get a scar there and feel like people judge me for trying to remove them.",1634511328.0

"Getting too attached in relationships can push people away - if you love someone, set them free",15,q9b6ls,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/q9b6ls/getting_too_attached_in_relationships_can_push/,1,"One of the most fundamental sources of suffering in relationships is attachment. You might say, why shouldn‚Äôt I be attached to my partner? How else am I supposed feel about them? Its really important to know that there‚Äôs a world of difference between love and attachment. Love is focused on the needs of the other person, attachment is focused on our needs. Love is freeing for the other person, attachment is controlling. Love is enduring, attachment is hard to sustain in the long term.

When we talk about attachment, this is shorthand for attachment of our happiness to an external condition. This is a recipe for suffering, both for you and your partner. If you cannot be happy without that person, you are inevitably going to end up unhappy whether that‚Äôs when the relationship ends or when you‚Äôre away from that person for a period of time. If you can‚Äôt be happy without the attention or love of your partner they will end up feeling trapped and suffocated. Placing your happiness on someone else‚Äôs shoulders is a hard burden to carry.

Why does this happen? All of us to some extent are insecure about ourselves - consciously or unconsciously we have beliefs about ourselves and other people that are coloured by our experience. We may have been in a relationship where we were hurt, we may have experiences from our childhood that have warped the lens that we view reality through. We can trace our attachment back through time to the past. It's important to realise and accept that because of this past trauma we don‚Äôt perceive the reality of our relationships objectively - all of us have had the experience of becoming anxious or angry about something and then finding out later that we‚Äôve jumped to the wrong conclusion based on assumptions, not a good feeling.

So what can we do? Firstly we can train ourselves to be aware when fear and anger are arising and tend to them rather than being swept away. By meditating every day and training ourselves to be present with our experience we don‚Äôt have to go straight from feeling anxious or angry to acting, we can notice the feeling, acknowledge it, accept it, listen to it and let it pass. Thich Nhat Hanh recommends not speaking at all when we‚Äôre angry - always a good idea in relationships in my experience.

When we‚Äôre ready to communicate it‚Äôs helpful to pass the anxious thoughts we‚Äôre having through a filter before speaking - is it true, is it kind, is it helpful. When our attachment is driving anxious thoughts it can be helpful to listen more than you speak. When we‚Äôre in an anxious state it‚Äôs much more difficult for us to really focus our awareness on what the other person is actually saying rather than what we‚Äôre assuming. Practice listening mindfully in the good times so that it comes more naturally in the difficult times. When we listen mindfully we‚Äôre in the moment, really focused on the other person, not judging what they‚Äôre saying, not thinking about what we‚Äôre going to say in response, giving that person our full attention.

And finally - be kind to yourself. All of us make mistakes in relationships, all of us find it hard to trust because of difficult experiences, all of us are afraid of losing the person we love. It‚Äôs normal, it‚Äôs OK, give yourself permission to not be perfect. But the funny thing is, if we practice letting go in our relationships we strengthen the bond and become much closer.

A gentle and loving reminder to myself (and anyone else who needs it?),15,q99l8d,selflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/q99l8d/a_gentle_and_loving_reminder_to_myself_and_anyone/,1,"I am not the same person I was when I made decisions that kept me in a situationship that didn‚Äôt meet my needs, chipped away at my self-esteem over time, and generally contributed to an overarching sense of anxiety and stress for months on end.

I have more information about myself, about others, about what I do need, and about how relationships work. 

It‚Äôs ok that I had that experience. I survived, I learned, I gave and received loved, I gained deep insight, no one was at fault overall, and even though it took a while, I walked away in the ultimate act of self-love despite how difficult and acutely painful that was to do.

I am not my mother. Though her decisions during my childhood taught me a lot about what relationships CAN look like, I am old enough and wise enough to know that what I learned back then was a very very narrow glimpse into how love works. As a child I internalized a pretty deep message that love is pain, but I have put so much work into analyzing, questioning, and replacing that message with more healthy and realistic ones, starting always with providing myself the love I require naturally as a human.

I forgive myself for repeating some of my mother‚Äôs patterns. So long as I learned from them and grew from them, they were not mistakes. 

I do not have to repeat the same patterns now that I am dating again. I understand why I am waking up with anxiety in the middle of the night, and I will be patient with myself because these are partially unprocessed emotions manifesting in fears. But, I know so much more than I did before, and I trust (and will keep working on feeling trust for myself) that I can act differently, and that no matter what happens I‚Äôll always have myself to come home to, to love unconditionally, to seek comfort in, to be my best supporter and friend, and I‚Äôve been actively showing myself that for months. 

I can let others in who are trustworthy, over time, inviting the full range of human intimacy that‚Äôs waiting to be experienced while maintaining healthy internal and external boundaries. I know a lot more about what that looks like now, and I‚Äôm ready to keep learning.

I can give myself permission, space and grace to keep making decisions I don‚Äôt know much about yet that may or may not turn out to be better courses of action for me, to keep pivoting if I realize they weren‚Äôt the best course of action, and love myself for being patient, open to learning, and open to experiencing not so fun emotions because they‚Äôre important to feel, too.

I can revel in the joy of the really fun emotions and speak back to the false voice that is always waiting for things to take a turn for the worse, as if it‚Äôs an inevitability rather than a trauma response.
