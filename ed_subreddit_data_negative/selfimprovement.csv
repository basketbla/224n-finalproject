Whats something you did to improve your life that makes you most proud?,448,sx26en,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sx26en/whats_something_you_did_to_improve_your_life_that/,150,"For me it’s when I started running early every morning to improve my mental health. I was going through the worst mental breakdown of my life last year. There were times were things got so bad I wouldn’t talk to anyone or bathe or do anything productive for days. But at some point I was so desperate to change my situation I started exercising. 
It was really difficult for me because I had so much anxiety I couldn’t leave my room but I pushed through and made going outside a habit. I’m not fully healed yet but I still cant think back to those early runs without crying. I think it’s because it may not seem like a huge achievement to others but as the only person who knows what I was feeling inside and knows the strength and determination it took to change my life. Im just so proud of myself. I wish I could go back in time and give myself a hug and tell my past self how brave and proud I am of her.",1645366569.0

We respect you so much.",48,sxf9hv,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sxf9hv/before_you_keep_scrolling_please_stop_for_a/,5,"Hey there, thank you so much for clicking on the post. I just want to take 2 minutes out of your day so you can just read this post. I know how much of a bad day you’re having, it’s a normal day for you isn’t it? You wake up in the morning and the first thing that comes to your mind is all the negative energy and thoughts from the night before. It’s starting to turn into a routine, isn’t it? 

I just want to remind you that we can all see how hard you’re trying to battle this, how much you want to wake up in the morning and all of these thoughts could magically disappear, we can see it, we can sense it, we know, bud. I want to remind you that this is not how your life is going to pan out, you’re not going to experience this feeling everyday, it will change, and it all starts with you. But, we know, you struggle to see the good in you, you truly believe that you’re a terrible person and you don’t deserve anything good to come to you, when in fact, it’s the complete opposite. I fully believe that if someone goes out of their own way to try and improve on themselves, even when people are criticising or talking down to them, they deserve all the good in the world, and that’s exactly what YOU deserve. In order to get to that position, don’t allow the bad days overshadow you as a person, because deep down, you’re incredibly strong, you’re so motivated to do better, and be a better person. You don’t need to look around you to see if anyone has seen a change in you, mentally and physically, because every single one of us here can. It’s a scary feeling to admit that you need to change your life around, because at the end of the day, we all do, nobody is perfect and we all need help, no matter what shape or form. But, you, you’ve come to the right place, because you’re not going to see much better places than this particular place, why? Because we all have this 1 goal in life - to improve ourselves. You may want to improve yourself as a person, improve on your attitude, your judgements, your physique, mentally etc, you’re in the right place, friend. 

We support you. Every decision you make, we will be there for you. Yes, we will screw up in life, we will make terrible mistakes, we will do bad things, we will say the wrong things, but from where I stand, the reaction is more important than the mistake. Are you shamed? Afraid? Worried? Fearful? We are here for you, as long as we have a deal, you do good and improve yourself from everything you once done, and we will be there for you. Deal? 

Do good, help other people, support one another, this shouldn’t be hard, it should be neural, we are all in the same place, let’s build eachother up to greater things. We don’t want you to suffer anymore, but it is easier said than done. If you feel as if you’re having a weak moment, come here, share your thoughts, feelings and emotions and we’ll be there for you, we will listen and turn in whenever you are ready. 

I just want to remind you that we are here for you, we care for you and we want the best for you, no matter the situation you’re in. If you ever feel alone, give us a message, plead for some help, we will be there for you, bud, we will be there for you. 

Now that you’ve taken your time to read this, I want to wish you a lovely day, wherever you are in the world, but that doesn’t matter, we are all humans, we all have our troubles, and we are all there for eachother, day or night. You’re trying to improve yourself everyday and I respect that so much from you, even though you feel as if you’ve got a mountain to climb, you put yourself first and I appreciate that, I admire it. 

I respect you for being here, I respect you for doing good for others and for yourself. You and me, we are in this together, let’s overcome the odds, let’s improve ourselves, let the past in the past and let’s strive for today, live in this moment. 

Have a great day, friend. And remember, you are so incredibly cared for.",1645401705.0

I really want to stop obsessing over people who are doing 'better' than me,7,sxc6eu,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sxc6eu/i_really_want_to_stop_obsessing_over_people_who/,3,"I'm an experienced software engineer and content creator. I'm in my mid-30's and most people would probably consider me relatively successful. Yet, I can't help but obsess over people in my field who are doing different or 'better' than me.

Higher job title, more work in the open source community, more blog posts, more subscribers, getting started younger, growing faster, getting more community recognition, etc.

It's hard for me because I can't just cut off social media, as it's how I grow my content creation channels. So I'm kind of bombarded with other people on a regular basis.

The logical side of my brain says ""You should be happy for these people and help build them up, as you've been built up. Everyone's on their own path, you're growing well, and if you keep your head down and keep working on what you have planned out, it'll lead to more success."".

But then there's the illogical side saying ""You're not moving fast enough, you're not producing fast enough, maybe there's a reason why they're doing better than you, let's find out how old are they are and when they got started, maybe that'll explain it"" and I just end up in this toxic cycle of wanting some kind of answer to their growth but knowing it's just a combination of luck, effort, and what *they* have planned for themselves.

I'd really like to be able to break out of this habit, and focus solely on me. It's not like I don't have a plan picked out. I have a to-do list all organized and prepped, but I end up losing so much time getting sucked into these mental competitions and end up procrastinating, and feeling worse afterwards.",1645393271.0
I am addicted to women and sex,275,swpi5e,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/swpi5e/i_am_addicted_to_women_and_sex/,165,"I am 24, studying law. In my childhood, I was always insecure about numerous traits about my body and personality. After having sex, I was told I was well endowed and attractive, at least thats WHEN I realized it. I slowly overcame my insecurity and now I can gladly say that i’m extremely confident in every way, but at a cost.

In a relationship, not looking at or thinking of other women was impossible, I crave it maliciously. When I am single, like now for instance, most of
my time revolves around masturbation, sex and dating. It is gotten to a point where I don’t even study or do essential tasks, I squeeze them in last minute. I have this sick addiction of having sex with NEW women, it’s always in my head and its impacting my life.

I’ve also been a solitary individual where most of my social life is women, I don’t have many male friends and I can’t seem to make ones that last, we always drift apart.

Contemplating this has left me to think that I am compensating the lack of social life with dating and sex, and the lack of dopamine from stimulators such as going out, accomplishments or working out with masturbation.

This might sound silly but I can’t stop, I tried letting go but I always fail to not masturbate for more than 24 hours.

Any similar stories or help? Ideas on how to approach this?",1645321101.0

I have been playing a lot of videogames starting around age 13 until now. Since then I have had fewer and fewer friends. I had like 3 ""friends"" who I used to hang out with in Uni and every fews weeks we would hang out in private too (but we were never really good friends imo). Now I moved 700 km away for work. Even after living in this new place for 1 year I haven't found a single friend or person to meet in my free time. Not to mention I never had a girlfriend.

I feel like I can barely hold a conversation, since I have no interesting hobbies, never travelled or experienced anything interesting. At work, my direct colleagues are older than me and in different situations in life. There are also people in my age at my work but I'm not directly working with them. And all I can talk about is work, because I have nothing going on in my private life. So I'm usually pretty quiet and boring in conversations.

I'm skinny and unfit, but I have started working out at home for the last few weeks. I'm also planning to start running outside. I still play videogames, but only because I have nothing else to do. I would love to hang out with other people or do stuff together outside.

How do I get out of this situation? I feel like the problem is, that I've become so extremely uninteresting and boring, so I can't even hold a conversation beyond superficial smalltalk.

Consuming mindless media,5,sxcg76,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sxcg76/consuming_mindless_media/,4,"I spend most of my free time just consuming. 

If it’s not gaming(which I’ve mostly quit now) then it’s searching my thoughts on Google and Reddit like “how to consume less” or “how to create music” or “why am I so unproductive” instead of actually doing things. I really spend so much of my time searching my thoughts online and trying to find others with similar opinions or experiences, many times anxiety motivated but sometimes not. I spend a lot of my time thinking or wanting to do things but most of my time actually doing nothing productive whatsoever 

I’ll watch tutorials on some new interest and then when it comes to actually doing the activity I won’t really bother, or I’ll lose interest quick. I come from a family of consumers, I grew up like this and it’s pretty sad tbh.

I always find a reason, let’s say I’m going to learn to play guitar, I watch some tutorials, in fact I probably spend 80% watching tutorials and 20% playing, then I search Reddit for tips, get sucked into Reddit but feel like I’m being productive because it’s working towards learning guitar. I decide that I should spend less time on Reddit and more time playing guitar, then I think “but I don’t know how to play, I need the internet to help or show me”

Basically I use the internet for everything, feeling anxious about something? Google in and someone on Reddit has probably posted with a similar experience before. Don’t know how to do something, better watch 20 YouTube videos. Wondering whether to buy a new phone? Better watch loads of comparison videos and read hours of Reddit posts about it. Have a random curious thought about ww2 or pigeons? Better Google it and read loads of information that I’ll never remember or just scrolling through reddits front page for hours on end 

How can I avoid this? I recently sold my laptop to quit gaming, but now it’s just replaced with my phone and more time on Reddit etc.

I thought most people were like this but actually all of my friends seem to do productive random things in their free time, baking, attentively listening to new music, 3d printing, matched betting, painting etc, and it’s like i have just grew up doing nothing in my free time, perhaps I’ll draw on a notepad for 5 mins and get bored then go back to Reddit or something, but I find it really difficult to spend my time doing actual productive things",1645394004.0

So basically they said why wouldn’t you go blah blah blah you can’t live your life without doing crazy shit like that etc. 

It basically made me think, yeah I can’t end up like this. 


If I was on a rating from -10 to 10, I’d put myself as a -1 mentally and habitually.

We live in a time when it's normal to talk really bad to ourselves.

If you feel related to what I'm saying, tell me. Why are you so hard on yourself? It's ok to make mistakes. It's ok to forget things, to be wrong. Don't harm yourself. Try to be more gentle with yourself. Treat yourself like you'd treat your best friend. Try to love yourself, instead of hating yourself. 

Maybe you think you only do that as a joke, that you don't really feel it, that it's only a way of speaking, but believe me: the way you speak to yourself reflects on how you treat and feel yourself.

I came to the realization that I'm a rather boring individual. I don't have any hobbies or interests, I don't even know what excites me or what I like. In my free time, and actually most of the time I wast my time on the computer with reddit, movies and anime. I'm in my university Final year and am particularly going through a bad phase in my life. I have grown distant from the friends I had and have barely gone out this winter. Most of the people I knew from my initial years are gone now as they moved on with their lives. I realized my friendships don't last because I'm not seriously about my life and am just living day to day with no goals/plans. I don't have any skills or interesting aspects to myself. I can hold a good conversation on history, culture, philosophy but that's about it. I don't watch sports or keep up with the latest trends.

I don't know how to go out and meet people, how to make friends at my age. It seems to come easily for so many people. They seem to know the right places to go to socialize, how people work and throw parties and hang outs. I had an especially boring teen years so I didn't develop any of these. University was my 2nd chance and although better than high school I messed it up too. It just feels like I came full circle. 

So mainly there are two things I want to learn. 
1) how to have fun by myself: How to be comfortable with loneliness and many solo activities I could try out that won't make me feel awkward for not having friends to do it with. 
2) How to bring value to a group: Meeting new friends, maintaining those friendships and not being the boring friend.

With women it doesn't go past a few dates, as they realize I have nothing going for me.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

Get in touch with how it feels to be successful (even if you aren’t there yet),12,sx0sax,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sx0sax/get_in_touch_with_how_it_feels_to_be_successful/,3,"No matter what you believe about the law of attraction, there’s a mindset you can adopt that will improve the type of energy you convey when interacting with others. 

On the surface it may sound delusional, but if you are actively pursuing that specific goal, believing you have already achieved the goal will support your focus in achieving it. Again, without consistent work toward that specific goal, this mindset is delusional daydreaming. Avoid ‘pretending’. This type of mindset shift isn’t meant to be an act, or superficial front; you are supposed to authentically feel the emotions.

As an exercise, walk into a busy cafe, store, or mall to practice this mindset. Imagine yourself as the version of yourself as you want to be seen: someone who is centered, distinguished, who has impacted others with his work. It may be difficult at first. Don’t repress yourself, imagine how it feels to be at the top. You’ll begin to notice others trying to catch a glimpse of you when you walk in their vicinity.

The more you adopt this mindset, it’ll become almost second nature. Your confidence will improve, and your interactions with others will generally more positive.

People want to be around others who are positive, and convey a sense that they can’t be deterred form what they want. Getting in frame of mind where you have already achieved helps you emit that kind of energy.

Some examples:

- If you write, put yourself in the mindset where you are a well-known author, whose work has impacted millions of people. Get in touch with how it feels to be admired, to have a skill that allows you to touch the emotions of others.

- If you are pursuing opening a business or just starting out, get in touch with your sense of independence, or the positive feelings associated with being a leader and having others rely on you.

A popular phrase I've heard a lot, and it was a huge motto at my last place of employment. (Oddly an automotive place that did accessories, detailing, & undercoating)  It wasn't until I got to this job that I understood what the phrase truly meant. 

The situation is what it is, you can't change that, but it is what you make of it that can change the outcome; whether that be in the present moment or in the future when another situation that is the same or similar arises. 

If you continue to view it in a negative perspective, that's all it's going to be. It will continue to cause problems and it will continue to upset you. But if you look at it with a positive perspective you'll likely be able to find a solution or be able to learn a valuable lesson that will be able to help you in the future. 

For example (and we'll continue with the automotive job) - Tinting windows is not as easy as it looks, especially when it comes to the back window. The glass is curved so you have to heat shrink the tint in order for it to properly fit. I would easily get frustrated, the more frustrated I got, the harder it was for me. I would quickly loose my patience, and be so focused on how frustrated and upset I was that I wasn't really learning anything or looking for a solution as to how I could possibly do it differently. 

It is what it is- I can't change the window, I can't change the tint. 

It is what I make it to be- I am responsible for my emotions, my reaction, and the method I am using. 

After taking a moment to breathe and remembering what wasn't working, I try again, focusing more on what is in front of me than what could go wrong. I know what will happen if I do it this way, so do it the other way. Go slow, be patient, and focus on the task at hand, focus on the outcome I want. I am the one who is in control, if I let that control slip I'll just be in the same mindset I was before and that got me no where.

Disappear for 3-6 months,1,sxe374,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sxe374/disappear_for_36_months/,0,"Dear Redditors,

&#x200B;

I am currently 20 yo, living in the Netherlands, stopped going to school and I have an amazing job for my age.  I am still living with my mother and my brother, my dad passed away 3 years ago. We're living in a block of flats around 40m2 and the rent is fairly cheap, considering the prices in Netherlands. Everything looks great, except that there is one thing..

For people that have read ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"", which I am a big fan of, might understand my story a little bit better.Lately I feel like I'm trapped in so called ""Rat Race"" where you wake up at 6-7 am, go to work for 8-9 hours, after work you drive home, start eating, go to the gym and after gym it's like 8-9 pm and I have like 1-2 hours left to do something for myself. Looks like a normal life, but I started to notice this type of monotony and I feel like I am passing by my 20's very quickly, feels like we've just had New Year. I am earning good money, but I feel like I am not developing myself. It's like I am fallin for a bait where there is someone sitting on a pig, holding a stick with a carrot pinned on it and I am following it blindly. In my case, I am chasing a bill of money.

&#x200B;

 I have enough money to buy anything I would need on a daily basis. But living like this will keep me working for money forever. Once again, if you've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, you'd rather have money work for you. I'd rather chase that type of lifestyle where I don't have to care about the money for the remaining days of my life. Since I started working I feel like I don't have enough time to fully focus ony achieving my goals and dreams. It's also based on my situation home. Like I said, I am living with my brother and mother, on a 40m2 house, where my brother is unemployed (he's 23) and my mother is sick and can not work. Living in such a small house, where you can clearly hear the TV playing from another room, or even when my mother has a phone call, it doesn't allow me to use these 1-2 hours after gym efficiently.

&#x200B;

Lately I've been thinking so much about leaving my house for 3-6 months. Since these are your 20's, this is the best time to take risks. I don't have children, neither do I have big expenses, the only thing that is holding me back is my job. I have to be honest, I won't find anything better in whole Netherlands than this, without having any decent school degree. But I feel like I have to listen to my heart and start chasing my dreams. Every night before I go to sleep, I have this type of weird feeling where I waste my whole life working for someone else, without working on myself or on my own dreams. It's that type of feeling of becoming an average person having a 40hr week job, going to a party at weekends, getting drunk and then complaining about going to your work on Monday. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how many people here are convinced that going to school is a must-thing-to-do in life and that I should do this to get good degrees and get even more paid job. I am aiming really high when it comes to my goals in real life and I feel that I won't accomplish these goals by going to school. That's why I am considering to disappear for 3-6 months. By working for almost a year at my job, I've saved €10.000 euro and if I fully complete my plan, I can make €20.000 of it. I want to fly to another country where living (renting house, food etc.) is fairly cheap, where I don't know anyone and I can only depend on myself. All I will need is a house/room with silence, a desk and internet access. For all these 3-6 months, I will live as cheap as possible and study 12-15 hours a day all profitable topic that I have interest in. Like I mentioned earlier, I want to become independant when it comes to money, so most of these topics will be money related. Also, I want to self develop myself in a way of: reading books, meeting new people in completely new place, improve the way I talk with people, improve my vocabulary. I would like you to see this as a journey of a 20 yo boy where he finally can live the life he wants to live. As much as I love my family, I can not stand anymore someone telling me what to do and how to do it. I want to learn and discover all of this by myself. I really want to live the way I want to live and not how someone expects it. That's my feeling of need to disappear. 

&#x200B;

One of the places I've been considering going to is Azores, Portugal. Mostly because living there is fairly cheap, but I don't know about internet access over there. Anyone reading this, if you know places where you can live cheaply with decent internet access, please let me know. It would help me with my research of choosing the right place.

&#x200B;

The first thing I will do is talk with my Team Leader at my work. I don't want to leave my workplace without saying anything and I will also explain this story to him. Like I said, I have an amazing job and I think he'll understand my choice. I can also negotiate an option of eventually coming back without any issues, after these 3-6 months.

&#x200B;

 I was curious if there's anyone else who decided to go for such a journey in his life and how it ended. . Also, if there's anyone that has suggestions, tips, anything regarding my journey, feel free to let me know anything. I am still young and I feel like I am missing life experience, that's why I think that it could be one of the biggest challenges of my life.

What led to this? Possibly-

I'm getting rejected over and over again from job interviews since July. All my friends and batchmates have great offers, some even have multiple offers. I don't want to say this since I believe everything should work out in every person's favour to the point they lead a happy life, but even undeserving ones got a job either by pure luck or by cheating. Recently since this Valentine's day, I got rejected from 3 different companies in 3 consecutive days.

Then I opened Instagram and there I saw my friends and others posting pics with their girlfriend/boyfriend. Now my mind was already messed up and it added more thinking they have a job and a love life. I don't have any. Since I'm a hopeless romantic, I always wanted a romantic partner who loves me, but then I come to realize that I'm not that good looking and no one seems to be attracted to me. I want a family of my own in the future but I don't think I'll ever have one.

I have my own dreams and plan to study abroad after earning some money to fund my education but the point is I'm not getting a job.  I have my other plans as well.

Nothing seems to fall in my favour. I worked hard and prayed, nothing helps. At this point, I feel my body has entirely given up. Its just shutting down. Everyone's happy atleast in one aspect of their life but I don't have anything - no job, no love life, no good looks. 

Many times I've contemplated of suicide but that doesn't work for me as my optimistic side kicks in saying, ""what if something good happens in the future?"".

From Cardia to Cardi B: How I memorised the Human anatomy,10,swxrgf,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/swxrgf/from_cardia_to_cardi_b_how_i_memorised_the_human/,3,"I just wanted to share how I came from flunking a course in one year to placing in the top 5% of my cohort for Fundamentals of Anatomy.

### 1. Understand the origin of the name

What a lot of people don’t take advantage of is how most human body parts are derived from Greek and Latin. Back in those days, they used appearance and location to name each anatomical feature.

In Jim Kwik’s **Limitless**, he explores how people can better memorize others’ names. A simple example is the Baker/baker paradox. Let’s say there are 10 new people you’ve just met and learned the names, with one of them named Jane Baker. If you were to just focus on the name itself, there’s a high chance you’ll probably get the real Jane Baker wrong. Instead of just memorizing the name, what you should do is try visualizing her baking a cake. What this does is that you now have 2 touch points of memory: the name itself and a fake occupation. This principle should also be applied to anatomy, whereby the name's origin is based on position e.g. posterior=towards the back.

**Bonus:** If you’re an NBA fan, you can remember Posterior by relating it back to ‘Post-Up Play’ i.e. **Back** **to the basket**.

### 2. Relate it to your interests

By linking your learning to your outside interests, you’re more willing to understand the content. That’s exactly how I became bothered learning anatomy.

As an avid NBA fan, I often used pictures of notable figures in my learning. An example of this is how I remembered the parts of the sternum (chest bone). Two personnel that I linked the part to were David Stern (Former NBA commissioner) with the **Sternum** and Manu Ginobili (Former San Antonio Spurs) with **Manubrium.**

What this does for me is two things:

1. Since I’ve associated the sternum with NBA, it suggests there’s a component also linked to the NBA.
2. It adds another touchpoint to my memory.

### 3. Incorporate Humour

What makes fake news go viral is how it creates an emotional reaction. This principle can be tied to humor and memory. An example of how I made it work is thinking the Cardia was Cardi-B's cousin and for the Pelvis, I thought of Pelvis Presley.

I also used this principle with remembering the order of the inner ear: Vestibule, Saccule, and Cochlear by reminding me that the **Sack is always next to the cock.**

### 4. Involve more of your senses

To learn effectively, you need to expose yourself to different forms of content. What helped me solidify my understanding of human anatomy is trying to link it to as many senses that I can: touch, sight, listen.

***Disclaimer:*** *Do not smell or taste body parts*

Whenever I was learning a new component in gross anatomy, I would try to really listen to the word itself and notice where the lab demo was touching. I would mimic him/her by feeling the same components on my own body. This helped build another touchpoint. Whenever I revised the same material, I would do the same procedure and say the term out loud while flicking through my flashcards. With parts I struggled more with, I found that drawing and color-coding were quite useful.

***Disclaimer***: *Avoid touching your own privates in the middle of the exam. You may get some weird looks from your exam supervisors.*",1645350437.0

Think of it like a professional poker player, who would like to play a set pair of hands that give him the best chances of success, and folds everything else. Most players play for fun, will do wild calls and bets, but the pro's have their rules and stats; they don't really gamble, they abuse a disbalance in odds over and over again. 

That kind of job is extremely tedious and boring, but insanely profitable. However, I am stuck at the ""beginner"" level. I have my ""trick"" but I will see good cards and say ""ooh, I wonder how it will play out"" and enter regardless, essentially gambling like any other idiot at the table.

How to create an environment for productivity?,1,sxc5xo,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sxc5xo/how_to_create_an_environment_for_productivity/,0,"Recently we're hit by a strong typhoon that caused great devastation in our place. One of which is the long power outage that lasts for over a month. Before the typhoon hit my lifestyle was pretty much unproductive. I woke up, eat, work, surf the internet for countless hours (and even masturbate) until I exhausted myself and sleep which also caused me to not have enough sleep because I'm always keeping myself entertain with the internet. After the typhoon hit I've lost the ability to maintain the same lifestyle due to the lack of electricity. That's when I've discovered myself doing the things which I love but don't normally do such as reading books, working out, going outdoors and spending time with my family which I greatly enjoyed because maybe I don't really have much things to do or maybe because I don't really have a choice and that I'm forced to do those things to not bore myself? After the power have been restored in my place I find myself doing the things that I previously do before the typhoon hit. 

After some time I've realized that a sudden change of environment or situation that limits me from having access to things that I usually do resulted in me becoming more productive (or perhaps was forced to do other things to avoid boredom) due to the innate desire of my body to seek other activities as replacement to what I usually do. Now that everything's back to normal I feel that I'm trapped again and I really want to go back to working out, reading books and spending time with my family but I feel like the environment that I am in now is greatly keeping me or limiting me from doing them again (maybe because I'm addicted to the internet and because of it I'm procrastinating).

I want to come to terms with with my traumatic childhood but I don’t know how,2,sx6nfi,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sx6nfi/i_want_to_come_to_terms_with_with_my_traumatic/,2,"*This is a very long post, but honestly I don’t know how to condense all of my thoughts concisely because I feel like there’s so much weighing down on me at the moment. 

TL;DR - grew up in an abusive environment and never got to live a normal childhood, and it has severely affected the way I am today. 

[21M] As a child, my mom was so paranoid that I wasn’t allowed to step outside of the house unless she took me to school or my grandma’s house. I was never allowed to interact with other the kids in my school, and I spent my whole childhood indoors. 

She was also an extreme hoarder, and I have a lot of memories just walking around piles and piles of junk that she would buy and never use. Our bathtub was filled to the brim with clothes and there was even an unoccupied room dedicated to McDonald’s toys that she collected over the years and wouldn’t throw away because they held “sentimental value” to her. 

There are a lot of moments of physical abuse that are etched into my head. One time she started ripping out chunks of my sister’s hair because she was having trouble swallowing a pill. 

Another time when I was 9, my mom was beating me and my uncle had to pull her off. He then started to beat my mom brutally and threatened to kill her. I was trying to stop them as they were screaming at each other but my uncle tried stabbing her face with a pair of scissors. My grandparents were able to pull them apart but it caused a huge rift in my family, which my sisters and my mom constantly blamed me for. 

Everyone in my family saw her as a black sheep because she would act erratically and was overall a horrible person. 

I always wanted to go outside and play like all the other kids, but I never got to. I spent all of my free time watching YouTube, TV, or playing video games to compensate for my boredom. I I wasn’t even allowed to go to the library down the street to do homework, so I would do it in the bathroom and did it on the floor. I was a slob without even knowing because I assumed my environment was normal. I became addicted to the Internet when I was very young because it was one of the only things that put me at comfort. 

I was also bullied a lot in school. I didn’t know how to interact with others nor did I understand proper hygiene, and I was always seen as the really weird awkward kid that smelled bad and had dandruff. No one really wanted me around (understandably) and I was considered a loser up until I graduated high school. 

I always thought that life would be better by the time I grew older. However, I realized that I wasted my whole childhood doing nothing. Instead of taking action to study and work towards a better life, I literally spent my whole life lounging in gluttony. 

I remember my whole childhood like it was yesterday, because I still act like one. I watch old Disney Channel shows and commercials from 2010 because they were my only escape from the reality I lived in. I would imagine myself as the main characters of those shows because I wished I could live a life like theirs. I play my favorite Zelda and Kingdom Hearts games because they were my only source of happiness back then. I attached myself to a lot of past media I consumed, and now I’m constantly stuck in a loop trying to relive the happiest moments of my childhood through them. 

I’m in college now, but I’m a lazy piece of shit like my mom. My room is a mess, I lay in bed all day when I’m not in class, and I’m very emotionally unstable from all of the painful memories. I have vocal/motor tics that I can’t control every time I’m stressed or recall something traumatic. I used to hit myself a lot involuntarily and I have had a few suicide attempts in the last few years. 

The psychiatrist I talked to diagnosed me with CPTSD/Major Depression. A nurse practitioner also prescribed me meds for Tourette’s/ADD because of my tics and my trouble with learning, but I feel like those two are just an extension of the PTSD and depression. What sucks is that my mom tried so hard to get me off antidepressants even after my first suicide attempt. She said that there’s nothing wrong with me and that if there was, she would have known when I was a kid. The whole ride back from the NP she told me that a nurse isn’t qualified to distribute medication like that, and that they’re just trying to get me addicted. I can’t afford meds and therapy myself, so I’ve just been coping by trying to figure things out myself. 

I don’t have any friends and all I do nowadays is stay in my dorm, because that’s all I know how to do. I used to always want to go outside as a kid, but now I don’t even want to step out. I don’t even feel like a human anymore - I was so full of life as a kid, but now I’m just an emotionless hollow shell of what I used to be. 

I’ve tried so hard to take over my life again, but my past always haunts me. I wish there was some way I could go back in time and just fix everything I was doing wrong. I know that all I can do is move forward and make a better future for myself now, but honestly it all feels like bullshit because I don’t know if I’ll ever recover from everything that happened. 

What should I do to pick up the pieces and move on with my life?",1645378801.0

How do you learn to be consistent to a plan when you seem to crave chaos and novelty?,4,swzzzv,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/swzzzv/how_do_you_learn_to_be_consistent_to_a_plan_when/,2,"Self improvement seems to boil down to 

Deciding what you want > Find out what you have to become to achieve it > set up systems/ routines that will move you towards becoming that person > Consistently applying those routines to your life until you achieve it.

I can do the first three but the last one I am really bad at. I think (although I'm not sure) that maybe it's because having a plan or routine and just having to follow the process outlined completely eliminates any kind of interesting chaos or novelty from life. 

No matter what I do, how much I want something, or how much self discipline I try to apply I will always end up sabotaging myself and I will end up back in the unplanned routine-less state and stop making any progress. 

I want to be able to stick to a routine and I want to learn to be consistent but I find the novelty wears off so quickly and start to question why I'm doing it and it's as if the reason no longer has meaning to me. 

For example I could start a regular exercise routine (and have done many times) with the desire to get fitter and more healthy. Starting that will be novel and fun because I feel like I'm achieving something but eventually (often only a few weeks) that will wear off. The reality of having to put in the time for something consistently means no matter how much I initially liked it it will eventually lose it's appeal and I will stop.

It seems to me the key ingredient to success in achieving your goals really boils down to your ability to follow through on things as they become routine to the point of being boring. To be able to keep pushing through despite it no longer having the appeal it did because doing anything enough will take away what made it appealing to begin with.

"My 6 Month ""Dopamine Detox"" Story (15 - 16 Years Old)",30,swn1qt,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/swn1qt/my_6_month_dopamine_detox_story_15_16_years_old/,16," All over YouTube (and still today) I'd see videos telling you how you could 'reset your mind' in 24 hours or in 1 week, so I took it one step further at the age of 15 and went on a **6 month ""dopamine detox""** since August 1st 2021. Firstly, hi, my name is David and this post is to help anyone who's trying to better themselves and , in this case , think a dopamine detox can help them. So this is (the brief version of) my story.

**The first step was leaving social media**. Every time I refer to social media in this post I'm talking about TikTok, Twitter Instagram and Snapchat I already had a little experience in this, around the first time I left it was valentines day 2021. Although it may have been subconsciously linked to valentines day, my reason for leaving at that time was to just take a break, that lasted about 1 week. Quick advice for anyone trying to quit social media , the fact that you can even leave for 24 hours should impress you, thousands of technologists and scientists work day and night to make sure you stay glued to your screen.

The official ""detox"" started on the first of August 2021. At this point, I'd completely had enough of social media , it was terrible for my mental health, I'd be comparing myself to other people , I had 16 hour screen time and (like most young men) and (at 15) porn addiction. Week 1 was probably that hardest but most interesting. So I'll explain how you can , and exactly how I did.

Schedule your day. The first (and almost only step) you need for a dopamine detox is to make yourself a schedule. The point of it is to fill your day with good habits and make this DAY a habit. And before you ask, yes , things got in the way that made me busy, but even completing 50% of your schedule is better than the days you had without scheduling. My bad habits , binge social media , binge Netflix, and basically do nothing useful were all replaced.

**I planned my entire day , adding the new habits :**

Journaling

Reading books

Mediation

And studying to work on school (I was 15 so this was important).

This is the timetable that will change your life ( I literally used the notes app on ios) and I want everyone to try this out. Even writing this post , is scheduled into my day , labelled \[Help People on Reddit 18:00 - 18:30\]. When your whole day becomes a routine , you achieve your goals so much faster. How to maintain this for so long? Have 2 hours as part of your day , literally allocated to the bad habits (for now) you want to keep. I'd recommend Netflix or watching YouTube or playing games rather than watching porn and mindlessly surfing social media. I may not have explained the schedule properly so if you have any questions ,I'm sure me or anyone else who's tried this can answer this for you.

**Didn't I get bored?** At the start , yes. Being bored was a good thing honestly , I'd rather sit and talk to myself in my journal if I really have nothing to do, and this was much better than 'overstimulating my brain' on a video game for example. And this is why I have to emphasize , your reason WHY you do this , is so important. Dopamine detox isn't some 24 hour challenge. It's a lifestyle change. My reason why is to give my future self the best possible life because of the decisions I make today. The concept of 'Delayed Gratification'. I mean think about it , think about something your past self has done for you that you are grateful for, If you enjoy this feeling then ""dopamine detox"" is for you.

**Now the benefits:**

My screen time down from 16 hours to 3 hours (Don't compare your screen time to mine lol, as long as you're being mostly productive who cares), but personally, for me , I valued this.

I'm in the best shape I've ever been

My mental health is the best it's ever been, for those you living in the UK, the NHS has a mental health test that is a few questions long and gives you a score. I'd recommend everyone who can take this , take this .

I care a lot less about what people think of me , this comes with better mental health I'm guessing.

Drastically reduced bad habits , I say ""reduced"" because the attractive thing is to tell you I've eliminated these completely, Although I pretty much have , I'm here on reddit (social media) talking about it. Although now , I feel like its almost my purpose right now to inform and help as many people as I can from a younger perspective.

The positives heavily outweigh the negatives (if there are any). **I'd recommend this to anyone** and everyone. I apologise for the lack of detail in certain aspects of this. Especially , the schedule is easier understand if you can see the picture. I will be posting a YouTube video (Channel in my profile) on this topic and include more detail so feel free to check it out if you enjoyed hearing this story or you feel like it could benefit you , **I'd love to hear what you guys have to say** and what questions you have and suggestions as to what I could talk about further or in more detail. **I apologise in advice if you see this post multiple times** , it will be shared to a few subreddits to spread the message. You really read this whole thing , thank you have a nice day :)",1645313633.0

(Off course my family and friends where always there to support me.) 5 years later, I've managed to repair all the damage that child abuse brought on me. Yes, it was tough. But I live a good and healthy life now with my 8yo. I even managed to build a business with a stable income. I'm 33yo now.

Self help book recs for emotional and career improvement?,1,sx12nc,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sx12nc/self_help_book_recs_for_emotional_and_career/,2,"Hi, I'm very annoyed with myself [19M] and I seriously need to change. Can't afford therapy, so self help books should be the next best thing I guess. I'll list here a few issues that I'm dealing with, both on a personal and academic/professional level, and if anyone has any books tackling any of them, I would be very greatful if they could give me a recommendation.

Personal:
- passivity in relationships 
- lack of assertiveness
- communication issues (difficulty in opening up, in establishing boundaries)
- difficulty being my own person
- emotional burn out
- how to make it clear that I care about other people
- assume responsibility/my own faults
- self doubt and overall low self esteem (masked as slight confidence but underneath I feel like I'm crumbling lmfao)

Professional:
- how to be more disciplined
- sticking to long term goals and not jumping from project to project
- realising my true value, tackling impostor syndrome tendencies 

That's about it (or at least what's affecting my life the most right now). I'm asking here because if someone gives me even one single book suggestion, I can't keep finding excuses of 'ohhh noooo I have zero guidance and don't know what to do now that I'm dealing with the same problem for the 50th time'. I'm tired of making ammends and then not respecting any of them. I don't want to be a secluded guy because I have issues communicating.

However, if your goal is to lose 5 kilos and you've successfully lost your first 2 kilos, it is probably not helpful to reward yourself with the largest pizza you've ever eaten.

I don't want to be faking the things i do just to appear ""good"" and want them to be heartfelt. I get certain thoughts which I know are bad, and I'm ashamed of myself for thinking that way.

For example, a friend of mine asked me to check for courses with his major in the same universities i was looking for. Though I told him yes, i secretly thought that he'd never be able to make it to the colleges i was opting for because he was not a top ranking guy. I felt horrible immediately after that and was ashamed of myself.

Another example is when i felt jealous of a friend when i read somewhere that her career choice pays more than my choice of career.

Unsolicited criticism,2,swvzd8,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/swvzd8/unsolicited_criticism/,1,"Some background: I’ve been learning another language and it’s been quite fun. I enjoy watching tv or Netflix in this language, speaking it with my significant other who is also learning it. We are essentially fluent although there are different degrees of fluency. We have been discussing lately how we can work on our accent. I take constructive criticism often from my significant other. I have made a marked improvement in my accent, but yes, it’s still not perfect. I’m working on it. However, I have been feeling extremely down lately about the language. The second they recognize that I’m a foreigner, they switch to English. So I often speak this language with non-native speakers.

Main issue: so I went out with a friend a few weeks ago who is a native speaker. And at dinner, I said one word while ordering to the waiter. And she was like oh wow, you said that word good! So when people ask you „what’s the ONE WORD you can say in the language, you can tell them that word hahaha“. I wanted to slap her. I am in a C1 course and have been particularly focusing on my accent. We also had a whole 5 hour conversation in the language the week before so no, I can say more than one word correctly, thank you.

And then came last night. After a few beers, my other friend and I started speaking the language, although both of us are not native speakers. And he started talking about how he can hear my accent. It just really brings me down because I know. I am working on it but it’s not so god awful. And my friend also has an accent. I actually got a compliment before as well and I am being realistic but I definitely have a much much lighter accent than most people who come from my country. But the fact that native speakers switch to English and all the unsolicited advice makes me upset. Especially when after switching to english, I often have to translate a word for the other person because my level is higher in their language than theirs is in english. I’m just really down

Im not worried if I’ll ever be perfect. I got to this level from no knowledge of the language in 2 years. I can definitely get there. The problem is that all the people are so annoying about it that I don’t know if it’s worth it. Why should I put so much effort in when they are so hypocritical?",1645343332.0

I should have never gone to college, my mom pressured me into it. I was already mad depressed going in but mom didnt want a kid who wasnt going to college.

I left for college 6 years ago and spent the next three years just wasting time. Just destroying my body with drugs and alcohol. Barely making it by with grades. Eventually I regressed to full blown hermit. Wake up, skip class, smoke weed, watch tv, and day dream about a truck driving through my window and hurting me so bad people will forgive how much of a fuck up i am. 

Eventually I switched schools, repeated the process until I found myself a wonderful gf and dropped out. Ive been busting my ass ever since, trying to be better to myself and better for her. But no one really gives a shit. Sometimes i dont think she cares either. 

Ive been trying to force myself to be proud of myself. 

I’m back in college, about to graduate with a 2.7gpa. 

I quit caffeine, no more twice daily energy drink since 6th grade. 

Started drinking water, not a habit ive ever had, I honestly dont know how im alive. Legit would avoid water most of my life. 

Quit nicotine. Been smoking daily since 14. Started vaping at around age 20. Havent had a cig in 6 months, havent vaped in a week. 

I move around more now. Not quite working out, but I get up and do a thing everyday now. 

No more daily or twice daily take out. I eat decent, mostly salmon/chicken/ or eggs with fruits or veggies. 

Ive been getting better at eating proper amounts at proper times as well. No longer binge eating at night. 

Theres just so much more going on… all I want to do is cry and go back to my isolated room and get high. I want a fucking cig. I want someone to tell me they love me and mean it. I want some one to be proud of me. I want to feel prideful.",1645223760.0

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

From about age 7-13 everyone around me told me how great I was and medals and awards for spelling bee, piano competitions, robotics, etc. came easily. It all screwed up my perspective to where for the past few years if I didn't immediately get good at and praised for anything I felt like I was failing. 

This has basically led me to hate myself for never being able to live up to those standards I set for myself as a kid again. I'm now realizing that it's probably a desperate effort to motivate myself somehow, and it has worked, I made state in swimming after 4 years, I got through a lot of mental problems on my own, I got into community college early, and am going to graduate in December. All great stuff but I don't feel joy from doing it, because in order for my only source of motivation to work I have to repeatedly tell myself that I'm not good enough, making true victory practically impossible. I'm not planning on giving up, I'm going to get a job, move out, (hopefully) find a boyfriend, but I'm just worried that I won't be able to enjoy any of it.

I never really had any friends so I mainly talked to the people I was around the most - my family. Unfortunately, talking with them made me feel very smart because of the things that they said and their opinions. The debates with them included racism, homophobia, no respect for personal boundaries, arguing if you had a different opinion, no listening to what others had to say etc. 

I also had good grades, many achievements at my age, the only one out of the three kids in the gifted kids programm, so you know, my ego was definitely big. But my confidence and love for myself wasn't at all, which is what probably helped me realise how dumb I actually was/am. So much ""knowledge"" somewhere apparently, but I still don't appreciate and love myself. Hm, interesting. Also, I was raised to put more worth on the opinions of others than being truly educated about the world, be curious, healthy, care about yourself etc.  Not what my family was about. 

It wasn't until I came to college where I realised that I probably have to be one of the dumbest people ever. I don't know anything, all the good grades were just good grades, but nothing stayed in my head, my opinions about the world and people are very open minded, but I can't put into words what I think and what my morals are, I question my every thought - if it's from the mentality that I was raised in or if that's my opinion now.

What kind of broken do you want to be?,3,sw9u5b,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sw9u5b/what_kind_of_broken_do_you_want_to_be/,2,"Do you wish you were doing better at work? Maybe you wish you were making time to workout regularly? Or more calls back home to Mom, or more walks with your dog at the park? More time reading that book you keep wanting to get to? Tell me what parts of you that you wish were different.

At the end of the day, you have to choose what kind of broken you want to be. You can’t be the perfect employee and the perfect spouse and the perfect fitness guru and the perfect journaler. You don’t have time to do it all. No one does. And I’m tired of feeling like a failure because I can’t do all the things I want to do. I have so many goals and so many things I want to improve on, but I only have so much time. I’ve read all the efficiency books and tried all the scheduling hacks and my planner still only has 24 hours each day. Something has to give.

The most bitter part of this is that logically I know it doesn’t matter. I’ve missed goals before and no one yelled at me. I got another shot and I tried again and life moved on. I was the only one yelling at myself anyway, no one else was holding me to the insane standards I asked of myself. And yet I do it over and over again. It’s the worst merry-go-round that I can’t exit.

Any sane person could tell you that you’re not a failure just because you missed 1 out of 10 of your goals. That’s not how life works. You’re not either a success or a failure. You’re just a human and you feel good when you make progress and you feel gross when you’re stagnant. And that’s why I’m trying to reframe this for myself. I can pick what my most important goal is, I can put most of my time towards that, but there just isn’t enough of me to do every single thing I want to do. You have to be okay with letting some things go. Because some things will always slip through the cracks, and either you accept that as reality or you blame yourself for things that aren’t your fault. Clearly the latter doesn’t do anyone any favors.

So if you’re at the end of a long week and you did the best you could, I’m talking to you. If you had to put out a big fire in your life and you couldn’t accomplish anything else, I’m talking to you. If the only thing you succeeded in today was deciding to stay alive and it took everything you had, I’m talking to you.

You made the right choice, and I’m glad you did.

We just can’t do it all. We cannot fix everything and we cannot live up to every dream we have for ourselves. We just have to do the best we can on the most important stuff and try again tomorrow. You have to choose what is priority 1 and what is everything else. It’s okay to feel broken on priorities 2-999. They can wait for tomorrow. You only have one of you and it’s not your fault that the best you can do is one thing at a time. 

Are you actually broken? Of course not. But it probably feels like it, and that’s what it means to be a human in the 21st century. There’s so much expected of us and so many things ask for our time and attention. We can only do so much. So have some compassion for yourself when your tank reaches empty. You were never broken, there’s just some work that will have to wait for tomorrow.

Alone,21,sw0624,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sw0624/alone/,2,"Being alone with your mind can be the most suffocating thing in the world sometimes. Especially if you don't have a healthy relationship with yourself, because your natural mind -- that is the state of your mind without any external stimuli, whether it be your phone or being with friends or simply looking out the window -- can be ruthless to yourself and for some people be a threat to their lives.

*COMMON SENSE: If you talk to yourself negatively, you'll feel negative.* 

So logically... you stop talking negatively to yourself. Except all your thoughts, the good, the bad and the ugly ones, arise without your permission. You don't choose to have specific thoughts they simply just appear in your mind, so its near damn impossible to not talk shit all the time when you don't even know you are. 

This is where ""This is Water"", the iconic commencement speech by David Foster Wallace (I highly recommend you listen to it if you haven't yet)  makes one of the most important points of all time. Its not his own point or even a new point, **its a point that has been known by humans for thousands of years**... but like all things that stay around for a few generations, the point was labelled as a ""tradition"".  A few generations later and it was labelled as ""old dead people trying to control you after death"". 

*The point* is that what your mind does when its alone is the most important foundation for how you live and feel. That fixing it takes repetition, dedication and devotion to have some form of control over your mind. 

Its mainly why Christians have daily devotion where they read the bible all the time, or why Muslims pray five times a day, or why Buddhist meditate for hours a day. Its why religious people are statistically happy.

Now I'm not saying we should become religious (I am an avid adversary of dogmatic religious belief) but we need to incorporate the same dedication and devotion towards controlling our natural mind. Because to not do so is to be slave to your own mind, to have all your freedom stripped away and not even realize it.

Observations of a Master at Work,2,swckpk,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/swckpk/observations_of_a_master_at_work/,0,"  

For the sake of context, I am an 18-year-old male. For most, it would be a red flag to listen to the self-improvement tips of a youngster, but I believe that the most beneficial advice comes from those who suffered but learned to defeat the pain on their own regardless their age. I don’t know if what I had was the medical depression or some other type of rut, but it was surely painful, especially that the shitty situations I was going through were out of my control: Death of some very close people, parents’ bankruptcy, parents’ divorce, and backstabbing from close people. I got out of the trap and here are my observations: 

1. I was either locked up in the shitty things of the past or future. I couldn’t plant myself in the present, and a very wise person gave me the “secret formula” which transformed my life.

2. Overthinking the shit out of every situation because of trust issues was another demon in my life. 

3. Anger issues (demon #2) because I was trying to become the better person but everything happening in my life was going against this cause.

4. There’s no “using phone for 1-2 hours only”. It’s either full dopamine detoxing or full-on phone addiction.

5. Every piece of content I consumed while on Instagram, Tik Tok, or YouTube reminded me of the shitty things that happened in the past, got me frightened of the near future, or resentful of the present. Hence, FUCK SOCIAL MEDIA.

6. Not having a “close friends” circle destroyed me. Loneliness is the fucking enemy.

7. There was a sort of inconsistency between what I viewed myself and what others viewed me. The love and respect of people only comes from acting in an unfiltered manner. Be yourself. 

8. Daydreaming is another enemy. 

Sometimes, the self-improvement journey isn’t about improving your own mistakes. In my case, this journey was about killing the pain I felt after every shitty thing that happened. When the world chokes the living shit out of you, you either surrender or you start the journey. A journey where you build a new and stronger version of yourself. The secret formula is a set of baby steps a very close person gave me. These are the steps that nurture the warrior in you. The steps that teach you discipline, persistence, consistency, and patience. ""Do not pray for easy lives, pray to be stronger men."" \~ John F. Kennedy. The lifestyle this person taught me toughened me up gravely. Shit still happens, but I’m no longer a pussy.

Professionally, I have a bachelor's in Engineering and have worked in the social service sector for the past decade. I have been working in a field that is common practice in the developed world but is virtually unheard of in my country. I have persevered till now as I thought that I would be part of positive change in my country. Now, I have realised that the ""road less traveled"" is so because that road is rough and can throw you off a cliff anytime. I am at the edge of the cliff and am mentally exhausted. Meanwhile, my peers who took the highway are miles ahead of me and are enjoying themselves.

Personally, there is nothing much to mention. I believe I have mild autism (possibly Aspergers). I have a hard time understanding social signals, cannot understand sarcasm, and find it difficult to maintain eye contact. Romantic and sexual experience is zero. No friends to talk to. I hang out with a group that is nice to me but I know that I am the outcast, lowest on the group hierarchy. 

For the past year, I have been consumed by self-hatred and envy. I am tired of it now. I want to wipe the last 30 years of my life and start again. If there was a way, I would have loved to wipe my memory too. Too much pain and regret.

How to pick what to do in your free time,61,svrlee,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/svrlee/how_to_pick_what_to_do_in_your_free_time/,2," A common question I see online is “how do I pick what to do with my free time?”

We’re so bombarded with the benefits of certain hobbies or lifestyle habits that sometimes it’s hard to know where to put our energy. 

Tell me if this sounds familiar:

You’re a young male with an interest in self-improvement, you get waves of intense motivation where you commit yourself to waking  up at 5am, taking a cold shower, going for a run and then studying for an hour only to hit the gym, meditate and learn Spanish in the evening before working  on your side hustle. 

And maybe you’re able to maintain a routine like that for a few days, but eventually the motivation runs dry and you’re back to jacking off to reddit porn at 11am on a Saturday. 

And you’ve probably come to the conclusion that you need to streamline your commitments and focus on a few things at a time. But you keep finding that as soon as you begin a new habit, your attention and enthusiasm is distracted by a different, potentially more beneficial habit so you switch to doing that one instead.

If you’ve resonated with what I’ve said there then great, this post is going to help you figure out the habits and hobbies that’ll benefit you the most and you can actually stick to. 

We’re going to start by asking ourselves a few questions to establish your WHY and your WHATS: 

Firstly, **why do you need something to work on?** I’m serious,  working towards goals, habits and learning things is hard and uncomfortable. **Why are you willing to put yourself through that discomfort?** What is it you are hoping to achieve by learning/practicing/habitualising these things? Do you want to make yourself more employable? Do you want to be more well-rounded? More knowledgeable? Healthier? Do you just want the sense of achievement when you complete a goal? Are you looking for a new hobby? Do you want to be more disciplined?

Answering these questions will give you your **WHY.**

A lot of people will start trying to implement new habits without a WHY or they hope they’ll find the WHY along the way. If you’re expecting yourself to get in a cold shower every morning you better have a good reason for it. When you’re unmotivated, reminding yourself of this WHY will be the thing that gets you to the gym.

Once you know your WHY, your WHAT should become clear. You want to become more employable in the field of tech (the WHY) so you want to learn to code (the WHAT). You want to be more attractive to girls (WHY) so you want to go to the gym (WHAT).

The next step is the one you’ve probably missed in the past, and it’s the reason you find yourself over committing yourself to goals or failing within the first few weeks. 

Any goal/habit comes with sacrifice and suffering. To achieve your goal you are going to need to sacrifice your free time, and you are going to need to suffer discomfort through the process. And that’s literally any goal. Want to be a famous youtuber? You’re going to need to sacrifice a hell of a lot of free time making and perfecting videos, and you’re going to need to suffer making shit videos that no one wants to watch.

Want to invest in stocks? You’ll need to sacrifice your disposable income, your time and you’re going to need to suffer the uncertainty of not knowing if your stocks are going to go up or down.

So once you’ve got your WHY and your WHAT you need to think

Is it worth the suffering and sacrifice?

I’ll give you an example:

I would love to play the piano, I think it’s a beautiful instrument, I think playing it would be relaxing and rewarding and it seems kinda fun.  

But I am not willing to sacrifice the hours it’ll take to learn, I'm aware that once I understand the basics it'd be more fun and creative, however I’m not willing to make scales and drills a daily part of my life and I'm not willing to pay money for lessons. To me the sacrifices aren’t worth the rewards.

Another example: I want to be in good shape, it's important to me to be physically fit and also to look good shirtless. To achieve this I AM willing to sacrifice sweaty hours in the gym, week after week. I AM willing to count my calories and avoid junk food. I AM willing to pay for gym memberships and running shoes and I AM willing to wake up early and exercise. To me the sacrifice is worth the reward.

To reach your goal you're going to have to sacrifice your free time, and you are going to need to suffer discomfort. Is your WHY worth this? Only you can decide.

How do you get over pass regrets so they wont affect you now?,3,sw961x,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sw961x/how_do_you_get_over_pass_regrets_so_they_wont/,3,"Im 29 just turn a couple months back. Im greatful for what i have and accomplished. I tell myself things happen for a reason that i will never know for. 

The regrets are 

1. Not buying a house in 18,19,20, etc it wasn't for the lack of  trying but self doubt and fear. I feel ashamed because i spend years etc saving and planning for the moment just to chicken out. I cant stand looking at myself as i was 25 and would of been so far ahead of the game.

In high school i was alone and felt like a C student someone who didnt have group but kept on going to new groups hopping along. 

I wanted to be the best out of everyone i went to highschool with or just to prove that im someone by making it. 

From 2017 to now. Real estate not buying even when i was preapproved have the funds etc and not buy or got offered beaten was downing me out. 

I regret not building a friendship with people or never being in a realtionship. Im not the best looking guy but a solid 7 

I had a shot to buy tesla shares 10k worth but i cancel it last minute and now 4 years later worth 150k. I had a job interview with pzifer the drug company in 19 right before the pandemic but miss the interview being late. 

I felt like i had everything i needed lined up in my life perfectly like God was blessing me big time and feel like i failed him and myself.

i slowly realised that if you don’t change your mindset, you’ll always fall back into your old habits because there’s no foundation there to begin with. 

these past few days i’ve been working hard to change my mindset and be kind to myself as silly. and as it sounds this stuff works wonders. instead of bombarding myself with a whole new routine i’m gradually introducing and swapping out habits for better ones and that’s so beneficial.

it sounds so obvious but it’s hard to actually realise change comes from within. there’s a huge difference between wanting to change and acting on it, it has to start internally. additionally, it’s a process! i used to be convinced that change had to happen overnight otherwise i failed, it doesn’t! at all.",1645272744.0

I've never made any horrendous choices. I've always stayed in shape and eaten well. I've had good hobbies which have resulted in fulfilment and even jobs opportunities. I have friends, have had relationships, a good social life, a good family relationship. I'd say my only vices have been drinking and smoking, and as a guy who's just come out of his early twenties, who hasn't? I just enjoyed going out. And I don't regret any of it. 

However, all my life I haven't been able to shake certain feelings. Whether they're true or not, they have haunted me forever. I feel weak, I was bullied in my early years and teens, I struggle to stand up for myself or others, I fall into spirals of pessimism and self pity. I obsess over stupid things. I still feel, very much, like a child. I don't think that any external changes will fix  this. I've taken the self improvement meme to its extremes. And, at the base of it all, I feel that everything is completely pointless. I don't care enough about money or materialism to be career driven. I don't look forward to getting married or raising a family enough to believe that I will achieve fulfilment from that. My job, although rewarding, is extremely taxing emotionally and physically (high school teacher). And my self esteem often comes in the way of  my teaching. I get thoughts like 'some drunk guy called me a prick on the weekend and I didn't retaliate. How could I possibly stand in front of these children and pretend I have any self respect?'. I am unable to buy the narratives that come with organised religion (although I appreciate their teachings), and I was raised religious so I rebelled against that in my teenage years. End of the day, I don't believe there is an endpoint that I will achieve that will make life enjoyable. There is no amount of money, no fitness level, no relationship good enough that will afford me the happiness that I seek. I have never overcome this crippling self esteem and existential dread, and I don't know if I ever will.

It got to the point where I sometimes got thoughts that  I'd be better off dead just so I could stop feeling like such a useless man. I'm not suicidal but it certainly made the idea more appealing. What I want to know is: what do you do when you feel like you've exhausted all your options? I think I may simply just be too highly neurotic.

I’ve always been behind everyone else when it came to school and I always felt very dumb. I did so bad in school as a kid that they tried to put me in remedial classes. 

I don’t really enjoy learning and I’ve never really been a curious person. I just do things because I’m supposed to or if I want to impress others. In my free time, I usually spend hours walking around in a circle in my room, stuck on the same thought loop talking to myself without even realizing. My thoughts jump erratically, to the point where I’ll have 3 songs playing in my head at once. 

I’m trying to learn the fundamentals of jazz piano and how to use certain programs for music production/animation, but after 10 minutes of trying to learn something I get really impatient and go back to staring at the wall. 

I’ve tried writing down every time I get distracted throughout the day and what I was thinking about, but it hasn’t really changed my work ethic. 

Even when I try to get a head start on work or put away my distractions, my brain doesn’t start to work until the very last minute. I’m very inefficient and nothing really starts to click until it’s time to crunch. It’s so bad that I starved for 2 days because I was too lazy to get groceries. 

What’s even worse is that my professors and counselors praise me for getting straight A’s. They treat me like I’m gifted and advanced in my field when I’m really just a dumb kid that’s scared of getting yelled at for not doing their chores. I hate that I’m being rewarded for my laziness. 

I’ve been prescribed meds for tourette’s/ADD but I never took them because my parents never believed there was something wrong with me. What sucks is that I can’t afford them myself. 

I have been trying to meditate to compensate for no meds and have gotten better at it, but I feel like I’m just polishing the piece of shit that’s my brain. I also have checklists and work out sometimes, but I never complete them (even if my goals are very simple).

Sometimes I feel like I’m doomed to be this way because I don’t seem to care about anything enough to sit down and learn for a few hours every day.

I grew up with an incredibly judgmental mother and sister, so I was kind of raised to think in this way. But I want to change.

My roommate recently pointed out to me that I’m very judgmental and always hating on people. Which, after some introspection, I feel is true. I have been very vocal about how much I don’t like certain traits about certain people. 

I get really irritated when people are careless, rude, or lack common sense, and I often tell my roommate about these situations. For example, one of my friends only puts others down as his sense of humor and brags about being rude to girls he takes out on dates. Another lets others clean up during group dinners and sits there on his phone, not helping with cleanup at all. Stuff like this irritates me a lot, and then I can’t stop thinking about stuff I want to say to them to realize how selfish/rude they are being. But I feel like stuff like this are legitimate things that I’m calling out. 

Other things though I feel are very bitchy of me to be thinking. For example, a friend who I hardly hung out with texted me months later and basically said to my roommate “why is she reaching out to me again, she sounds so desperate for friends”.

You are Antifragile,6,sw2bey,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sw2bey/you_are_antifragile/,0,"The Hormesis Theory of Wellness

“That which does not kill us maker us stronger.” Friedrich Nietzsche

A cliche, but more true than you think.

&#x200B;

Objects are fragile

Most man-made things are fragile. The more stress you put on then, the less they last until they break.

The more miles on a car, the higher chance of failure. From one point it's so degraded, it's not worth repairing.

The same applies to all objects with mechanical moving parts: a bike, a drawer, a mechanical clock and so on. Objects with fewer mechanical moving parts, which are more electronic, last longer. An electric car usually lasts longer than a fossil-fuel car. But they still degrade the more stress you put on them.

A Tesla will break down without repair and maintenance. All buildings will eventually crumble without repairs. The chair or bed on which you are sitting now will break.

Man-made systems all break down with use. A road network can take only so much traffic until it becomes so congested that it stops completely. A hard-drive can take a limited number of writing and erasing.

Some objects are more fragile, some are are more resistant. But they all become more frail from exposure to stressors.

The natural world is different.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Living organisms are antifragile

Small stresses do not degrade then, they trigger adaptations. Living organisms become stronger to better handle these stresses in the future.

The easiest example is strength training. The more you lift, the stronger you become.

When you have muscle soreness, it is because the exercise killed cells in those muscles. The pain is from the inflammation created by this damage.

In response, your body produces new muscle cells and strengthens the existing ones (through more numerous and efficient mitochondria).

Next time you do the movement that caused soreness, your muscles will be more capable of it. They have adapted to it. They have grown stronger.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The mechanism of antifragility is hormesis

Hormesis refers to adaptive responses of biological systems to moderate environmental or self-imposed challenges through which the system improves its functionality and/or tolerance to more severe challenges. - Nature

When your muscles suffer from exercise, and then grow stronger, that is hormesis.

Hormesis is not just about muscles. All systems in the body have varying degrees of adaptability. Runners' bones get stronger. Cardiovascular training makes the heart stronger. Eating small amounts of poison creates (limited) resistance to that poison. Stretching increases mobility.

Hormesis is not only about the body, but the mind and the ""heart"" as well.

School and learning are stressors. In the right dose they lead to new skills and knowledge. Your mind adapts and becomes better at those cognitive tasks.

This adaptation is not so different from muscles growing better at an exercise. Your brain grows new connections between neurons and recruits new neurons when it learns a skill.

In emotions we are antifragile.

""That which does not kill us makes us stronger.""refers mainly to events that trigger negative emotions.

Subject yourself to a specific emotional stress and it will become less stressful.

People doing extreme feats, like solo climber Alex Honold, show how far this adaptation can go. Neuroimaging shows he feels very little fear for many situations related to climbing that would make you and I tremble.

Hormesis is limited. The dose makes the poison.

If you break your leg, it does not repair stronger the next day. If you go through too much trauma at once you might remain emotionally crippled. A full dose of deadly poison will kill you, not make you more resistant to that poison.

Hormesis happens when the stressor is small enough act to cause permanent damage, but large enough to signal adaptation.

Too much damage can overwhelm you ability to adapt and cause damage. But if you take it gradually big changes are possible.

Nobody goes from no-running to running ultra-marathons for example. But almost anybody can train up to running ultramarathons if they take it slow and gradual over years. The more they subject the body to the stress of running, the stronger the body becomes.

This antifragility is not by chance.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The evolutionary reason for antifragility

Natural selection.

In the natural world every living is in a competition to pass on its genes. This is achieved through survival, reproduction and the reproduction of offspring. Those who fare better make offspring that are more like them and so the trait proliferate. Those who fare worse die off and their traits disappear.

Antifragility is a key trait for evolutionary fitness.

It is a shifting, dynamic world. The planet changes. The environment changes.

All the organisms change. They evolve to increase their evolutionary fitness for their environment.

If we were like man-made objects, this constant change would be awful for us. Fragile systems have a limited range in which they can function well. Take them outside of this range and they break down quickly.

Antifragile systems grow stronger in change. They fare great at natural selection.

Humans are antifragile because otherwise they would not have survived. But this antifragility has a cost.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The cost of antifragility

An antifragile system thrives under adversity. It degrades under the absence of adversity.

Without the stimulation of the right kind of stress, the human body and mind decay.

If I push myself too hard, it is bad. But if I don’t push myself enough, it is also bad.

Comfort is our enemy.

We are suffering a worldwide epidemic of comfort damage.

A couch potato develops many health problems, including depression and death. Lying in bed feels great, but bedridden patients quickly atrophy and die without extensive medical procedures. Astronauts workout extensively to try to compensate for the absence of the stress of gravity.

It’s not just about physical stress. The largest longevity research, the Telmar study, found that a life of hedonistic leisure is shorter than one of working towards a difficult goal with challenges and risks.

Some of the unhappiest people are those who achieved their goals and have no more challenges to overcome. The brain produces new neurons daily but without cognitive effort that needs then, they die. Existing neural connections fade away if unused.

Humans thrive in pain.

Without the pain of dealing with something that is hard and challenging, we wither away.

Much of modern society is about making life as painless and comfortable as possible. This feels good in the moment, but makes us weak and frail. It makes our lives shorter and more miserable.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Solution: the right kind of discomfort

The solution is simple.

Bring back adversity, pain. The antifragile human body and mind will adapt and thrive.

Much of the ideal life I believe comes from deliberate discomfort.

Physical exercise is a pain. It’s unpleasant and difficult.

It’s also an elixir of youth. It prolongs life and improves its quality in all dimensions.

Confronting unknown challenges keeps your mind sharp and your body healthy. It allows new neurons to thrive instead of withering away. It makes you strong and supple. It hones skills. It makes you adaptable and balanced. It prevents anxiety and depression. It gives you energy.

What can you do?

Look at your life. Be honest. How easy is your life?

Is all the crap you complain about really a problem? Or is it of little consequence?

If you don’t have any real adversity and unknown challenges, find them.

Do right now

Think of something uncomfortable you can do in the next five days.

Examples. Try a sports feat that feels really hard or even impossible. Have a difficult conversation that you have been avoiding. Fast for 24 hours. Live without a smartphone or computer for 24 hours. Talk to a stranger. Attempt a new skill. Do something risky.

Then do it.

Seek pain to live well.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Addendum: masochism

A fun corollary from this idea is that masochism might have evolutionary value. I refer to the general term of masochism: deriving pleasure from pain, not the sexual connotation specifically.

Seeking pain would often create hormesis and thus be a beneficial behaviour for an antifragile system.

They say long distance runners or cyclists or cross fitters are masochists. This is an euphemism.

But maybe it's true. There is a special kind of pleasure in the pain of hard exercise. The activity itself is beneficial so maybe the masochism is as well. Maybe other types of masochism also led to beneficial hormesis.

I sucked at maths one year ago,5,sw0sb4,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sw0sb4/i_sucked_at_maths_one_year_ago/,4,"They place a high emphasis on teaching children mathematics in post-soviet countries. And, as a citizen of one of such countries, I was doomed.

I had no trouble understanding mathematics at first. I didn’t need to cheat or devote time to solving problems at home during the first six years of my education.

In the seventh grade, the situation took a sharp turn. My mother left the house. I managed to get sick eight times in an entire year. I lost a lot of weight and refused to eat anything. Whenever a teacher noticed me, he/she was bound to come up to me and ask me:

\- Is everything all right? You look really pale.

There was a constant feeling of hollowness in the area of the solar plexus. It was horrible, and I had a huge temptation to tighten a noose around my neck.

As you can imagine, studying and doing my homework were the last things on my mind. So, to combat my lack of knowledge, I started cheating. Although my grades improved, my knowledge did not. 

Once I got out of that psychological rut, I had no desire to sit down and catch up on what I didn’t know. The new habit of constant cheating had been formed.

# 9th grade

Everything changed in the 9th grade. I knew I had to do something.

You see, the Russian education system doesn’t consist of 12 grades like in the USA and some of the Western countries. We study for 11 years and only then are we allowed to apply to university or college.

The thing is, that isn’t the only option. You can leave after the 9th grade. The catch is, you can’t apply to university, only college. Additionally, the degree you get will be inferior to the one you get after completing 11 grades.

Therefore, we need to pass exams after the 9th and 11th grades to prove that we have learned something at school. 

Cheating is difficult and practically impossible during the 11th-grade examination (some manage to cheat during the 9th-grade examination, though).

Despite cheating my way through middle school, I wasn’t good at it. I got caught pretty frequently. The reason my marks weren’t plummeting was that teachers often turned a blind eye to me (out of respect). While everybody was talking, arguing, or trying to have fun, I quietly sat there and pretended to listen. 

I had one option left: to actually sit down at the desk and study.

# The beginning of my journey

Oh, how exasperating and tiring it was! I didn’t know literally anything. I even forgot how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. Damn fractions!

Here’s what I did.

I downloaded PhotoMath (one of the most wonderful apps I have ever seen), opened the textbook on the topic we were currently studying and started solving problems. Whenever I couldn’t comprehend something for more than 10 minutes, I opened the app and used it to guide me.

Photomath is an app that can solve mathematical problems for you. You only need to photograph an equation, and its algorithms will give you the answer. It can even show you step-by-step solutions and construct graphs.

In the beginning, I couldn’t leave the bloody app because I didn’t understand a thing. So, I retraced my steps.

\- Why do I not understand this topic?

\- Well, first of all, because I don’t know how to perform basic operations with fractions. I don’t know what a quadratic equation means. I have no idea what parabola, hyperbola, and linear function are.

Mathematics builds upon itself. If you don’t understand something, chances are you’ve missed some essential piece of the puzzle. By using this incredible capability of Photomath to display step-by-step solutions, I could point out the stuff I didn’t understand.

To say that it was frustrating would be an understatement. I can still remember banging on the desk or the wall beside the desk because my brain refused to concentrate. My ego was hurt because my grades took a dip. It looked like I wasn’t making any progress.

I persisted, though, and managed to excel at my examination.

# Where am I now with this approach?

I do not claim to be a mathematics expert. I can bet that most people reading this post know it better than I do (considering that you have finished high school and college). But I don’t compare myself to you, geniuses. 

It’s kind of bizarre that one and half years ago, I didn’t know what linear equations meant, how to perform basic operations with fractions and square roots, what is an absolute value, how to combine like terms, etc.

Two months ago, I covered most of the trigonometry, and now I’m moving onto derivatives (damn, that sounds scary). 

I feel proud of my progress, especially considering I didn’t sacrifice much for it. I haven’t stopped hanging out with my friends, learning English, reading books, watching TV shows or playing video games. I only carved out 1 hour a day for mathematics and chopped at that tree for 400 days straight.

This approach has worked for me.

# Crucial tips

**Solve as many problems as you can**

Maths isn’t history, biology, English literature, or a foreign language.

To excel at those subjects, you must immerse yourself in them, read a lot, and memorise.

However, mathematics doesn’t work that way. You can’t call yourself competent at a particular topic simply by reading about it in your textbook. You have to take action. 

**Be consistent**

Is there a point in studying 5-10 hours a day for a fortnight and then quitting?

1. I can guarantee that your learning time wasn’t as efficient as it could be. For example, I struggle to keep my attention sharp for longer than one hour. After that, my mind begins to wander frequently, and I find myself staring at the screen or the notebook, thinking about nothing.
2. That is bloody stressful for your body and your brain. You are bound to give up. It’s like trying to run a marathon without any proper training. 

I know you want to progress as quickly as possible, but doing more isn’t always better. Rest is as important (if not more) than studying itself. Your brain doesn’t internalise information when you are learning. It connects the dots when you are away from your desk, when you are chilling, meditating, sleeping, or listening to calm music.

I advise you to start with just 5-10 minutes and concentrate on building the habit first. Then, and only then, you are allowed to increase the time. 

Be patient and focus your attention on long-term progress, instead of short-term. Champions and knowledge aren’t created in a matter of days.

**Embrace discomfort**

Learning new information isn’t comfortable. You have to carve out the time in your already busy schedule. You have to be humble enough to admit that you don’t know something. You have to force your mind to concentrate and bring it back whenever it wanders off. Not to mention occasional frustration and anger when you don’t understand a particular topic.

These feelings are integral. You can’t avoid them. They are actually good because they show you that you are moving in the right direction. 

**Don’t forget about geometry**

This point is self-explanatory. I actually find geometry much more interesting (and challenging) than algebra. 

# Conclusion

It saddens me to see that many people consider themselves “genetically bad at maths”. It isn’t true (for most of you, anyway). 

The main reason men struggle to understand mathematics is the lack of fundamental knowledge. 

It is more demanding and challenging to learn about quadratic equations when you have no idea what a linear equation is. It is hard to internalise trigonometry if you have no idea what a Pythagorean theorem is and what sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent are.

I’m writing this post to inspire people who are bad at mathematics to muster their courage and put in the work. I did it, and I believe you can do it.

The days you’re going through are hard, I know this, as I’m going through them myself, but you will never see the purpose of the storm, until you see the growth it actually produces. Hard days aren’t there to make you feel low or to simply destroy you, they are there to build you up, even if it’s from the ground up, you’ll get there, you’ll get back on your feet again, it’s the only way, the only direction you go. 

The situation you’re currently in, it’s *not* your final destination, it’s not your *full-time whistle*, the game will carry on, the show goes on, the clock keeps ticking, the sun will rise again. 

This pain isn’t only here to teach you, or make you grow, but it will benefit you, it will make you a greater you. Trust the dark days you’re experiencing, see it from a different angle, they are there to make you a better person for the present and the future.

Don't Run Away After Being Rejected,8,svrr9m,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/svrr9m/dont_run_away_after_being_rejected/,2,"Have you ever thought that a change of scenery would help you make new friends? You will certainly meet new people but I can almost guarantee you that they’ll be the same kind of people.

It’s tempting to do a full “reset” on your life believing that is the change you need. It can certainly be helpful but it won’t be the cure.

**I would NOT recommend that you ""reset"" and here's why.** The reset is only a temporary fix to help you cope with the feelings that you're having now. Underneath there are some behaviors and patterns that will have you recreate your entire issue.

I know because I moved from several friend groups and cities to find the “right people” for me. And each time, I did the same things that recreated the same problems with the same kind of people.

I was the problem.

There is something lacking interpersonally between me and the people I chose to keep around me. There was a reason I wasn’t connected with them and it's worth identifying EXACTLY what that is.

Right now, you may be trying to create a friendship or connection with random people on dating apps and social media that just leaves you feeling left out overall.

**Rejection is the enemy here. Mastering how to recover is the goal.**

I recommend that you start tackling the uncomfortable feeling rejection brings with something that scares you. Something SMALL that you'd be afraid to do.

* Talk to an adult person directly.
* Ask for something that you've never asked someone for.
* Say something you think would get you rejected.

The goal is to change your mindset about rejection. When we are rejected, we must realize that we also benefit because they are clear about who they are so we don’t have to waste time trying to change them.

I know it's tough to face rejection because I've felt it over and over again. Believe me it hurts to be rejected but it also won't kill you.

Power Through,6,svuj6a,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/svuj6a/power_through/,0,"Valentines Day is a hard time for single people. I say this from personal experience, having never spent the holiday with anyone in a romantic way.

I was talking with a coworker earlier in the week and she was saying how much she didn’t want to be alone on Valentines, and how she was considering calling up an ex for the night. From what I’ve seen and heard, this is a fairly common thing for people to do when lonely, especially on “heart day.”

She and I are pretty good friends so I shared a similar dilemma. For context, I’m coming up on my 200th day after kicking a porn addiction. I’m also single, never had a girlfriend or anything close to sex; and seeing a bunch of ads and movies and songs and shit featuring people in romantic and steamy situations has been stirring up a bunch of lonely thoughts. Those inevitably led to thoughts and an urge of reigniting that old bad habit.

I managed to power through it by painting my bedroom and joining my friend for a board game night at her house. She ended up turning off her phone for the holiday, resisting her desire to jump back into a bad relationship just because Hallmark made a day to sell greeting cards.

Please bear with me as this may be long-winded.

For context, I'm a nearly 26 year old woman. I have dealt with immense mental health issues for the past >12 years and have recently began to recover. Due to this, I'm way behind my peers. I live at home and I don't drive. I recently started my first job since I was 18. 

My parents have babied and sheltered me my whole life while neglecting my emotional needs. This has left me with no sense of resiliency and the tendency to take the easy way out. However, I owe them so much for the care they gave me when I was in the darkest spots of my illnesses. I couldn't have asked for better.

For the past year or so, I've been feeling absolutely suffocated at home. I've realized how little privacy my parents give me (opening my bedroom door without knocking, asking what I'm doing on my phone/laptop all the time, moving my things in my room), and how suffocated I feel by my lack of independence. I also have to play mediator between my parents increasing fights. I am 26 years old and I can't get an hour alone.

I have tried to ask for some space especially in areas where I feel like they (mainly my mother) overstep, such as academics. However it usually ends in a fight. They remind me that I rely on them rides, etc. and this is true. Or my mom will tell get passive aggressive and dramatic, talk about how she's such a horrible mother. It also ends in a huge pendulum swing in which they tell me that I can make dinner for the family tonight, take on all the household chorses etc. - this bothers me because they know I was never taught these basics to care for myself, it feels like they are mocking me a little when they do this.

I know a solution to this is to get my license. I am working on this, but I have a huge fear of driving that makes me a bit unsafe behind the wheel lol. I also know that I should move out. However I don't have that kind of money yet - I am working on it and this is my goal by age 27.

I realize a lot of this post sounds whiny and self pitying. I admittedly am pitying myself right now.

An extra benefit . At the end of the Year (or month) , it's good to see your progression and changes is mindset as well as the many scenarios you've been involved over the course of time and how they made you feel, your own auto-biography .

Difficult to maintain the past and future,1,sw1b8m,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sw1b8m/difficult_to_maintain_the_past_and_future/,2,"Hi everyone. So to paint a picture of myself (23): I always put social life first. For example, whether its trying to convince my friends to go out, planning the next social event, and constant weekend outings .. im the one who always needed to show my face. I would have more anxiety with fomo than I would actually not wanting to be there. Yet, this past year something flipped. It is as if I woke up one day and became a different person. Of course that sounds dramatic, but I just didn’t care to be the one in charge or to go out on every occasion anymore. I put my social life so much first to the point where I didn’t realize how quickly I was growing up. I suddenly felt like I needed to save my money, stop the weekend hangover time waste, and actually figure out what I want to do with my life. I feel myself growing in this respect, but im finding it difficult because I don’t miss the old days. I see my friends here and there but I don’t care to make a plan every weekend. The social media posts don’t seem to give me the fomo it used to. Now, I feel I would rather recharge on weekends and focus on what will help me with my career. 

However, I want some input. I’m afraid I may regret this down the line. I think I am more afraid of the feeling of growing up. I am not saying I will never go out or see anyone because of course I will. But I do not miss the pregame, bar, wanting to go home, wasting money phase.

I don't know what to do right now, I need help (with moving forward in my life, I'm not suicidal or anything). Well, tips/ advice maybe. Depression wise, I've actually been quite fine the past couple of months, and while I've been searching actively for a therapist for a while now, I think I'll be okay on the emotional front. I'm stable enough to focus on other things; it's just every aspect of the ADHD that's been ruining my life. This is going to be a big hybrid, part self-reflection, part vent, part give-me-advice-on-my-situation-to-help-me-get-organized-and-move-on-with-my-life sort of thing. If you do read all of this, then kudos to you, you're the best. Now let me elaborate, as briefly as possible.

Graduated college in January 2019 at age 22, degree in Computer Science. Moved back in with parents. Job searching was difficult, due to low motivation, but got lucky, and by June of that year, found a tech support job: graveyard shift (10pm to 6am), but 5 minutes away from home. Decent salary, no real room for upward movement though. Decent short-term arrangement, still working there today.

The problem: outside of that arrangement, I'd call my life a disorganized wreck. I started off with \*nothing\* outside of work: no real hobbies, no plans, no life. My only real pastime for years, since I was like 7, was videogames, but I started getting bored of this after college, and wanted to find something more interesting and productive. Basically spent all of ages 23 and 24 just going to work, coming home, sleeping, watching some movies here and there, occasionally hanging out with some friends, doing the bare minimum. It sucked, but I didn't question it too much: ""I'm young, I have time to figure things out"", I thought.

Turned 25, everything hits me like a truck. Realized that I don't want to spend another year doing nothing, and if I don't act now, I'll probably waste the next 5 years too. Motivated by a sense of time rushing by, I immediately scheduled appointments for health issues that I'd ignored for years (after several weeks of procrastination for each). There, a little bit of structure and accomplishment, done. I stuck to these appointments, and I'm still working on these health issues today (the one really consistent thing I've done). Then, I asked myself, what other really obvious thing could I do, that's pretty universally beneficial, and could add structure to my life? Fairly straightforward answer, go to the gym consistently. I wanted to do this for years, but just a few months ago, on a good day, visited a good local gym, got a membership, scheduled classes with a trainer twice a week (the only surefire way to get me to go). I've stuck to that since then.

That's the progress I've made. Now, the big issue: I'm not satisfied with this being my life, not at all. I do know some broad goals I want for myself though: I want a higher paying job in my field, in a better specialization than just tech support. I want to move out of my parent's house, and out of my hometown, since it's in a super rural area, with not much around here, and all my old friends have long since moved away. I want to eventually get married and have kids (I'm single currently). I want to make more friends and develop some semblance of a social life (don't really have much of one since I graduated college. The friends I mentioned earlier, are the only ones I really keep in contact with, and rarely. They're an old group from high school, that I find myself not really relating to much in recent years. Most of the time they just hang on discord and play videogames for hours; I want more out of life right now. I do have quite a few acquaintances I've lost contact with over the years, but I've no idea how to reconnect with them, and some social anxiety makes it more difficult).

And now, the day-to-day issues that I've dealt with for years, which have kept me stuck in this rut. A big one, my room is a mess. It's a decent sized room, and the floor is almost completely covered in crap, ranging from DVDs I've impulse bought (""collected"") over the years; to stacks of school papers from 6th grade through college; to stacks of magazines and trading cards; to various binders, video games, boxes for computer parts, and paraphernalia I've brought back from trips in college. I have a lot of stuff, and you could probably call this a hoarding situation. I honestly don't remember the last time the floor of this room was clean; the closest may have been like 7th grade, it's just gotten worse since then. And if it was a simple case of ""chuck this, and this, and this"", maybe I'd have an easier time, but most of this stuff I don't consider easy junk. Too much stuff, not enough storage; I've gotten spurts of energy on occasion to clean it, but quickly stop when I realize I don't know how to begin to sort/ organize anything. My car is in a similar state, and I haven't had the motivation to try to start there.

Motivation. I don't like sitting around doing nothing in my spare time, I don't, but passivity seems to be my default. Well, endlessly scrolling through social media, since when I'm not at work or asleep, that seems to occupy most waking hours, even though I know it's pointless and stupid. I said I wanted to do more than just play videogames all day, and this is true, so I've been trying to find new hobbies, ideally that get me outside. A few I've thought about are hiking trails around me, reading books (haven't finished a book since like 3rd grade, could never focus long enough), maybe some photography. Whenever I think about going for a hike, I rationalize to myself, ""it's too far, not worth the effort"". In that sense, anything outside of the house is a pain to convince myself to do. I've tried reading interesting self-help book, many times: after months, I've gotten a short chapter into one book, because my mind always wanders while I read, and I'll constantly get this feeling that I have something more important I should be doing, so I can't concentrate. Basically, I can never relax enough to do something like that.

I have seemingly no energy or motivation to do any of these things, I never know what I should be doing at any given moment, I have little to no routine in my life. I know social media is fake, but my current end-goal is to to get that picturesque life: get a close-knit, solid group of friends I relate to and can do a variety of things with, get a girlfriend, travel all over the place. I hate the monotonous, empty existence my life is right now. I bought a planner to try to help me schedule and organize, but I rarely write in it, and if I do write in it, I forget to look at it. At work, we actually have hours of down time where we're really not doing anything, and my coworkers do anything from listening to audiobooks to studying for certifications. 99% of the time, I either browse social media (which, yes, I'm probably addicted to) or aimlessly browse reddit, or the web in general. I have a cert I could be studying for, or books I could read there, but again, I struggle to do those things, and have spent two years of this work free-time doing mostly nothing.

I think that touches on the situation pretty thoroughly. I will say that while I'm not currently in therapy, I AM medicated, both for ADHD and the depression/ anxiety. The latter has kept me stable, while the former gives me a fair amount of motivation and energy, but often, I can't direct it properly, and just end up slacking more, or in hours-long marathons of uninterrupted, aimless internet research. I'll also say that the friends thing is a pretty big issue; I self-isolate, for sure, and I struggle to initiate things with people, been that way forever. Would love to change it, no idea how. I'm naturally introverted, yet don't usually want to be alone, and definitely crave an active social life.

That about covers it. Apologies for the length, but my thoughts usually aren't this organized. A lot of my post history the past few months has been emotional snippets of some of these issues, but this is the general summarization I've been trying to put together for a while now. Again, any sort of observations, feedback, advice, potentially great things to try, etc., would all be appreciated.

TLDR: Spent the last 3+ years in a cycle of work, sleep, screw around on social media and the internet. Still live at home with parents at comfortable but dead end job. Struggled with rampant messiness, disorganization, and lack of motivation, direction, and prioritization for years now. Have decent long-term goals, but do mostly nothing all day every day, and struggle find, start, or maintain new hobbies. Have a nonexistent social life and don't know how to meet new people, make new friends, or reconnect with old ones. Don't want to continue this cycle for another 5 years.",1645192155.0
How do I stop constantly thinking about the future?,11,svlcdq,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/svlcdq/how_do_i_stop_constantly_thinking_about_the_future/,5,"I am 24 years old and I'm grateful for a lot of things.

Girlfriend just moved in, have a good salary, 2 dogs, good health, family's in good shape.

The problem is that I'm constantly thinking about the future - on where I should move to, how much money I will be making, where I'll be living and the kind of people I'll be meeting.

It's like my mind is keeps running from the present and it's so frustrating because I feel like I'm losing so much by doing this.

I'm not very sure why I do this, I suspect that it's because I lost contact with pretty much all of my friends since college and that was what kept me grounded.

Feels like my life today is pretty much all work and no play, even though I treat myself constantly and work's really flexible with not much stress.

Hence the desire to move out, I've been fantasizing a lot about living in another country or moving out to a place with more quality of life, beaches and that sort of stuff.

Honestly, I think I really miss having my sort of people around me - last time that happened was in college and it was the best time of my life. It seems like I'm having issues moving past that.

My hope is that by moving somewhere else I'll be happier and attract the sort of people that I'm currently missing so much in my life.

I don't even know why I'm writing this here, I think I just wanted to vent but with the hope of someone commenting that they feel something similar or giving some advice on how to move past these feelings.

I hate how I can shut down my phone for hours and still won't miss anything from anyone because no one actively want to talk to me. I hate how I am usually walking or studying alone in school, and whenever I see an acquaintance in school it is usually just me saying a simple hi rather than having a real small talk. And everytime I reached out to someone through phone, it is either a short casual conversation that usually die off very soon or just me stright up getting ingored and ghosted. 

I am so jealous of people who can open up their phone to like tons of messages and snaps from their friends awaiting for them to check and reply back. That they seems to be texting endless conversations with their friends and having fun all the time. Hell, they can even decide whether they want to check the messages sent by others or not while I don't got to do that. I am so jealous of people in those popular friend groups that seems to be having fun talking and jokin with eachother all the time. 

Seeing all these things and then think back about my social life just makes me more and more depressed. I also have never been into a relationship before, which makes me even more lonely and sometime want to cry uncontrollablely in night.

Just a self hype post,15,svhdl0,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/svhdl0/just_a_self_hype_post/,2,"My God this self improvement shit can get so draining. As bad as we want to be better versions of ourselves, the universe tries its best to drag us down. And perhaps even more of a hindrance is how fucking hard we try to resist change so that we can have comfort and familiarity, no matter how damaging that may be to us.

For years I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety and extreme burnout after a ruthless few years of constant activity and stimulus. I spent so much time wanting to be better but not finding enough willpower to begin actually making the changes. And it’s hard. It’s overwhelming when so much of life seems to go wrong, when there’s so much of ourselves that we wish was different, when we lose family members and friends and find it hard to connect with what’s real anymore.

To survive the hellish life I seemed to be trapped in, I had to learn how to make positive meaning of the things that matter, like love and health and ambitions. And equally as important were the lessons I learned about making meaning of the little moments, making connections between the world I live in and my own story, my own drive. I had to learn how to be aware of my own emotions and thought patterns, and all the different angles with which we can approach problematic events and emotions. 

I’ve been just tryna survive for so long. But last week something beautiful happened. A switch flipped inside me. This will prolly sound like bs but I felt myself transcend. It felt like I reached a new level of peace and self love that I’ve never experienced before (and I’ve tripped on shrooms before so goddamn this blew my mind). And the wildest thing is this feeling hasn’t left me yet (although it’s mellowed down). I’ve been feeling so in tune and ready for change I don’t even recognize myself. But I also knew I had this in me the entire time. I just lost hope for a while Bc life got too overwhelming for me to make sense of it. But I didn’t just get my hope back. I renewed faith in myself. I’m strong enough to handle the shit life’s been throwing at me, and make some good come out of it. I’ve never felt so alive. And I’m just getting started.

I don’t want any of you to lose hope. Talk to someone when you need to. Reddit has saved me on more than one occasion. Find a way to believe in yourself. You have all the reason to, because only you know what you’re truly capable of. Don’t let anyone else tell you what to do. Do it on your terms.

I find myself looking at all the problems in my life, major things that need to be addresses and I just aint doing anything about it. I can easily make the decision of the direction I want to go but GOING is the part I seem to miss out on. For example, I'm in the IT Industry and love working on and repairing electronics. Last year sometime, I got my DBA and taught myself to code so I could build my own website and did it all. Problem is once I got to that point, I just kept telling myself, now you need to advertise your services let people know do this to get more business and kickstart your dream. But...I haven't. I just keep saying yeah, I'll do it, I got to research more on where to go and good advertising practices, that's been nearly 4 months now I told myself that and just won't. I find myself doing this in a lot of things in my daily life now, I know I need to get up and take the trash out or start that goodwill pile or mop that floor. I just don't. I just let it sit there and pile up, then resent myself that much more for letting it get that way and not doing it. It seems like an endless cycle of, tell myself to do it, don't do it, blame myself for not doing it.

Problem is, I know I'm the problem. And admitting it to myself will surely give me the burst of motivation I need to get some of those small tasks done today and tomorrow. But the day after that I'm going to go back to this same cycle, and not think about this problem I'm facing until this moment of self-realization happens again in like three weeks.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

i feel like that is our only connection. i have always been an introvert and i don't like parties, drinking and stuff. i also really dislike hookups and casual sex, i don't mind what people do with their life, i just don't like it for myself. these people all like drinking, partying and literally celebrate parties that consist in kissing one another all night and joke around (but it isn't really a joke) that one night all of them will have sex together.

lately it seems they only talk about people they hate, their past trauma, and sex, and i feel like if i become a healthier individual and more happy and fulfilled these individuals and i will literally have nothing to talk about. 

on top of that, i feel like they pressure me to do things i don't really want to do like insisting that i should go to parties or hook up with random people because that is the right thing to do (?) when i say that i only want to get physical with someone that i'm on a relationship with they stare at me in a very judgemental way.

i appreciate them and i would be really sad to let them go but if they like to do those things i don't fit into the group at all. i don't think they are bad people, it just seems that we are incompatible.

Hey guys, 
I am (in my opinion) highly skilled in my field and can find applicable solutions to problems coming my way (in work on projects mostly).

My problem is, I am rather bad at making these solutions easily visible to others; Basically, after detailed explanations people agree, but it’s always an uphill battle. 

Often I see others who (perceivedly) do much less work, but are better at selling themselves and their solution. 

I was already tolled that I have a very complicated way of thinking, just the way I am and it’s a part of me. And it delivers the key solutions to problems, so I don’t want to change it. So I want to learn how to sell myself and my ideas better. 

So I ask you what areas I should work on?

I rate myself:
- technical skills in pptx 9/10
- design skills in pptx 7/10 
- speaking skills 7/10 (I speak freely without notes, use fillwords sometimes)
- structure presentations (hard to rate, probably quite good, was told I am creative)

I cannot think of other criteria, that might be a hint already. Also I am quite focused on presentations, yet, I know that underlying skills are more important. I just don’t know how to pinpoint them, that might be a hint.

Could you please suggest areas of improvement and material for these areas?",1645215969.0

Well it's not yet too late for me to fix my mistakes so let's hope the force is on my side... A meme post coming about it soon 

Here are some other lessons that slapped me today:

- There's really no point trying to look for what you want on the internet, you need to improve yourself, stop watching things related to it unnecessarily and focus on getting things moving

- You never know what will happen in a few months, just treasure all experiences and focus on your present.

- Don't lock away or focus on your negative emotions, there's a good chance it will backfire later on.

- If you are practising something, stay focused on the practice. Don't get disturbed by results that come mid way unless you wanna loose the ultimate result.

How to know the ultimate result? Meh no clue and it really depends
 
- Stay true to your words, that's how you become a being with who's words have meaning.

I am needing help with creating a night routine during a difficult period of my life. I’ve been emotionally struggling for 7 months since my relationship with my partner/gf began decaying and becoming unhealthy/toxic. I ended things this past weekend and I’m still not super well. 

Despite this, I have a morning routine that I have been able to do every morning for the past month since I got my own place. I get up when my alarm goes off, make my bed while setting an intention for the day, do a little work out/yoga routine, then meditate. I’ve been able to do this consistently even when I go to bed too late or feel blah and want to snooze. 

On the other hand, when I get home from work, I’m typically able to do one productive thing and then I feel like “I don’t have enough energy to do something I actually like”(which probably isn’t true, I’m just going through a tough time)(read, guitar, journal, to do lists), so I end up distractedly watching tv or YouTube for 2 hours, stay up too late (11PM), and feel blah. 

I have some self-judgement because I have an alarm that goes off at 9PM to remind me to wind down (I’d love to just drink some tea, maybe have an evening meditation, get in bed, and then journal or read a graphic novel until I get tired). But I think I’ve only been able to do this once and I’ve been trying for several months.

Genuine question: How to stop being cringey?,35,suxoeu,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suxoeu/genuine_question_how_to_stop_being_cringey/,23,"Please delete if not allowed. I apologize in advance if this type of question is not allowed. 

Question for those of you who have improved yourselves over time… is there a way I can stop being “cringey.” To clarify, I mean how do I stop being embarrassing or awkward? Do you have any suggestions? 

I’ve come a long way from who I used to be. I was very into fandom culture (I know, I know). I used to post to social media a lot until honestly, I got pretty bullied for it and changed my ways. Without too much context, I found out most of the people I knew were talking about this without me there. Even my best friend was embarrassed by my behavior and social media posts about “fandom.” 

Now it’s been about ten years. I am in my late twenties. I’ve eliminated social media posting for the most part and deleted my old accounts. I’ve changed my fashion and makeup by watching videos on YouTube. I’ve read some self help books and worked on by body as well to lose weight (still working on this but have lost twenty pounds since then). I have a job and friends and have moved in with my partner. Unfortunately, I’m still plagued by having dorky hobbies. I just keep them a secret. Any advice to be more normal or at least fit in a bit better with other people? 

And I know there are some very cool people into fan culture, video games, etc. I just haven’t found a good way to interact with it without being dubbed kind of a loser.",1645127744.0
Cognitive strength. Main Factor for Success & Happiness,5,sv9nrq,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sv9nrq/cognitive_strength_main_factor_for_success/,2,"Cognitive control is being able to override your instincts and emotions. E.g. not eating fast food. It tastes good short term, but long term you benefit from not eating it.  

Studies that followed up on the famous „Stanford Marshmallow“ Experiment showed, that Kids that can override their emotions of instant gratification in return of later even bigger reward are more successful in work and also social life. In General those are more happy. 

Control over your cognition has more impact on your life than your IQ. The main key is to learn and train, that the decay of future rewards (good or bad) shouldn’t be to strong. E.g. from the experiment: 2 Marshmallows after 15 minutes shouldn’t be worth less than 1 marshmallow now. 

Another key takeaway from those experiments: You can train your Cognitive control! 

All around us gives us immediate gratification(instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Amazon, etc…). To train your willpower, that delayed gratification is not too bad we need a timer. And the timer extends each time we end the timer without getting the dopamin. 

The „Marshmallow“ Timer app is my way of training myself and my cognitive strength to accept delayed gratification and regain control over my instincts and emotions.",1645160975.0

How do I improve my tolerance to pressure/giving up easily,4,svak0m,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/svak0m/how_do_i_improve_my_tolerance_to_pressuregiving/,12,"Job applications, interviews, as soon as any effort is required, I just give up. I can't handle the pressure and want to do well, but the competitive nature makes me think, I'm not good enough, let me just give up now before even trying.

Example: a highly competitive thorough, selective, competitive job interview and application is my nightmare. I'd take MONTHS to do an application if I badly want it because I'd be so scared I'm doing it wrong or saying the wrong things because I want it badly. I'd then dread the interview as I hate having to prove myself or my worth to others or comparing myself to others. It feels degrading and the thought of it makes my anxious, withdrawn and depressed. I want to crawl into a hole than attend an interview. I hate that feeling of interrogation, I can't handle the pressure and nerves it causes. I hate having to prove my worth. 

I want to be one of those people - that can just go to job interviews and applications with confidence - how can I become like that? I used to be like that surprisingly enough growing up. But now I constantly degrade and doubt myself and lack the stamina. I used to think I got this, I'm better than everyone, now I think I'm useless, I don't have this.

Also things like, keeping a healthy sleep cycle, I lack any self discipline.

It's holding me back. I want to have a normal and successful, productive life, but this mindset gets in the way. I want to be someone who wakes up at a normal time, does normal things, works hard for things they want, doesn't throw in the towel as soon as they feel anxious. I just like, safe, secure things, I hate challenege or pressure, it makes me sick to my stomach.

But I know and want to get over this. I want to try and change. I know I need to change to progress in life. Everything in life will likely come with these pressures after all.

Don't know what happened. I genuinely used to be bold and think I was indestructible when I was 18 and could do anything I dreamed off and that I'd smash every application. I think I burnt out, or that I got depressed that 'hustling' isn't actually getting me anyway and starting to give up/throw in the towel",1645163974.0

I’m 20 to be specific. Despite their young age, they’re all really successful and cool. One of my friends is a tattoo apprentice/barista with a really good social life. Another is a flight attendant who rents an apartment with her boyfriend of 2 years. My other friend is a hostess at an upscale restaurant. I also have friends of friends who are models, influencers, or at the very least have good paying jobs. 

Then there’s me. Unemployed, broke, and still living at home. More specifically, I live at my grandparents house and share a room with my mom and occasionally my younger brother (my brother has his own room at his dads house). I had to leave my childhood home at 13 and I lost all my belongings. On top of that, my grandparents don’t like pets so we had to give my cat back to the shelter, and my dog, who I loved with my entire being, ran away. It was a really big shock and I think that’s where my depression started. Living with my grandparents hasn’t been horrible but it definitely sucked the life out of me. I haven’t developed any passions or talents and nothing motivates me. I was also homeschooled since the 5th grade if that means anything. I feel too dumb to go to college and I don’t even know what I would major in. 

Everyone says I can have a life like my friends if I stop comparing myself and work hard. While that may be true, I just keep comparing myself to them. They’re my age or younger and they already have something going for them. I want to be independent and have a life of my own but I just feel like a failure. If I had my own room or went to high school like my friends did, maybe things would be different. I can’t afford therapy so I’m trying to get a job but I’m afraid it’ll just make my depression worse. I’ve had so many interviews set up just for me to cancel them because of anxiety and fear.

Right or wrong, we are all human and imperfect.

However: I am struggling to be this way with people with physical disabilities/deformities and I'm not sure why.  I want to be the same way with everyone and I try to, but I feel exhausted and uncomfortable, like I'm not being myself, when I ""act"" kind.

It's strange, because I started out very accepting, so I never had to actively develope that skill until lately.  It is healthy, and a good sign that I am actually compassionate, that I want to get better with this.  But I'm not sure how.  

People might say practice makes perfect, but I don't want to stare and hurt someone with my knee-jerk reactions.  I am an ""emotions on my sleeve"" kinda person that will show discomfort easily.  So I want a way to practice before interacting with real people.  Actually... my staring is rarely ""ew, get away from me"", but rather ""oh wow, I want to observe and learn more.""  I don't even want their life story half the time, just... I want to SEE them and try to understand.  Like, uh... trying to solve a puzzle?  My mind is fully engaged.  

Even different races, I LOVE staring, because they are so amazingly different.  How do they act?  Why do they act like that?  How do they dress?  Oh wow, those colours look great on that skin tone!

- Blocking work time, MSc time, and side-hustle time so that I DO have time to try to earn a little extra money. 

- Quitting drinking (not a big drinker but a couple drinks twice a week soon adds up)

- Cycling more

- Sleeping more - so I’m more switched on and make better decisions

Hell, one of my friends tried to say I was good at something, but when she tried to find an example, she just went silent. I hate myself and I hate being seen as the dumbass of the group.

Naturally, I want some sort of skilled hobby to learn. I tried an MMA class, I thought about learning to draw, making games, and I'm considering getting back into guitar or archery. But I realized that I don't actually care about any of that stuff. I quit guitar because I didn't like it after all.

Have you guys heard about the Maharishi Effect? They were doing an experiment a while back in Mozambique. In 1992, their president Chissano learned the technique of Transcendental Meditation and introduced it to government officials and their families. Two years later, Chissano and his generals ordered all police and military personnel to meditate twice a day for 20 minutes. The result was political peace and a decrease in crime by 30 percent. Also impressive three times the expected economic growth.

So what does it actually mean for all of us? Together we can change the situation of the pandemic, economic downturn or anything we need. This is a message for those who are tired of sitting and waiting for someone to come and change their life. Each of us has unlimited potential. We can do much more than what we think we can. And the only thing that can try to stop us is our own mind.

We are looking for people who are ready to change and awaken their true selves. We have a methodology of how to get to a higher level of consciousness. The awakening gives you an understanding of who we are and what is the purpose of being. We will be happy to help anyone on their journey. Dm me if interested",1645176548.0

Take purposeful breaks before you consume the next piece of useful information,9,suw6rd,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suw6rd/take_purposeful_breaks_before_you_consume_the/,2,"Imagine if instead of feeding information, our phones start feeding us food, actual food. So, whenever you consume content, the phone software will add more calories into your body.

Now ask yourself if you will still choose to use the phone as much as you use it currently. Will you still watch so many cute and funny videos, will you still read so much political stuff, will you still binge on all those series?

Ideally, not. Because among other things, your body will not be able to process so much additional food. It won't be able to digest it. Your stomach will explode.

Information has a similar effect on your brain. Too much information leaves your brain unable to properly process and digest the stuff you have consumed. It needs breaks and intervals, just like we need intervals between meals.

I had a classmate in my school who you could always find reading someything. He was an avid reader, always going in and out of our school library. One would believe so much reading would have lead him to become much wiser and smarter, right? Wrong! He was one of the stupidest and dumbest of people I have ever met who had little ideas to offer (I know because I tried befriending him and got to know him for some time).

There was a time when I fantasized about reading a book a day. I soon came to realize that a good book is a compact set of ideas that take time to unpack. I once read a philosophical book and I needed a couple of months before I could pick up another book. I told myself that that's okay. Because I learnt a great deal in that time as I contemplated on the ideas articulated in that book.

So leave yourself some time to process things. Whether you are consuming useless stuff, or useful stuff, give yourself purposeful breaks to process all the data that you are feeding into your brain.

Purposeful breaks do not mean resting and sleeping. Those things are separately necessary within their respective required limit.

If you read about or listen to a new idea, and if it impresses upon you, wait till its novelty and euphoria subsides. Be alert and be conscious as you watch yourself getting less and less entertained by the idea. Then play the devil's advocate and try to identify the flaws in that idea. If it withstands your test of cynicism, allow yourself to indulge in that idea a little more. Then try implementing it. Once you make a habit out of it, go ahead and pick up another piece of information in that category.

This is indeed a slow process, but it ensures that you don't forget what you learn.

My question is, why do I act in a way that screws myself over? It’s only me who loses out, and I really want to achieve my goals… so why do I always do the bare minimum? I feel like this inclination has always existed in me, right back to school. Smart but doing the bare minimum.

I try to keep myself busy, I go to a yoga studio daily and I am currently getting my bartenders license. But other than that, I rarely leave my apartment. I spend majority of my week just sitting in my apartment because I am scared to do things alone.

Can’t improve any aspect of myself.,2,sv0z0w,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sv0z0w/cant_improve_any_aspect_of_myself/,0,"I’ve been making attempts to improve myself and be likable and approachable and for once to actually enjoy existing.

Nothing I’ve done has made me feel anymore better of myself. 

I’ve started working out last year and eating more, I do look bulkier but I still have no confidence to go and approach women.

I’ve been more sociable; I am in dorms now in my second semester of college and I socialize very often with my dormmates whom are successful than I am due to them being in constant relationships. I have socialized more with the people in my classes but never once has anyone in college and before college (highschool) has anyone ever approached me to get to know me more. I found friends but they didn’t find me so to speak. I feel like I wasted $ dorming; nothing has changed in my social life.

I’ve tried vigorously to improve on things I enjoy doing like hobbies but only bit by bit do I notice change, and I have no idea what I’m doing wrong without a professional pointing it out like bowling or even the art that I make— video games etc

In the end I still feel like a push-over, magnanimous nobody that everyone likes but could care less about. My friends don’t reach out to me unless I start the conversation. No idea what to do with my life as I see the only fulfilling thing that I can do for myself Is to end it.",1645136153.0

Are you taking on enough electives and special projects?,8,suoop4,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suoop4/are_you_taking_on_enough_electives_and_special/,0,"Work is unavoidable. Even outside of your professional work there is always personal work to be done. Your personal work falls into 3 categories:

&#x200B;

1. **Chores** These are the basics you have to do daily, weekly, monthly or annually to maintain the status quo. (And to keep all your teeth.)
2. **Electives** These are the things you choose to do that set you apart from others. (Even without tattoos and piercings.)
3. **Special projects** These are the bigger challenges you take on that have the ability to transform you. (In non-surgical ways.)

### Chores

Chores don’t come with a choice. You don’t have the option not to do them. Although you can choose not to do them well. Or often. Which drops you below the basic human level of acceptability. Which is a great way to get yourself on a TV show like *Hoarders*, *Intervention*, or *My 600-pound Life*. You can, however, choose to do your chores very well. Which is a good habit to get into, and sets the tone for how you approach everything else in life.

### Electives

Electives are the things you do that you don’t have to do. These are the activities that separate you from others and help make you interesting. They give you flavor, like Flavor Flav. They create your differentiation and your unique advantages.

Your electives include your hobbies, and interests. They also include all of your self-education, reading, podcasts, studying and training. Your electives include exercise, cooking, and meditation. Seeing a therapist or a coach are great electives. As are writing, volunteering, coaching and creating music. If you have a hard time coming up with interests to include in your work bio, online dating profile or obituary, you probably need more electives.

If there is not much elective activity in your life then you are not doing as much as you could to create joy and competitive advantages. And you are probably not making the most of your time.

Evaluating your electives is a great place to start when evaluating your life, trajectory, happiness, and achievement. Happiness is rooted in your electives. Make sure you have them, and that you participate in them frequently enough to find enjoyment, fulfillment and growth.

### Special Projects

Special projects create opportunities for transformation. They are often an expansion of an elective. Writing a book, going back to school and trips to an exotic location are all examples. So is starting a business, a major physical challenge, or a significant career change. Special projects often provide an inflection point in our human experience, sending us on new, better and more enlightened paths.

### Key Takeaway

Make sure you are always dedicating time to your electives. They are your difference makers. They are the building blocks of an enjoyable life. They fertilize your happiness. Your electives are gateways to bigger, more important activities that can become defining events and undertakings of your life. It is hard to transition directly from chores to special projects. Your electives are the bridges that help get you there.",1645104096.0
Could learning to love other ppl around me be a life changer?,2,suzr3a,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suzr3a/could_learning_to_love_other_ppl_around_me_be_a/,0,"I think you guys heard of this poor kid who killed himself because of bullying. That news hit rlly close to home because I remember also being bullied sometimes at school and how that ended up with me having insecurities about every aspect of my appearance and my personality, and also having depression and an ED when I was just 12. The things is that that changed with the years, ppl kept being mean to me and excluding me but since like seven grade it was mainly because of me being generally mean and angry all the time. And last year, the last year of school for me, I changed schools but I was so stuck in the ambience of that other school where ppl had always excluded me and treated me like shit that I didn't give myself the opportunity to become a new person in a place where ppl was more than open to accept me. And I told my mom about this {She didn't know ppl used to tease me at school when I was little because I never told her) and how hard it was for me to leave that behind, but I told her this when last year was finishing and my journey at school was pretty much over.

But now that the story of this kid appeared I realized that I've also been pretty abusive to the ppl I love and love me. I grew up with a rlly mentally abusive dad who manipulated me to always follow his rules even though he was an ass both to my mom and me, he didn't even love me but he was so disgusted with us living in his apartment that he treated us like crap and if he didn't follow his rules he wouldn't speak to us for months, he would be even meaner than usual. He didn't beat us or something but he was rlly abusive in many ways. And I think that this caused me to be like him a lot of times with the ppl that loved me, specially my mom. I thank god that maybe most of those ppl forgave me, but I find it hard to forgive myself. And honestly, I realized that if my whole life I've had trouble with making emotional connections with ppl (Meaning that I've always señf sabotaged myself so much that I never let any relationship, in a friendly way or even a crush last) it was not only because of how extremely self-conscious and insecure I've been most of my life, but also because I used to be a crazy bitch who would treat ppl poorly and never let them get close to me enough, pushing everyone away and by the time I tried being nicer it was too late and everyone had already catalogued me as a crazy bitch that nonone should hang out much with. I tried doing what everyone said, I was a needy people pleaser but at the same time way so deep inside my mental chaos that I ended up coming of as grumpy all the time. I would've done anything so that the ppl I hung out with at school would actually take me as a real friend, but I was also always pushing them away somehow and I was never someone gun to be with. And I know that this was caused mostly because of the chaos going on in my family, but I also know that that is no justification.

So now I know most ppl I've been mean to has pretty much forgiven me, they know that now I'm trying to do better, but is there a way in which I can start appreciating people more so that this behavior doesn't repeat? I don't ever wanna be like this again, Im 18 and my life is already starting again, so I know that if I do something to change now it could benefit me, and others, probably for the rest of my life. I'm glad I took the time to think about my behavior so I didnty come up to this conclusion when I was already too old to do something, but I still need to change and I don't know how.

For instance the thought of sex is way more interesting than sex itself, the thought of travelling somewhere way better than doing it or the thought of having a gaming console way better than actually gaming with it.

so in my high school there was this group of guys which were “the popular group”,  in the process of getting used to the new virtual classes, I thought of join them, so time passed and maybe in the 1st quarter of 2021, I was fully one of them.

This guys weren’t like that kind of nerdy type of people, they were more like, always trying to be superior than everybody, always trying to be more than anybody; when I first noticed this I had this thought of maybe being like them is gonna bring some better things to my life, which it dis, for a while, but then I started to realize that maybe being a little bit more humble, and careful with things that really matter, like my relationship with my family or my interaction with new people wouldn’t always be so egocentric, yes I have my ego but I’m not throwing it away every time I’m talking to someone.

My point is, the best people you can be surrounded by are nice and humble persons, which really do you a favor on you everyday activities or interactions in a good way.

I'm not passionate about anything.,3,suvapi,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suvapi/im_not_passionate_about_anything/,1,"Long Post. Past few years i have been trying to find what i like or enjoy the most but i cant find anything that I'm passionate about and it's eating me from the inside, i have no response when someone asks me what i love doing, no matter how much i search inside myself i find nothing, i am empty, i feel empty, i don't feel human, i feel like i am a fraud, i have cousins half my age how know or atleast have an idea of what they like to do, all the things i have ever liked were phases, things/hobbies i enjoyed for some time then never picked back up and they weren't even practical enough that i could get a job in them.

 When i passed 12th i had really bad marks and that depressed me cause i knew no good college would take me, even then i didnt know what degree i should do, one of the interests i had as a child was computers so i thought that maybe that's the answer, three years into my degree which is almost ending i feel like i have no interest in coding or computers, i saw that people dropout in between their degrees cause they find a better calling, and i was jealous of them cause i wanted to do that too but i realised i don't have any other interest/calling for me to dropout and pursue instead and that depressed me even more.

 I have been severely depressed for 2-3 years now, the mental pain has been really intense for a year now and i don't see light at the end. All of reddit tells me to go to a therapist but I've tried that too and it didn't work, therapists give the most cliche responses ever, my therapist suggested to see a career counsellor which i hesitated cause i knew it wouldn't help and i didn't want to waste money on it, i did it anyway hoping for something, the test was the one where you have to choose one option from 4-5 each signifying an interest, in most of those questions i didn't like any of the option and had to choose the least hated one, obviously when the results weren't what i liked, tech was in 3rd place of my interests and the first two i denied having interest in, so the counsellor asked me if i have something in my mind that i liked instead and i had no reply so he said that means tech(computers) was the right decision but i don't like it either. 

The thing is i could just do this degree, get a normal job and live life but the existential dread is really weighing on me and i don't want to waste my life on a computer for 10 hours add to that i have a habit of genuinely comparing myself to extremely talented people that were prodigies at 6, mix all of these and i get an existential crises and an urge to achieve something great and not be a common simpleton, but I'm 21 now and its too late, I'm too old for that, legends achieved those great things because they started really early and i feel like i have ruined my life, i feel like I'm 80, tired and burnt out.",1645121515.0

How to stop being judgmental?,2,suxk21,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suxk21/how_to_stop_being_judgmental/,2,"Hi!

I recently realized that I'm much more judgmental than I thought I already was. I criticize everything and everyone that doesn't relate to my moral values, mainly in my head because I know I'm an asshole but sometimes I say it aloud. I want to become tolerant.

It became worse a few years after going vegetarian and minimalistic. I was so angry against the system that makes people need so much resources it fucking destroys the planet while enslaving the poorest. I was angry against the system but I turned bitter toward people.

For example, I'm in my mid-20s and friends are starting building projects. I am unable to feel happy and to support them if they tell me they bought an appartment on credit or plan to build a huge house or having a baby, because now they'll be stuck in their jobs and focus on earning money, and it makes me sick that they no longer want to hang out or just chill together because they worked so hard they are tired in the weekend, or because they have to spare money for the 20 fucking next years. I always want people to justify themselves, because I am able to live in a garage and eat from the supermarkets trash and buy only second hand.

Even for the simplest things I'm so condescending, like I'll always have to comment and correct the way my boyfriend uses the cooktop or washes the dishes, although I know he has a really-low self esteem so why can't I just shut the fuck up

I am so bad for the people I love and I really want to change, cultivate acceptance and tolerance, be open to their reality. I used to be like this until early-20s but I lost myself in anger and bitterness.

Did anyone manage to improve themselves in this way or am I doomed to stay a complete egoistic asshole? How do I practice acceptance?

Simplifying Our Mental View,2,surq9g,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/surq9g/simplifying_our_mental_view/,2,"We make simple things complicated:

* **Overwhelm**: Doing one task at a time is pretty simple, but we get overwhelmed by all the things. We think about an entire list of things that we haven’t done yet, and we feel stressed about it, and end up feeling like we can’t do any of it.
* **Beating ourselves up**: If we didn’t do what we thought we should do, we feel like we did things wrong, and we chastise ourselves for not doing things right. This discourages us from just simply starting again.
* **Frustration with another person**: If people don’t behave the way we want them to, we can get frustrated … and then it can derail us from our intentions.
* **Fear about what might happen**: Let’s say you need to have a conversation with someone, but you’re afraid of how they might react … you might put off that conversation because of that fear, instead of simply talking to them.

There is nothing wrong with doing all of this — it’s human. This is how our minds work.

However … if we bring awareness to our added mental layer, **we can simplify it by letting go of that extra layer**. 

It’s about doing things as simply as possible.

For example:

&#x200B;

* **Decluttering**: Most people overcomplicate it, because they feel overwhelmed by how much there is to declutter in their house or office. What would it be like to let go of this layer of “there’s so much!” and just start with one small area? Pick up one thing at a time in that area. Ask yourself if you use/love it or want to get rid of it, and put it in one of two piles. Repeat.
* **Email & messages**: Like clutter, the idea of “there’s so much!” can overwhelm us and stop us from simply acting. Instead, what if we let go of that mental layer, and just spent 20 minutes taking messages/emails one at a time? Deal with each message before moving on. Repeat.
* **Tasks**: Same idea — we have so many things to do that it overwhelms us and stresses us out, makes acting on things more difficult. Letting go of the idea of “there’s too much,” we can simply pick the most important thing to work on right now, and focus only on that.
* **Habits like exercise or meditation**: We have lots of ideas about how hard the exercise is or how we haven’t been meditating as much as we “should” have been … and it creates extra stress and obstacles to just doing the exercise or meditation. What if we let all of that go, and simply went out for a walk or did some pushups? What if we let all of that go and simply sat down to meditate for a few minutes? Habits can be that simple, without all the extra mental layers.

I know it’s not as simple as that, because letting go of the mental layers isn’t always easy. But the point is that it *could* be simple. It could be much easier, if we could let go of those layers.

So then the practice is to repeatedly let go of the layers. Do things as simply as possible, not worrying about all the usual thoughts about “shoulds” and “too much” and “it shouldn’t be this way.” Removing these extra mental layers, we can simplify our lives greatly.

How to be more fun to be around?,4,sulspz,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sulspz/how_to_be_more_fun_to_be_around/,11,"Hey,

A girl I was in a relationship with told me two days ago that she felt nothing anymore for me. She's always been extremely complicated on an emotional level so I won't take all the blame, if there is any blame to take, but there were parts of our relationship in which I was definitely lacking. The next paragraph just gives you context and informations about myself, you can read or skip it if you want.

I have always been an intellectual person, have never had the same outlook on life as anyone, have never had the same hobbies as everyone, have never liked small talk and mundanity. I have always been looking to understand the world and people on a deeper level, and that's what made that girl and I connect. She has always had tonnes of friends, but she was depressed and felt empty inside. When we met, our sensibility and sad past made us connect more than anyone we had known, but it wasn't enough. 
She said that while I made her feel alive, I didn't make her happy, and I think it's true. I've always been there to look after her, support her when she was feeling bad, make her feel like she was worth something and that life was better and had meaning. That's what I've always done with people, encouraging and empowering them, showing them that they meant something and that life was meaningful. But outside of those moments where we could talk about profound things, not much happened between us. She was too indecisive to take initiatives and I lived in my own world too much to get out of it. She had more fun with other people than with me. The good times we spent together, when we had those deep discussions, were a pinnacle for both of us but they were rare. Outside of them, we didn't exist. I didn't exist because I just don't know how to, outside of big talks.

So yeah, that inability to engage in mundane things makes my social life very difficult and isolates me, which I'm starting to dread because I feel like I'm missing on a lot of things that life has to offer. I have a lot to say, but not on the topics that you talk about in everyday life, and the thing is that you can't have profound conversations everyday. I'd love if it were the case, but she made me realise that it's not possible. I can small talk, be fun and get along with everyone but only under very specific conditions, such as when I drink, am very tired or in an awesome mood. Basically, when my state makes me lose my inhibitions. Outside of that, I don't know how to approach people, don't have a clue what to say, think that all I'm going to say is ridiculous and lose my sense of humour. So, what to do? Is it possible to change when you've always been like that?

Thanks a lot and sorry if there are English mistakes, it's actually not my native language. :)",1645094147.0
Beginning my journey of improvement,2,suvk22,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suvk22/beginning_my_journey_of_improvement/,0,"# PS, I had already posted this on the MONKMODE subreddit but wanted to share it on here as there are more people with similar posts and thought I would get more support and insight.  

# Beginning my journey

📷

After a few hours of lurking through subreddits and researching Monkmode on youtube. I have decided to take up the journey starting from to day the 17th Feb 2022. What I aim to get from this journey is more clarity and improved self discipline. I am not preforming well in my University and not quite happy with my current work, as I could be earning more if I had spent extra time improving my skills, refineing my cv and actually pursuing any prospects I have relentlessly.

Another point of improvement I aim for is workout religiously. I am going to start with 20 pushups and 20 sit ups for the first week and double it for every week. I also will sign up for gym next week and lift weights to attain the maximum muscle gains so I can start taking boxing lessons.

There are other things I would love to improve in my life through this journey such as getting better at swimming, guitar lessons and getting a motorcycle licence. However, I am only going to focus on the fundamentals only for the next month and will slowly build upon my progress.

I hope to update you all weekly and hope to get any support if I need it.

Thanks.",1645122188.0

Stop Doing What You Shouldn’t Do,19,suce1p,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/suce1p/stop_doing_what_you_shouldnt_do/,5,"That thing you’re currently doing that you shouldn’t do will one day come back to you and bite you on the backside. Right now, it may feel normal, as if you’re not doing much wrong, but you are, it’s wrong and you should stop doing so. 

Do you want to live a life full of regret, shame and guilt? 

I’ll answer that for you - **no**. It’s about discipline yourself and stop doing that *1* or *many* things that you shouldn’t do, it will become very unhealthy in the long run. 

If you have the chance to turn your life around, you take it, simple as that, no questions asked. I’m not perfect, you’re not perfect, nobody is perfect, we will trip up in life, we will go down the wrong road, but it’s then *YOUR* choice to take a step back and realise that what you’re doing is wrong and something needs to change. 

We have habits, we make mistakes, we do things we shouldn’t do - and trust me, it will not go over-night, it takes time, dedication and most importantly - belief. You must believe in yourself in order to get out of this bad chapter of your life, because who else will? You may be hiding this secret battle you’ve been playing with yourself in your head and your too ashamed to tell your family or friends, if that’s the case, make yourself proud. Be there for yourself, always support yourself and never give up changing for the better. 

That one thing that comes in your mind when you think of “*I need to stop doing that*”, you need to stop it this second and believe that you won’t do it today, tomorrow, next week, next month and next year. 

You’ve got what it takes to get out of this position that you’re in, but at the moment, you’re your own enemy, you create problems for yourself by doing something that you shouldn’t. Stop it! 

Stay positive, take each day as they come, celebrate the little victories and believe in the person you are. I promise, you can overcome this, I fully believe in you.",1645061763.0

(m20) feeling lost and like a loser,1,sutdw3,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sutdw3/m20_feeling_lost_and_like_a_loser/,0,"Hello Reddit,

I am a 20 year old male and i feel like a total loser because i take no action forward and am fulled by anxiety. I just sit on my ass all day on my phone or the tv and am unproductive. I failed to get into university for dentistry because i didn't do an additional test for medical students which in retrospect probably would've helped me to get a place. I fear even if i did get a place i would probably fail because all the people around me tell me how clumsy i am. I know that there is also other medical professions but in the country where i live (germany) they have a worse work/life balance which is very important to me. The problem is i dont really have any talents, passions or that i am gifted in any area. I was good at school and learning facts but only because i tried very hard and had almost no social life. I did this because i feared becoming like my dad who has been jobless and unconventional nearly as long as i know him sadly i feel like we share a lot of characteristics like being forgetful, clumsy, procrastinating etc.
I have social anxiety and suspect adhd but until i get my first appointment it takes months. In my mind i know the steps to do like meditate, stop fapping, become proactive, search a job/do new things but i can't get myself to do them i feel paralyzed of action and distract myself with instant gratification like watching a movie or something. I can retake this medical test in a year from now but even then i dont know if they will accept me or if i will fail because of my lack of skill or lack of passion. I think i want to do this but i don't really know, in my naive mind i want a job where i can have a positive impact on other people and feel appreciated, work independently and make a lot of money.
In the last month ive also strongly craved after being loved from an attractive woman but i figured hence my situation and my average/below average looks i shouldn't even give it a try.


Sorry if i come across as pathethic or a prick but if anyone has any advice on what i could do to make my situation better or give me some sort of motivation i would highly appreciate it :)",1645116765.0
Getting my shit together day 21,9,sufz8w,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sufz8w/getting_my_shit_together_day_21/,0,"2 exams tomorrow, we'll see how I do. I hope I can prepare more for the next ones.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1645072325.0

Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like ""I didn't have much more to say"" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.

**Two minors issues**

* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed,  I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).
* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)

**My two biggest issues**

* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking ""ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?"" and the thought really really scares me.
* **Dating** \--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think ""Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?"" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).

**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",1645101466.0

- I will have brushed my teeth twice (I’ve never been particularly good at night time brushing and have the gum problems to prove it but of late it’s been good if I’ve brushed them once)
- I will have actually drank some water (hate water, my workaround is cheap sugar free flavoured water which I did follow up with some plain water yesterday)
- Taken my vitamins 
- Eaten relatively healthy/wholesome food (as opposed to living off of Uber eats takeaway and alcohol)
- I have gotten out of bed with time to do stuff before work rather than jumping out of bed at the last minute and rushing around 
- showered daily

I have a good career in the trades. Own my own condo, own a car, pets and all that. 

I’ve recently started going to the gym 4 times a week back in October. Everything seems decent but one are I’ve been struggling in is the dating scene. I try to go out to meetups which is usually how I socialize but I also have no way of connecting with people. Everyone seems to have interests or hobbies. I don’t have any at all, the problem is that I simply do the same thing every day but I’m also content with it. 

I go the gym, I walk my dog, I cook and then I just go watch TV or go on Reddit. Then sleep. 

I’ve realized at my last meetup that conversations don’t last long for me. Because I have no real connection to people or any topics. I don’t know much about any hobbies and I don’t have any way of motivating myself to really branch out and try them. Even though I have tried some. I tried Kickboxing and that lasted a month. It was fun but honestly I just couldn’t keep up with the classes and the rest of the group kept progressing while I was stuck. I tried learning an instrument and the same thing, I kept being too slow and I just couldn’t figure out things fast enough. 

I feel like I’m stuck in perpetual Boredom. Personally I’m “okay” with it. But it stunts my social growth. Because at the end of the day I have nothing to real bring to conversation. Even just topics of interest like space or history or anything. I just literally have nothing to add. Im not interested in comic books, or marvel movies. 

It’s hard for me to just be interested in something. Right now the gym is my only real activity that I do outside of cooking or cleaning. Other than that it’s reading blogs about dating. But I’m starting to realize that my lack of confidence may also stem from the fact that I generally have no way of being an interesting person because all I do is exist with nothing else going on. Even going to the gym is just to have a better body so I can possibly date. But nothing else in regards to personality exists. 

How do I just find something that’s interesting. Everything I look into or try just becomes boring or doesn’t catch my attention. While it seems everyone around me is into SOMETHING. I’m just not into anything.  Instruments, sports, movies, tv shows. 

How do I just find something when I generally can’t even think of anything that would keep my attention for more than a few weeks?",1645057604.0

Finishing a giant project in one night and running from a grizzly bear are examples. Fear in those situations makes sense, and it is a totally justifiable response. We know that there is difficulty, risk, or danger and we understand the worst case scenario.

But some things are scary just because we do NOT understand the worst case scenario. Going to an event where we don’t know anyone, trying something new for the first time, presenting our work to someone who might judge us. These are situations where we don’t really know what will happen. Logically we know they probably aren’t life or death situations, but emotionally we get anxious because our mind plays up all the things that could go wrong. All the scenarios where people might reject us, we might fail or be judged harshly, or we might feel shame or humiliation. These types of feelings are understandable - but not as justified as the first. They are not fear of the known, they are fantasy horror stories we invent about the unknown.

Have you been writing any horror fiction in your own life lately? Unfamiliar things you want to do or feel you should do, but there’s just so many worst case scenarios you’ve invented that you keep putting it off?

My fantasies like this are so unrealistic they wouldn’t even be good movies. I wanted to go to a Buddhist meetup, but the thought of all those new people and new situations gave me awful social anxiety. Really?! A meetup for people to work on acceptance and patience and kindness and my brain thinks this is a socially dangerous place to be? Inception made more sense than that.

The point is, these are fears of the unknown. Most people would rather know for sure the worst case scenario was losing $100 than not know if they would lose $1 or $99. The uncertainty is very uncomfortable. That’s why most people spend their time in their comfort zone, where things are predictable.

I bring all of this up just because I want you to see these two fears as separate things. Stress when you know how things might play out is fine. That’s respectful fear, it’s informed concern. But if you’re scared because it’s completely new and you don’t know what to expect, then this is a problem you can fix.

When your fear comes from uncertainty, the only path forward is to gain information. Take baby steps, research, do experiments, put yourself out there. You can prepare yourself for the worst case scenario if that makes you feel better. For most of these situations I remind myself “They can’t kill me, and they can’t eat me.” That’s true most of the time. Since you know you’ll come out alive, your worst case scenario is really just “you’ll get through it and learn something from the experience.” 

You don’t have to feel ready or prepared to do these things. For many of them that feeling will never come, so it doesn’t make sense to wait on it. My mantra for these situations is “Do it scared.” It reminds me that you can still do things when they are unfamiliar and scary. Being scared is not a reason you can’t try it. And trying it is the only way to make it less scary. How many things used to terrify you and then once you got used to them they were not’ scary at all? How many times were you shaking like a leaf as you went to an interview, on a date, to a presentation, or getting on a plane? How many of them went okay? I’m sure it’s quite a few.

Examine your life. Ask yourself what things you’re putting off or dreading just because they are unfamiliar, because you’re not sure how they will play out. What baby steps out of your comfort zone could you take to make them more familiar and take the uncertainty out of it? And if you need to just jump in and do it scared, when is the soonest you can do that? There might never be a good time. And when there’s never a good time, the best time is right now.

**Recommended Routine:** I have a spreadsheet where I log my biggest stress each day. It’s easy to ignore changes we need to make when they are unconscious, but when you see 20 consecutive rows where the same exact thing was sapping happiness from day after day, it’s harder to ignore. This habit can help you address pain points faster, and life gets a lot easier when you’re carrying less of those pain points around with you everyday.",1645103704.0

Sense of entitlement,1,sun6yw,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sun6yw/sense_of_entitlement/,1,"I grew up in a caring yet conservative family, I have got 1) beauty 2) I never struggled with money as I’ve always had everything I wanted and only couldn’t afford unnecessary luxuries *i never had to worry about real financial issues* 3) I never did chores around the house except cleaning my room and have always had a maid to do things for me. 4) I would say I am smart too. Today as an adult I am starting to worry if I have a sense of entitlement, I have always believed that I would become “something” or that I would have a great career and I would fulfill my dreams. But I always wonder, is everyone actually lucky enough to fulfill their dreams? Is it guaranteed? Does life really owe me anything? What’s the difference between me & the homeless we see in the streets? I have all those privileges not because of I deserve it but because I was lucky enough and the universe worked on my favor and won the lottery. But does that mean it will work for my favor as well in other areas? Is it guaranteed? 

For instance, in my country we have arranged marriages so I cannot go and pick the person I want to marry, it all depends on who’s proposing and whether I say yes or no, all those who proposed weren’t a good fit education-wise & financially and even in appearance and my sister keeps saying i will be old and frail with no family bc i won’t accept anyone bc these are the only options we have, am I entitled for thinking I deserve more? Do I really deserve more? 

Also job-wise, I have good chill job but it does not match with what I feel is my potential, am I too idealist and entitled for striving to have more? My sister says I’m lucky enough to have a job yet alone a job I like. Does the fact that I’m ambitious, hardworking & someone who always develop myself mean I will actually go far? Is it guaranteed that every hardworking person will have what they deserve? What’s the fine line between being ambitious and entitled?

My first couple of years were filled with lots of friends and parties, then during my Sophomore year COVID happened so I had the second half of that year and all of Junior year on distance learning. 

Gaining traction during COVID and the beginning of this Senior year a nasty rumor got spread about me by my ex Girlfriends friends, which socially did a number on me. My close friends who know me didn't care and knew it was bullshit, but for any acquaintances, potential friends, and going to the ""popular kid"" (hate that term but I don't know what else to call them) parties were all bye bye. 

My attendance this Senior year has been poor. So far I've missed 70% of classes, but with COVID and talking to my counselor the attendance itself won't mess up my graduation. Right now, in my second semester I currently have all F's 2 months in so that did a number on my grades at least. All my teachers will let me turn in late stuff with no penalty, but I can't get myself to do the work. I've been so depressed and procrastinated. Jerking off and playing video games alone at home became my solace. 

To make matters worse, I've noticed a change with my close friends throughout high school. Because I have isolated myself and haven't gone to school, other than occasional chats on discord or hanging out in person every few weeks... we've grown apart. Which wouldn't be the worst since 90% of them are a bad influence on me, but not having a single close friend is hard. I only noticed it this past couple weeks, but I am truly a loner now. 

So... why'd I write this essay? Well, it's a cry for help really. Now i'm emotionally fairly stable and not suicidal so those are not the issue for me, its more on what to do. Most of those friends I am distanced from aren't the best influence on me so I don't exactly want to rekindle the friendship with all of them, but being alone really hurts. Getting myself to work is impossible, like an invisible wall is stopping me from starting. Feels like a fear of failure so I don't want to even make the effort. 

It feels like ever since COVID my whole high school life has turned rotten. If I could go back to that first semester of Sophomore year, when I was a well known guy who had a close knit group of friends and grades that were okay but I wasn't stressed about it. Now, a lot of people have the wrong idea about me, all my good and bad friends are not really close to me at all, and I am failing my classes. I don't know how to start or how to change. Please, if you have taken the time to read any amount of this, I could use some advice.",1645073627.0

Some of us had the best times of our life, while the rest of us try to forget it. The past shouldn’t be a place where you are ashamed about, sure we may have made some mistakes, some cockups, things we shouldn’t have done etc, but this gives you the perfect opportunity to redeem yourself. 

Nobody wants to live life with shame, guilt and regret, it’s one of the worst feelings a human can endure. So, instead of living with a dark cloud of your head everyday, how about you, me and *us* turn our lives around and becoming a better you? Social media has changed how the world looks and works, people will update their statuses, chuck a filter on a photo to look better than they usually do, but is there need for it? Is there a need to try and impress others when you can simply impress yourself with how surprised you’ve changed your life around? Life isn’t a competition on who can bag themselves a better job, or a better car or how much money they get, it’s about improving the person you are today. The past is a lesson to take in and think about, but don’t stay there, it’s a good way to analyse where you’ve come from, the challenges you’ve faced, the roadblocks you’ve overcome and the barricades you’ve stormed through when you’ve felt the lowest of the low. There’s only 1 person you should strive to be better than - your past-self, the old you, the you of yesterday, last week, last year, a decade ago and so on. That’s the person you have to push everyday, to ensure that he/she doesn’t give up, doesn’t take “no” for an answer and will always strive to being a better person, improving as each day comes. 

In your head, the past can either define you or make you, and that decision is entirely your choice. I have made my decision and I hope you will have the same answer. Push yourself, motivate yourself, be your own best friend and don’t give up on becoming somebody who you’ve always wanted to be. If someone comes up to me and says “I can’t be a better me, I just can’t”, my answer will be short and simple - “why not?”. Why can’t that person be better? Why can’t that person move forward and continue with his life? Because you can, in whatever situation that you’re in, it’s possible, and it will show the amount of motivation and dedication you’ve got in you. Yes, it will be difficult, but isn’t that what life is? You’re going to be hit with difficult, soul-drenching moments, but when you’re down on the ground, there’s only 1 way you can go, and that’s up.

I would hear some words on the TV then later in the day I could read a book then a connection would be established between those words heard on the TV and those words I read and whenever I thought of what I heard it would automatically remind me of what I read that day.

I would like to better understand this phenomenon and how I could take better advantage of it in order to memorise and connect information at a greater scale.

I feel like I’m improving greatly yet remaining stagnant at the same time. Any thoughts or advice wanted.,3,su6gc9,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/su6gc9/i_feel_like_im_improving_greatly_yet_remaining/,2,"So I’m 20 years old and I’ve been on this self improvement journey for about a year. I used to be lazy, spoiled, fat, and just straight up pitiful. I was insecure as hell. I treated women like Goddesses and I was lowkey a simp. I would sit around, jerk off, eat like shit and wonder why I was a socially awkward wreck that girls didn’t want to date and most guys didn’t respect 😂

In April 2021, I dropped out of school because I didn’t feel it was right for me but I’m still a super ambitious person. I currently have a job and a side hustle, and a couple more ideas for how to make income in the works. I’ve also been working out for about a year now and I have face gains for dayyyss. Since November 2021, I’ve been working on developing a daily routine to bring order to my life. I’ve been doing NoFap and eating healthier as well as trying to incorporate reading, meditation, and other healthy habits into my life. My insecurities are also fading significantly.

That being said I can’t help but feel that despite progress, I’m still not feeling a satisfying amount of progress.  I’m still not great with girls at all and a lot of my friends don’t really respect me. I’ve improved with how I talk to girls but nobody’s stuck around. I’ve taken a more direct, yet still respectful approach to dating without going balls deep into that RedPill rabbit hole. I also find it hard to maintain the daily routine. I want to work my ass off without getting devoured by hustle culture. I’m willing to sacrifice some comfort now to have an exceptional future but I don’t want to waste my early twenties 😂 I want to be a strong and better man and not lose my soul by burning myself out into misery. 

I want to be great, I’m young as hell and greatness takes time but I feel impatient and it’s driving me a little bit crazy. I’m TWENTY! Van Gogh was way older than me when he started painting. Bezos was in his early thirties when he started Amazon. I know I’ll be great someday but again, it takes time. And time can feel sluggish and too fast at the same time.

So yeah, I guess I needed to vent a bit, tell my story and I would like to hear any advice, thoughts, or opinions anyone else may have.",1645045659.0
Discussion about responsibility,3,su5a96,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/su5a96/discussion_about_responsibility/,4,"Multiple times now I got into disagreement about the concept of responsibility. It always related to fates that were outside of my control. So what some people expected from me was taking fault for those things that I had no power over. They called this taking responsibility.

What I do is acting accordingly to the betterment of my own life and the life of others, trying to make the best out of the situations - also after events that were outside of my control. This is what I'd call responsibility.

So what is taking responsibility now? Taking blame for issues you can't control or picking up the pieces after those situations? I wouldn't know how ""wrongfully taking blame"" (as I would call it) would help anyone.",1645042641.0

I'm using this more to get my thoughts out of my mind so feel free to delete if not relevant to this sub. 

I've been sick now for almost two weeks and had a lot of time to contemplate some things. 

And there's is one thing that I realized just now. 

I'm 22(f) and I do not want to have sex. Again. 
I've had some experiences when I was younger that kind of traumatized me a little bit. 
(Trauma is such a strong word, nothing illegal happened...or no one intended for me to feel bad) 

Now ever since I'm a teenager I wanted to be like a grown up and forced myself to sleep with someone and I felt miserable afterwards. 

Then I took a step back and focused completely on myself in the following years. But I still felt like 
I should be normal and have a sex life because it does make me more mature. 

There's a guy that asked me out and just out of curiosity and for wanting to push myself a little out of my comfort zone I went on two dates with him. 

We made out pretty heavily and I enjoyed it here and there but now I don't feel like calling him back. I do not want to have sex with him. 

The only thing that I took away from this experience is that I liked knowing what everyone was talking about and I also realized that I'm pretty touch deprived. 

So I am deciding now to keep my own boundaries and not go on a third date with him. But I will seek at some cuddling events near me. Sounds weird, I know but I guess that's what I need. 

It feels good to not make the same mistake again. 
Just wanted to leave it somewhere...",1645049784.0

How do I improve my memory for social situations and conversations?,5,stxtmq,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/stxtmq/how_do_i_improve_my_memory_for_social_situations/,1,"Just for some background I'm 29 years old and have dealt with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was a shy a kid but I do remember a period of time during high school when my confidence was at its peak. I wasn't afraid of talking to randoms and just becoming friends with them, but I guess thats easier in a school environment. 

Anyways one concern I have, is that during conversation with someone I feel like my mind blanks. Even if they are the one asking me questions about things Im actually interested in, I cant think of answers! For example someone asked me recently if I watched a lot of movies, what was the last one I watched that I really liked, and my mind blanked. But I have watched a lot of movies recently!! 

It makes me sound like a bumbling idiot and a bit of a phony as well because I literally said I watch a lot of movies and then couldn't quickly recall the last one I watched.

I am in introvert and I don't have much life experience so I don't have many interesting stories up my sleeve, but when people talk about things I am aware about, for some reason I still cant contribute to the conversation.

I want to think its the social anxiety but even when I am not nervous and comfortable in someones presence, I still can't recall information and it really bothers me.

Any tips on how to improve this?",1645023324.0

I used to informatively browse the net and I became mr know it all to the point where my friends would ask me if certain things are true. Late 2014/2015 Facebook introduced Free basics and man my life changed. I started spending hours on facebook. 2016 I joined Twitter, Twitter gave me latest information (oh there was free Twitter also that time). 2017 it was Instagram etc... and 2020 Reddit. I have used almost all social media networks. 

On the upside though, my social life has suffered and I rarely leave my room. I'd be in my room scrolling through social media mindlessly and I don't get hungry, pee etc... I don't even chat with friends anymore I just scroll through the feed. I mean the happiest days of my life are before 2016 after that I have been on autopilot. 

In 2019 I started college and failed terribly because I just couldn't study. Studying wasn't interesting and the only thing that made sense was Surfing the net. As a result I really struggle to focus on activities and having reasons to do activities. e.g I have drivers license and there's an unused car at home. I'm supposed to be using it, but I don't and when people ask me why don't I drive? I have no response. Last year I went back to college and I passed the semester however I was in my dorm all the time. I just realized today that there's a balcony here. I know no one here and guys have actually asked why they never see me? 

 but all in all I want to have a life and not sit in my room scrolling through social media mindlessly all day. And actually have a life and things to look forward to.

tips on how to build my self esteem,2,su3bxm,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/su3bxm/tips_on_how_to_build_my_self_esteem/,1,"Hello, first time poster in this sub. 

I (f/25) have been working on myself the past two years. I escaped an abusive codependent relationship and went to therapy. I am being treated for Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD and I am putting in the work every day to heal. I am also 1,052 days clean, and have made it a point to stay single the past two years so I can really focus on myself and my son. As well as healing, and learning how to be comfortable being alone. 

Recently, I have started talking to someone new, and he is great so far. very kind, respectful, funny, and driven. The only thing is, I find myself getting anxious and doubting my own self worth whenever he's busy and can't respond right away. Mentally, I know this is silly. So I don't react, and I reassure myself that I am over reacting and anxious, and people do not owe me every second of their attention and time. Short of keeping my anxiety at bay, I feel like I am not really fixing the issue, as I am not getting to the root of what makes me feel this way. I assume it is rooted in my anxious attachment style. I would love if any of you have any helpful EBT tools, or self help literature I can utilize to help me figure this out.

It’s been almost a year since I went no contact on my former online FWB. Not sure where to go from here.,1,su8248,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/su8248/its_been_almost_a_year_since_i_went_no_contact_on/,0,"Despite cutting off contact with her in April, I spent most of last year detoxing myself from her by removing all conversations, blocking her on social media, and removing her name and comments wherever possible on my posts. I avoided dating for a while after this because I wasn’t having much luck with dating apps to the point where I ended up unintentionally using another person (who was actually interested) as my first girlfriend despite having platonic feelings for her because she was the safest bet. I now realize that this was very selfish of me and unfair to her.

We met in the summer of 2020, but after that, in the fall of that year, this dynamic was an absolute mess and I only wish that back then I had the self-respect that I do now to cut her off sooner. After I cut off contact, I got vaccinated against COVID, I finished college, I got an internship which turned into a job, and I started living on my own for the first time. Despite all of this though, my brain didn’t want to move on and was stuck in the past for a while.

I’m approaching the anniversary of the day I ended things with her once and for all, and I feel like my quality of life has improved. Maybe not dramatically, but it’s definitely been better since I kicked her out of my life. I’m still not sure if I’m ready to date, but I’m making an effort to work out more frequently, and I want to improve my personality as well. The next time I get into a relationship, I don’t want it to be out of desperation or “because everyone else is doing it,” or “because nobody else is giving me attention.”

Whatever happens in the future for me dating-wise, I’m going to be much more careful in choosing who I share personal things with. I do know that I haven’t been devoting as much energy to thinking about her as before, and I believe that work is distracting me from doing so.

I did also start a self-esteem workbook last night, hopefully this will get me to a point where I can truly love myself.",1645049867.0
Taking a gap year for my mental health,11,strn59,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/strn59/taking_a_gap_year_for_my_mental_health/,3,"Hi all! Im 22f, just graduated last year and was preparing for my master's abroad for nearly a year! I even got into numerous universities in UK (I'm from India) and now that it's coming to leaving, I've grown to have second thoughts- I've been going to therapy for anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Also, I feel very confused with which direction to even take my career- there are so many unexplored options! Other than that, life is chaotic and I'm someone who always strives for perfection and efficiency in my life. I've been an A-grade student and put blood, sweat and tears into my admissions.  (GRE- iykyk😭) And seeing everyone getting jobs and earning doesn't help!

So now after talking to my therapist and my mom - they both say (and some part of me agrees) that it's best to take it slow, get a job, and do my master's after a year. This is hard for me to accept because what about my hard work? What about the money we put into the university applications? What face do i show friends & family when I say I'm not going? 

Now maybe this sounds trivial, but it's been hard for me to put ME infront of everything - to make me a priority. Just wanted to express that it's never a wrong thing to put your mental health first.

How do I eat better and more often?,1,su7bs1,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/su7bs1/how_do_i_eat_better_and_more_often/,7,"Trigger warning: food issues

I come seeking some advice about how to have a better relationship with food. I hate eating, and sometimes forget about it altogether. Not because of body image issues or anything, it just feels time consuming and lackluster to say the least. I don’t ever really love the taste of food, though rarely I do enjoy it some. I’m also very picky and would rather not eat than eat something that doesn’t sound good, so eating vegetables can be challenging at times. 

There are some outside factors that go along with this. I grew up in extreme poverty (in US standards) with a neglectful mother, so growing up I ate malt o meal, scrambled eggs, and ramen. When she felt inclined to cook, I had hamburger helper. That’s it. Sometimes, none of that was even available, so I just didn’t eat for extended periods of time. I had fish for the first time when I was around 12, and I still need to Google what certain vegetables are when they pop up in a recipe. It’s definitely frustrating. 

I also despise cooking. It takes up so much time, requires so many dishes, and in the end I’m not even that satisfied, regardless of whether the food tastes good or not.

On top of all that, I have a plethora of mental health issues including bipolar disorder, depression, and inattentive ADHD. So basically, everything feels like a chore always.

How can I improve my relationship with food? How can I go about eating more? Sometimes I don’t even realize it’s been over 24 hours since I’ve eaten until I start shaking and feeling faint. Even then, I don’t feel hungry, I just logically come to the conclusion that it’s probably time to eat.",1645047945.0

We are both student workers at a restaurant on our college campus. He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. For the first several months, we would talk frequently. At first, I was the one always having to initiate the conversation, so I stopped. I only stopped for a day, though. That day, I said good morning to him when I came in, goodbye when I left, and I'd talk to him for work related stuff, but I didn't go out of my way to speak to him about trivial things. The next day, he came right up to me and started talking to me. He started initiating for a while then.

At work, he would frequently help me, even when I didn't ask for help. For example, we were both at the registers when one of my customers ordered a beer. Even though he already had his own customers, without even asking, he got a beer out from the fridge and opened it for me. There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. I figured what better way to show him that I'm interested than by inviting him? I messaged him on Instagram. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. I never knew what I was going to get with him. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager.

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been acting somewhat back to normal again. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly like before. Today, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. Today is Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers. I'm confused, because on one hand, his distant behavior should speak for itself, but on the other hand, he shows me a bunch of signs that he likes me.",1645040307.0

It went from wanting to keep people interested in me because I faced so much rejection from kids my age when I little and suddenly when I told someone some particularly juicy detail of my life they were interested in talking to me ( at age 13).
But it wasn't enough after a while. I still wasn't getting the attention of the people I wanted attention from so I became sad and distant and refused to tell anyone what's bothering me because I tried that once and my feelings immediately got dismissed by the people i confided in.
I somehow got out of it when I was 16 and actually expressed what bothers me and the friend listened and said it's valid and then fucking went on to do exactly what I said was making me upset and it broke my heart.
Then I discovered the attention and validation I got from social media and got addicted and started over sharing everything in my life to people who didn't know me and probably didn't want to either but the juicy tit bits were interesting. It was just gossip to them and validation for me. 
Now even that isn't making me feel better. I'm just depressed but also super anxious about mundane things  and feel stressed all the time. I'm in therapy but it's a slow process. I only get 1 hour per week which doesn't seem enough to cover everything I want currently.

How can I (18 F) become a healthy individual?,2,sttd31,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sttd31/how_can_i_18_f_become_a_healthy_individual/,4,"I recognise that I am a very unhealthy person and have been one my entire life and I finally want to change for good. I am very sensitive and passive-aggressive, play the victim all the time, blame others for my problems, have extremely low self esteem, only look for fun and do not like any kind of discomfort, do not think about my future and am very disconnected from the reality. I give up everything I start and have no goals and passion at all. I am not assertive at all and always try to avoid any kind of confrontation. I have very unhealthy coping mechanisms and stay in denial about situations all the time. I can't think straight and form opinions.

I do things for attention all the time. Even if I am really down and think about killing myself, the first thing I think about is the pain it would bring others. I know it's really, really fucked up.


The thing is that I have picked up many of these traits from my parents so I have no one to look upto and guide me through things. I realise that I am ruining my life since I am not working towards having a good career, nor am I capable of forming good relationships. 

I really, really want to change for better but have no one to guide me and don't know where and how to start. I don't want to end up like my parents and really want to turn my life around. I am scared that I will give up again but changing really is a necessity for me at this point.",1645009726.0

However, since a few months I keep falling into this competitive mindset where I compare myself to the success of other coaches in my niche who are ( or seem to be) ahead of me.

It has reached a point where I work to be better than them and try to prove my worth rather than working to provide massive value and follow my purpose. This is also weakening my creativity, usually powerful empathy and ability to relate to others.

I have done A LOT already nearly every day since 2020 — meditation, affirmations, visualization, 'not giving up', using self doubt as fuel to take even more action, help from mentoring, improving my sales skills, taking breaks, right positioning, but I am not satisfied with the results I have gotten so far.

•

And here’s another thing.
Through visualization practices I became aware of this self image problem where when I visualize ideal outcomes just to gain more clarity, my subconscious self image basically tells me

'You are not good enough for this. Your services dont work. Other coaches are a lot better than you and you don’t deserve the same level of success. Just give up‘

In highschool I finally found myself friends, friends that I love spending time with and I would not trade them for anything, I also managed to get myself a girlfriend on some miracle recently so that is also a plus.

So why can't I be happy. Well, what I end up doing everyday is comparing myself to friends, how every one of them has a hobby or a trait that makes them unique to the group, while I have nothing. One plays the guitar, one is into photography, one is a gym enthusiast and if I were to introduce anyone to the group I could just say those things. But how would someone introduce me. A not so smart friend, that doesn't have a hobby or any interests in general apart from videogames, but that is basically it. And so comparing myself to my friends I feel like complete shit, till the point I hate how they have at least something going for them and then I realize that I think like that about my beloved friends and I start to hate myself even more. And since I got a girlfriend, all day all I think about is how she is so amazing that I don't deserve her, to the point where every second I am scared that she will just leave me for someone better that me.

I tried doing a lot of sports, hobbies, even got myself drums to force myself to play, but nothing worked. I would put in months of hard work into a thing and either I did not enjoy the thing or I was so shit after so many hours spent that I just felt like a waste of space.

I've read a lot of advice just telling me that others don't think about me as much as I do, they're all thinking about themselves. And yeah, that was nice to hear because it does make sense. But that doesn't suddenly invigorate me with self-esteem. Ove the years I've grown shameful of myself.

I found you!"" but the discomfort and confusion on their face when I open my mouth to speak says it all. I hate shopping at stores where customer service is hunting me down to ask me if I need any help. I hate checking out anywhere with no self checkout. I hate eating at sit-down restaurants. Not because of the experience but because they force me to speak. And I'm working on the voice, but the shame shows up there too. If my roommate is home I will not do my voice training. Even though I'm out to them, it's embarrassing. I'm ashamed. I don't feel like I have ever felt like I belong, especially since transitioning.

This was probably one of my most insane days. I was writing records all night and slept for only 2 hrs. Survived the next day till 10 PM while going to school and a birthday party. Won't be sharing any experience for now but here is what I learnt from this insane days


- Don't way lesser sleep than needed, ever. Because one moment of being tired and aloof is all you need to mess up almost anything.

That does not mean you should sleep more than needed either, listen to your body (not your excuses for sleeping) and choose the right sleep time for yourself.

...

- Be Proactive, always. If you know there is something you have to complete for sure just do it ASAP. You never know when things can turn upside down.

...

- Read all your friend's messages carefully. One message not being read properly is all you need for a misunderstanding. Right communication is one of those things whose importance is realised when you fuck it up.

...

- A fun game is all you need to introduce to make the social environment better.

...

- Don't confuse willpower and drive with not taking rest. It will just backfire. When you **need** rest it's fine to take it. 

This doesn't apply if your ass is already on the line btw. Unless you can save yourself by getting enough rest.

...

- All you need is the right motivation or reason to instantly boost your willpower or ability to get things done.

...

- Sticking with your daily practices and work that will provide results in the future or provide benifits the more consistently it's done *even* when you don't feel like it. That ability can change your life. Achieve it through practice.

...

- Make the best of each moment when you are with family or anyone that might matter. Life is fragile... Too fragile.

It does not mean you put your work behind for it. Decide what is important for you in life. Balance? Success? Relationships? And make your choice.

*Drum rolls*

Crazy that you made it all the way here. This is just a way for me to not write my journal while not missing out on the benifits of reflection. Quite selfish tbh.

But when it came to moving from acquaintances to friendship, or maintaining a connection with a long-time friend, I was having horrible anxiety. My closest friend of five years, I would spend 20 minutes agonizing over a text message. I'd read it over and over again, so sure that auto correct would jumble things as soon as I sent it or maybe I thought it sounded alright, but she would receive it poorly. I didn't want to tell her anything that was going on in my personal life. I thought she would think of me as boring or I assumed the worst that she would judge me. This started happening with people I worked with at the retail store. I quit a few months ago and recently went back to see everyone. I talked with six different people, they said it was good to see me, one person literally said we're friends, and my initial thought was that everyone was just ""being nice"" and that's what you do in social situations. I realized that the anxiety and doubting everyone was actually a me problem. 

I met with a therapist online, only four sessions, but the tools she gave me helped. We didn't dive in too deeply, but she gave me worksheets to do, how to challenge my thoughts, we talked about shame. Most importantly, I decided I would ignore the anxious thoughts and just text my friends and believe what people tell me. I opened up more to my long time friend and I made plans with other people. No surprise, nothing bad happened like I thought. Going forward, I'm paying attention to how I feel when I share details about my life, when I text people, how often I feel ashamed for feeling a certain way or choices I make. 

I've even avoided things like this, doing anything online because I didn't want anyone to say anything mean to me, like a post is too long, or I made a grammatical mistake, or what I'm saying isn't relatable or interesting to anyone else. 

So thanks for reading! What do you do when what you're feeling isn't helpful or even real, so to speak. Obviously the anxiety I was feeling was real, but didn't hold up when I questioned the validity of the thoughts.",1644977571.0

I have a very unhealthy habit of distracting myself by browsing social media instead of doing things that I should be doing. I feel like it is a mixture of avoidance and procrastination. I think I have social anxiety for as long as I can remember and probably a little bit depressed (which, I hate to self diagnose but I can't really look for mental diagnosis right now due to personal circumstances). 

For example, I graduated last year and have only spent 3 months in an internship since. I'm supposed to be looking for a job right now but because I am so overwhelmingly terrified by the process of applying, interviews and fitting in the workplace that every time I try to start applying, I immediately switch to distractions because it is soothing. I also had a bad interview where the interviewers basically laughed at me, so that amplifies my fear even further. 

The same thing also happens when I try to do self improvement, like reading the news. My attention span is so bad that the most time I can spend on doing this is 5-10 minutes max.

I did consider deleting all my social media apps but I don't want to feel like a caveman, so what should I do?

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

But due to our past experience, our childhood and experiences, it's difficult to manifest those thoughts as a reflex action.

This becomes frustrating over the period of time. Especially when you have come to realize, the person who is at loss is you. Not only do you end up spending the best time of your life worrying but maybe not achieving your true potential.

Might sound cringe, but having a background sound of positive affirmation does help. You can select the theme you want - positive affirmation about health, life or even wealth. Just make it consistent and you will also be relieved.

Since I was a teenager i had hyperthyroidism. I am taking meds for it, it's easy to gain weight and adding tot hat I sometimes had mood swings. Wake up happy and motivated, go to work, wanting to cry, an hour later I'm fine. After a week i would be fine and stable again.

2020 i was in an unhealthy relationship which led to me being diagnosed with depression and feeling well...depressed. intense rumination and mood swings

2021 we broke up, it helped me a lot and i felt better. Still mood swings, less rumination. I didn't look for a relationship but met someone who is wonderful and we came together and yeah. He's a good guy. We are compatible and i feel very good with him.

However, when I slipped into depression, i had string ruminations and after my health got better it turned into ruminations and mood swings.

Looking back a few months i can see some progress but these mood swings come back every time and especially now since I'm decreasing my depression medication (Lexapro) a little bit, they are hitting hard.

I can wake up happy, an hour later i slip into a deep hole of rumination, feeling worthless, bad, questioning my relationship, ruminating, thinking how there is no future for the relationship and how i just want to be alone and...not do anything.

This may last a few hours and suddenly, for no reason i feel great. I'm optimistic. I don't worry. I don't question anything. I'm....me.

So hence the question. How do I start *wanting* to improve and actually doing things, rather than just sitting there and not doing anything?

When unwanted things happen in our lives, we give large value to these negative or bad situations. Yet, we give very tiny value – or completely dismiss *any* value we might have assessed – to the small, incidental or ordinary good things in our lives. 

We tend to *overvalue* the negative. And we tend to *undervalue* the kindness of strangers and the people in our everyday lives who we take for granted. 

Assigning a value is about showing us where we’re projecting someone else’s frustration into our lives. And helping us recognize where we aren’t valuing the daily precious moments that fill our lives. 

So take a minute and begin to truly value what happens in your life. And make sure *everything* receives a value. What could each and every moment of your life – each and every interaction – be worth to you? ",1644961842.0

I was the silent one and I was being allotted simple tasks.

Now, I don't criticise much but the day before the event, my teacher expelled two students because of ""attendance issues and bad academics."" I objected that this month was our last month in high school and that the students are indeed well-behaved. The teacher agreed but said, ""You students never realise our position.""

Now, the event went smoothly with nothing in my control and later in the heads' group on WhatsApp, the teacher thanked everyone by tagging others. She tagged me and said, ""Thank you for criticising everything we did.""

Living in the present means to stay as much as you can with attention centered in the heart and scanning and following the signals of your soul, which are never misleading. Making plans for the future is a play of the mind, which believes is in charge and as we all know is often wrong.

One of the favorite sayings of my spiritual guide is:

""Humans plan their lives and what does God do? - He laughs!""

Suffice to say that human planning sometimes succeeds, PROVIDED it coincided with the godly plan.

As God's (or Higher Intelligence) plan is running permanently and without any interruption in our best interests, it is very fulfilling and rewarding to comply with the signals coming from our heart.

I've been doing very satisfactorily for 20 days. 1 day less than what some say form a habit. In these 20 days I've been studying around 8 hrs a day (with an efficiency and retention like never before), reading 3 books concurrently, enjoying life and the freedom that being disciplined and not doing harmful actions (like gaming) bring.

However, on day 21 I slipped into the pit of binge gaming. This lasted for 3 days. I have been feeling really unhappy during these 3 days, except the very beginning 2 hours that I had a bit of fun. It felt I was so compelled and bound by this binging. 

In my binge gaming, I basically ignored everything except gaming. I stayed up just to keep playing, I put my assignments aside and even though I was quite ahead of the teaching due to my efficient 20 days, I feel like gradually falling back.

The cue is nothing more than me having to pull out my gaming laptop to test out some programs for my friend. Normally I store it in a closet and I could resist playing in the past, although not that productive because I'd still waste time on social media and youtube. However in the 20 days I had been extremely productive without doing any of those mistakes.

What makes me hate myself is me being unable to stop myself midway in the binging. I'd say it's not limited to games only but I can binge on shows, although it'd usually be way less detrimental because I seldom stay up watching shows and I could pull myself out more easily from it.

I don't think I can completely avoid another binging in the future, I've tried to many times in the past but one binging was all it took to turn my mood, conditions around and possibly ruin my progress heavily, even if I'd been maintaining things well normally.

I want to be able to stop myself when I'm about to do such detrimental binging or when I'm doing it. I've seen techniques like taking some deep breaths or meditating for a few mins before doing. But honestly when one was really about do it, they'd put all these techniques aside at that moment and it was how they fell. 

I want to be more resilient, let's say I start gaming but I only waste one hour then I can control myself to stop and cut loss from there. 

Also, at this stage of my life I'm not really into gaming. I find it in the essence very boring, repetitive, and not mind stimulating as much as academic work. I had way more fun and felt very happy when studying and reading.

Why do I still feel so miserable even though I've gotten my life in order?,3,sssgki,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sssgki/why_do_i_still_feel_so_miserable_even_though_ive/,8,"First and foremost I don't mean to brag or put down anyone else's experiences with depression and loneliness. I acknowledge that most people on this subreddit aren't nearly as lucky as I am to be where I am now but I don't know where else to talk about this and figured this would be the best place for it given how its been helpful back when my life was a lot worse.

I'm 17 and a senior in high school right now. 2 years ago I was so miserable about the fact that my friends hated me (justifiably, I was a bad friend and very annoying) and I was seen as weird and wasted all my time doing stupid shit like playing video games and mindlessly scrolling and arguing online. The breaking point was halloween 2 years ago when I saw all my friends were hanging out together on snapchat and I was really upset that I was left out of it. I started seeing the school counselor for help and I was making steps towards improvement until COVID came halfway through sophomore year. Although that time was really suffering for my social isolation and missing out on high school, I managed to come out of it a better person and made amends with my friends and had a better summer than I had before.

Fast forward to today, I've been doing everything that I felt like was a dream for me 2 years ago. I hang out with my friends almost all the time, have worked multiple jobs, feel good about my college applications, have good grades, and I no longer feel out of place or anything. I've gotten everything I've wanted but it just doesn't feel like enough.

I don't understand this constant misery I still feel in spite of everything being so good. It's like this looming dread. Like something bad will happen, that I'm gonna lose it all suddenly. Every good moment feels bittersweet because it feels like its gonna be taken from me soon. Why the hell do I feel this way? Why can't I just enjoy the good things I have now without constantly feeling like its gonna be taken from me?",1644893416.0

The Secret Of A Great Relationship/Marriage,0,ssxotx,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssxotx/the_secret_of_a_great_relationshipmarriage/,2,"Great relationships and marriages where kindness and joy seem to be infinite, where smiles seem to be everlasting, and where the connection between the man and the woman seems to be ripped out of a fairy tale are the kind of connections most people want to share with the world. 

But have you ever wondered why many of the relationships that do their best to maintain such a perfect image break? Were you ever curious to know, why some marriages last until death, and although the smiles are not everlasting and the joy is not infinite, these partners seem to have a depth in their eyes that appears to have touched both heaven and hell? And is there something else that makes a great relationship last, something besides the pill filled with kindness and joy, smiles and purity, perfection, and constant love that you are being fed everywhere?

To be able to have an objective answer for such questions, you need to understand, that there is no such thing as a relationship without conflict. If you were to ask every couple about one true marital fact, many will tell you that each of their partner's qualities that first attracted them to each other have somehow transformed into the sources of conflict later on in their relationship. 

If you, as a man, will be attracted to your spouse by her warmth of heart and empathy at some future point you will redefine these traits as a way of relating to others that is a bit too intrusive. At the same time, the woman that fell in love with you dearly because of your reliability, predictability, and the sense of security that you offered her, will condemn these qualities in you as dull and boring.

Even though they are the same and identical qualities that created the initial attraction, they are also a source of conflicts in the later phases of a relationship. Besides this, both you and your loved one will come into the relationship with a bag of demons that are buried so deep into your unconscious that you don’t even know about them anymore. The moments that break relationships are moments of tension when such demons resurface and partners will refuse to use the necessary tools to solve the issues, will throw the blame onto their significant other, and eventually, break up.

You will see often suggestions that tell you that you have to calmly discuss, as loving partners, your dark elements when you encounter them, to have a goody-goody chit-chat of understanding, the so-called “I’m-okay-you’re-okay” discussion that unfortunately seems to only push the problems under the rug. 

Keep in mind that in these moments, when your insecurities, developed because of your father’s abandonment, or her insecurities created by her mother’s indifference surface, when scars from the past are reopened and start bleeding on the inside, relationships either break or get stronger. 

The answer to the question ”why do some marriages last until death?” is to be found in the way these situations are resolved.

You see, talking and calmly empathizing with your loved one will not always work and when deep scars are reopened, when demons from the past resurface, you have to sometimes scream, slam doors, break a coffee table, smash a TV to be able to even begin to have the words to describe what is eating you. Sometimes, meditation won’t be enough. Sometimes, things just need to be shaken and if you are afraid of breaking things, within and without, the only thing that will break is your relationship.

A strong marriage is the unbreakable among all the things that have been broken. Marriage is the thing left after the earthquake of emotions and despair is gone. Marriage is the union that helps two people discover what they don’t know about each other, but also what they don’t know about themselves.

Accept this fact and do not mask it under the false pretense of perfection. When things get rough, let it all out and see what is left in the morning because sometimes, the only way to not be haunted by the scars of the past, is to bring them to the surface, feel their pain once more, and deal with them, many times in a not so nice way.

Keep in mind that strong relationships also embrace forgiveness. To learn to forgive is to break the unforgiving past, but remember that forgiveness is not a passive action as you might believe. It does not mean that you turn the other cheek quietly and forget about it. 

Forgiveness is a promise that you, as the one asking for it, make, to work on the misfortunes that consume you and do your best to resolve them and a great marriage is the platform that gives all concerned the opportunity to forgive, even if sometimes when you are trying to break through the darkest demons and scars inside you, some dishes and furniture might go in the process.

Remember that both you and the woman that you love are full of demons, and if you are getting married to try to make yours go away, ignoring them altogether, you will only end up marrying your darkness to someone else’s darkness, and you will bleed together and call that love.

All of us, you, me the woman that you love, and every other person on this planet are full of demons and scars, some of them smaller some of them bigger. When you decide to commit to a relationship, when you decide to get married and build a family, your demons will come with you and so do the demons of your significant other.

With time your demons will appear, and you will start hearing a distant scream, a forgotten pain triggered by a small event that should have passed by unnoticed. The same can happen with all your loved ones and out of the blue, you will find yourself desperately fighting with each other over things that make no sense, while having a level of anger, anxiety, and pain that you cannot explain, or are too afraid to.

Keep in mind that in a lasting relationship, although these encounters seem to happen compulsively and accidentally, this level of activity is recognized by both partners as a quest to better understand each other and if you engage in such a relationship this will be part of the responsibility you have for yourself and for the one you love.

The answer for a great relationship that only death can break is to be found within the two lovers that embrace forgiveness and who are not afraid to explore and challenge each other’s inner demons and scars, fighting them, making them talk, running from them, falling in love with some, hating other, embracing some, hanging other in each other’s closet and dealing with them together when they suddenly erupt with such a force as to shake the foundation of their relationship.

Never forget that great things will always require effort, and even though it seems that marriage will bring pain and suffering with it, the pain and suffering are already there, consuming you while you have no name for it, devouring you while you have no understanding of it and masked by you because you have no heart or are to blind to look at it alone. 

A great marriage can provide the platform to look deeper into your darkness and finally have some answers for the demons that lurk in your closet and if you wonder if it is worth it to commit your life to such a challenge if you doubt that you can pull this through, remember this:

Trust and loyalty between two people is built in the darkest moments, when both of you, no matter what, stay together and face the demons that haunt you, bold enough to share the honest truth and kind enough to have the heart to forgive and rebuild the damage that the storms of the past create.

To know 100% that no matter what, at least one soul in this world will be next to you, through thick and thin, is one of the greatest elements of human experience and if you want it in your life, if you want to experience a relationship bond that only death can break, you will need the courage to face the darkness, fearlessness to accept your weakness and a loving heart to embrace forgiveness.

When your relationship will face the demons of the past, when your marriage will open up the scars from yesterday, will you be driven by fear and ego and break up, or will you have the guts to look into the darkness, the will to face it and the kindness and love in your heart to forgive?

A great relationship means battling together the elements both of you fear the most. Will you stand for your love or will you feed your fears and walk away?

Your choice will have half the answer for an unbreakable bond.

All the best to you, reader!",1644911581.0

Well, considering that my sister and I fought a lot when we were kids and she would bully me in ableist ways, that my parents recommend me to take AP classes when I didn’t want to because of stress, the relentless harassment k get to become a Christian again after I deconverted , homophobia, and ableist beliefs that I didn’t look like I have autism because I didn’t act autistic and that means I’m cured…… this is fucking why. 

But my sister is pissed at me anyway and she thinks I’m an asshole.

So maybe I’m wrong about it and I’m just a leech on my parents finances just to get what I want, to get the latest iPhone tech and jackets and stuff. And ask for favors such as moving me into a private dorm and stuff.

"Yesterday Is History, Tomorrow Is A Mystery, Today Is A Gift",5,ssocgg,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssocgg/yesterday_is_history_tomorrow_is_a_mystery_today/,0,"….**this is why it’s called “*the present*”**. 

Make the most of today. We’ve been given another chance, another opportunity in life, to turn things around, to make ourselves a better person, to make wiser decision, be kind to others and to prove to yourself that you’re worth. 

Stay locked and focus on **today**, not yesterday, last week or last year. That’s gone, that’s done, that chapter of your life is finished, whether it was good or bad, whether you made mistakes or you were perfect, that was then, that’s history, that’s the past, that’s behind you - focus on who you are and what you’re going to do **today**. 

Thinking back into the past or fearing what the future will bring is a mental way of holding yourself back. **Look forward, not backwards**. You may not like the person you were was, but you’re not that person today, you’ve learned, you’ve grown, you’re much wiser and better person - that’s what looking forward does, you move with it and by doing so, you learn new things you once didn’t know, you experience moments you never thought you’d have and you learn valuable new lessons in life. 

You’ve got to out everything behind you and focus on the present, the gift that we receive everyday we open our eyes in the morning. Bad things happen, bad mistakes were made, bad things were said, but you can’t change it, there’s not a reverse button in life, you must take it into your grasp and learn from it, more importantly, grow with it. 

Keep pushing yourself, don’t ever take “*failure*” as an answer, slap it in the face and rise above it. You have 2 options when you fail or commit a mistake, you either:

- let it take over your life, thus not allowing you to move forward and living your life in constant fear 
- you learn from this/these experiences, you take it on the chin, accept it and move forward with your life with greater knowledge and lessons learnt 

Please, don’t continue to beat yourself up, you’ve done it for far too long, it’s time for a change, I know and you know it. You’ve stumbled in life on countless of occasions, you’ve cried yourself to sleep, you’ve felt alone, you’ve felt fear and you constantly overthink, but listen and listen good… you’re still here, you’ve battled your own demons and scars you constantly come out on top. What does that show? You’re strong, powerful and determined to be better and to prove to nobody but yourself that you can carry yourself out of the darkest of pits. 

I’m so proud of you.",1644881677.0
Valentine’s Day Isn’t the Only Day About Love,9,ssihuf,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssihuf/valentines_day_isnt_the_only_day_about_love/,3,"When I was in my early 20s for Valentine’s Day, my partner gave me chocolates, a card and fabulous artwork to celebrate. I honestly thought they nailed it because Valentine’s day is a day where you give stuff to people to show your love. I’ve seen it modeled on TV and in stories over and over. I was flattered that they spent so much money on me but I also didn’t feel “loved” by it.

There was a much more deeply rooted love that was supposed to ignite.

But it didn’t.

Later into our relationship, the lack of sparks became a problem that neither of us knew how to fix. We were both unhappy.

Have you ever had this happen to you?

Have you received a gift or gesture from someone that didn’t have a desired impact but you didn’t know why?

OR

Have you done things for others that you thought would make them feel loved, accepted and appreciated but these gestures didn’t have the impact you thought?

If you said yes, you may have found yourself resentful towards friends, family or partners and wondered why they never seem happy with your efforts.

Of course you’d be frustrated, resentful and want to give up like I did. It’s not your fault that you don’t know what to do. We’ve been taught that we must treat them how we want to be treated and everything will work out.

But that’s just false.

I discovered something else.

* I must *not* treat them how I want to be treated.
* I must *not* treat them how I *think* they want to be treated.
* I must treat them how they *actually want to be treated*!

I found that for me and my relationships and friendships, the core of the problem was that I couldn’t do what would make someone feel loved, accepted and appreciated because I didn’t know what to do! And I didn’t know what to do because we never actually talked about specific actions.

My friend, it could be that you may not have a clear understanding of what makes your friends, family or partners feel loved.

Again, it’s not your fault. We’ve not been taught how to have these conversations.

And having these conversations are difficult because we might not know what questions to ask or how to answer them. And that’s OK.

It takes deliberate effort to learn it through examining your experiences, journaling, meditation and truthful conversation.

When you discover specific actions your partners, your friends or acquaintances can do to make YOU feel loved AND you can clearly communicate them, you will develop healthy loving relationships.

Valentine’s Day isn’t the only day about love. Everyday can be a day to discover, show and appreciate love.

How Your Past Becomes Your Future And How You Can Change It!,9,ssep9m,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssep9m/how_your_past_becomes_your_future_and_how_you_can/,1,"I want to share Keka’s story and how **Joe’s Dispenza** work helped me understand how personalised self-talk audio influenced Keka’s body and mind.

One of the things that we ask in our self-talk form is the emotion people feel when talking negatively to themselves. **Her name is Keka** and she told us she **feels fear, shame, sadness.**

Now considering the science of how our past becomes our futurre by **Joe Dispenza** this is what happens in Keka’s body when she talks negatively about herself or feels the emotions of fear, shame and sadness. Accordingly to Joe Dispenza.

1. **When you think a thought** (or have a memory), **a biochemical reaction begins in your brain** causing the brain to release certain chemical signals.
2. These chemical signals **make your body feel exactly the way you were just thinking**.
3. Once you notice you are feeling a particular way, then you generate more thoughts equal to how you’re feeling, and then **you release more chemicals** from your brain to make you feel the way you’ve been thinking.

For example when Keka has a fearful thought, she starts to feel fear. The moment she feels fear, that emotion influences her to think more shameful thoughts, and those thoughts trigger the release of even more chemicals in the brain and body that make you continue to feel more fear.

1. The next thing you know, **she is caught in a loop where your thinking creates feeling and your feeling creates thinking**.
2. Wiring the same circuits in your brain over and over again.

Keka keeps thinking the same thoughts, **she is hardwiring her brain into the same patterns**. As a result, her brain become an artifact of her past thinking.

Accordinly to Joe Dispenza:

When you start to think about your problems, **those problems**—which are connected to the memories of past experiences of different people or things at certain times and places—**create familiar feelings such as unhappiness, futility, sadness, pain, grief, anxiety, worry, frustration, unworthiness, or guilt.** If those emotions are driving your thoughts, and you cannot think greater than how you feel, then you are also thinking in the past.

This thinking-feeling loop also produces a measurable electromagnetic field that surrounds our physical bodies. To better understand that **think of emotions as energy in motion.** When someone experiencing a strong emotion walks into a room, their energy (aside from their body language) is often very palpable.

So if we are re-creating the past day after day, thinking the same thoughts and feeling the same emotions, **we are broadcasting the same electromagnetic field over and over again**—sending out the same energy with the same message.

From the perspective of energy and information, this means the same energy of our past continues to carry the same information, which then keeps creating the same future.

**Our energy, then, is essentially equal to our past**. The only way we can change our lives is to change our energy—to change the electromagnetic field we are constantly broadcasting.

In other words, to change our state of being, we have to change how we think and how we feel.

That’s what we do with personalised self-talk audios at selftalk(dot)space. Keka’s audio is based on her relationship with her body, her relationship with her emotions, motherhood, being a wife and having a career. Pretty intense if you would ask me, and definitely worth the 5h work for her script.",1644856238.0

So recently i just started a new job at a new company last week. And after the work week, when he weekends came. When it was supposed to be a time for me to unload and relax, i just felt an utter lack of interest in anything. I didn't know what to do during the weekends. I just played a game mindlessly for hours without even feeling any excitement or fun. I felt tired and lost. I felt that if this goes on, i would eventually be unable to sustain myself in my work and my mental state will keep deteriorating.

Not sure if this makes sense to anyone but i do hope i can find some advice or help here.

Thank you.",1644844931.0

Frustrated.,2,ssjfw8,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssjfw8/frustrated/,1,"I've been doing self-improvement for a year and a half now. I've doing doing nofap on and off for this whole time and my longest streak was like 6 months, with some peaks here and there.

I still am not happy, but I think I am happier than before. I still have little to no friends and I still haven't approached any girl in my life. I still spend hours in the front of my computer every single day (most of it is work stuff but a lot of it is watching YouTube videos, using Discord and playing video games) and I go outside with my only friend like twice a week. I still have bad gym days, I still feel lonely and I know I feel bad for not having the balls to approach people. But I want to better myself, and that's why I'm doing this. I don't read any books, I don't find them appealing, I do not do journaling but I keep track of how good my days were in an Excel file and make notes about why the days were bad / good, I've learned a lot of stuff from doing that. I've been living in Germany for about 6 years and even though I can speak german, I'm still making mistakes and I have a hard time making german conversations, because I have no idea what to say. Making friends is even harder. I'm currently at my peak and I'm the best looking version of myself. I have a pretty good looking body and I haven't missed a workout in 2 years. But I know that's not enough, the grind never stops, I still have lots of things to improve and I'm sure I will manage to do it.. but how?

I originally had more stuff to say, but for some reason I find it difficult to explain what's going on inside my brain. I'm pretty frustrated with myself and that's why I'm posting this.

I will post an update in like 6 months.. if I remember.

He knows I have issues with anger. I have amped up my psych sessions because I want to be on his level and want to be able to control and feel my anger and not show it the way I normally do. 

Last night I thought I broke the vacuum cleaner and was nearly going to break it trying to fix it and getting so angry inside. I stopped. I walked downstairs and asked my boyfriend to help me. I watched him fiddle with it for ten minutes when eventually it popped back into place. I said thank you and kissed him. And continued vacuuming. Smiling.

My psych has helped me but, my boyfriend has made me want to help myself more and improve every day.

The forgotten art of copying [the constant self],2,ssh8l0,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssh8l0/the_forgotten_art_of_copying_the_constant_self/,2,"**The art of copying is misunderstood.**

Copying is a powerful tool for learning and is not used correctly. The art of copying is brought to just simple copy pasting. Which is not the same. The final outcome and perceived notion of copying and copy-pasting are the same - you use the text or code written by others in your project, but the internalization and the outcome within is different.

I am against just merely copy-pasting. We all struggle sometimes to find the right expression or the right function that will make our code to do what we want. And at first glance it is always easier to just mindlessly copy-paste the needed chunk in the text or code to quickly approach the desired outcome of finished essay or a project.

It is hard and time consuming to come up with something new and original from scratch. It takes mastery to do so. It is much easier to reuse the ideas of others. Most of us operate by deadlines, that demand compilation of essays and code, which, if not completed on time, can lead to the professional demise. Thus, we race to copy as efficiently and discreetly as possible. And this race forces us to use easy-to-use solutions just like copy-pasting. And we do that without understanding, internalizing, mastering what we are copying. This may lead to some hefty problems in the future. Our code may produce unknown bags or the essays we submit may be lackluster and arise professional questions. One must internalize what he is copying.

There is a famous story of Hunter S. Thompson, the writer of “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” copying out “The Great Gatsby” and “A Farewell to Arms” word by word on his typewriter to feel and learn how the Masters of the craft write.

It is hard to come up with something new without internalizing and mastering the field. If you want to come up with something new you must learn the art of diligent copying without pasting. If there is a code that can do the job, or a paragraph you fancy that you want to put it in your essay with a reference then do not just simply paste it. Do your diligence and write it out letter by letter, word by word. You will feel the intent of the original author. It will take time, but you will internalize their ciphers and start to understand them, you will be on the path of mastery. You will discern which parts of that writing will collide with your intent, or may lead to future mistakes or errors.

If you like abusing the proofing tools in the sake of speed, you also will not learn. Do not blindly use the proofing tool, in the notion of perceived efficiency. Try to understand why the proofing tool or the error scanner gave that red warning, and correct it yourself. If you relay on these tools too heavily, you will not notice the obvious mistakes, which these tools do not underline. You will learn by deliberately correcting your mistakes and this will lead to fewer errors in the future.

If you want to master a field my advice is to try and copy the pieces of masters who know their field. Copy without pasting. Word by word. You will not understand the functions or the intent of that cipher at first, and it may take considerable amount of time, but at the end you will come out as a person who has a feel of that field.

but that peace didn‘t stay, new challenges keep popping up. they‘re not huge or terrifying, and not necessarily negative, either - I recognise them as room for growth, recognising trauma and unlearning my responses to it, but I am just so tired, and I feel like I lack stability. the positive changes have brought much good to my life, but they‘ve also shaken up my foundation, and now I‘m at the point where I feel like I have taken myself apart so many times to fix the pieces and make them better that I don‘t know how to put them back together anymore.

This delusion is currently clashing with the fact that I have not gotten work, my youngest sister is independent and almost never home anymore, and my mom might not stay in my childhood home for many more years if nobody goes there.

I have felt very ambivalent as of late because I'm a 28 year old man who has wasted almost all of my twenties socially. Academically I'm doing average. I have not a bachelor's degree but right below it but it's at least a degree, and I can find work using it, so I feel that is a security. Socially, I don't even know what my life is anymore. I never had larger friend groups and I know I've had severe social anxiety since I was a teen. It has only gotten worse, really, as I now basically feel like a hermit. I'm sure COVID helped that as I also dropped out of my top up degree in 2020 when it was at the peak of lockdown. Since then, I've been stagnating.

It's as if I have went deep down a course in life that I feel no passion for. I just have to do things but I don't wanna do any of it. I had a weird temptation of a thought the other night, that I could abandon my software profession for good and I felt happy thinking about it. Life is always full of opportunities and circumstances, where you don't end up doing exactly what you initially meant to do, but I think I'm just deep down some kind of rabbit hole. Any friend group i once had lost contact with me. I did not bother anymore and weeks turned into months turned into years, and all 3 of them are just gone. It makes me feel low self esteem around other people even my roommate who I'm very avoidant with, both because of anxiety but also not wanting to outright reveal that i simply have no friends anymore.

I'm sure several doors are open, but it's as if I haven't realized that it's been 6 years since I really *lived* and saw people regularly. I definitely need help, but I don't like the process of our health system, or how expensive therapy is. I also don't just wanna sit on my hands and talk it out. I feel like I have to do something, but I can already think of hundreds of things I do not want to do. I have no spontaneity. I'm rigid and timid.

How do you retain the will to live and bravery against all the odds in life?,23,srt7bv,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srt7bv/how_do_you_retain_the_will_to_live_and_bravery/,16,"Hey guys,

I'm a 24-year-old man in my final year in university. You could say I had a pretty sheltered upbringing and really haven't been taking life seriously till now. I realized this is a coping mechanism because I don't like facing reality or taking charge of my life. I'm scared to live. Adulthood just seems to be filled with horrors with very little hope. Even the tiniest mistake can wreck your life. So many things are decided from your birth itself: What family you're born into, the class you belong to, the race you belong to, and your genetics. All of these have a massive impact on your life. Making mistakes in adulthood is permanent, you mess up bad and it'll follow you all your life. Without money, power, or influence I don't know how an average person lives. how do you not live in constant fear? It just seems like in today's society we're at the mercy of other people, the system, and the government. Society personally doesn't care about you much at all. Cross the wrong person, you can get killed. Get into legal trouble, you can spend most of your life in jail and have your life ruined. The legal system is host to a lot of problems and only cares about maintaining the system not enacting justice to the victim. the job market is filled with cutthroat competition and so is seemingly everything else. The ideals of life, romance, and bliss I believed in are all but gone and the true realization of how bleak life can get is destroying me. People are mean, cold callous and can turn on you at a moment's notice, betrayal and cheating are common in relationships. Getting married and getting divorced, while paying alimony and child support for 20 years feels like a nightmare. Trusting people and having them betray you hurts. So does getting fired, but these are at least things you can walk away from. There are choices and decisions which will screw over your life forever and they scare the shit out of me.

People my age seem much more mature and like weathered adults than I am. I didn't have wild teen years or anything, I was just a nobody in school. Now it feels like I'm a nobody across a massive scale and invisible. I don't think many people are as paranoid as me, they think more on the micro-scale it seems. They seem much more experienced in dealing with people and social skills, in acting tough and not letting people walk over them. It seems to live and survive one has to grow tougher and borderline sociopathic to retain their own sanity, disassociate themselves from their feeling and not get too close to people. I don't think I have what it takes to live, I always keep earning for that security and safety childhood bought me. Now I'm a grown man so I'm the one who has to do the protecting but inside I still feel like a scared kid. I never had a father around growing up to teach me how to be a man so this is probably the result. I don't think I'm able to live and face the uncertainty of life, it's a messed up world and there's very little i can do to influence and change it.

What advice can this sub give me to deal with my anxiety and paranoia?",1644786912.0
Unsure of a past event's impact on me,1,ssay0u,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ssay0u/unsure_of_a_past_events_impact_on_me/,0,"I \[25m\] have only had 1 relationship, it was from when I was 18-20. 

In the last month of the relationship, both her and I knew it wasn't working and due to this were both pretty withdrawn and sullen. I was then pulled aside one evening and confronted by her stepfather as he accused me of possibly abusing her, ""if I ever found out.... \[insert threat\] would happen"".

Since that relationship ended in 2017, I haven't really attempted to look for another partner at all really. I now find that I'm very apprehensive of letting anyone know that I'm attracted to them, I simply don't know how to tell them. It feels like I have a complex where I have to wait for *them* to initiate anything. I was actually invited to meet a girl at a hotel purely to drink/have sex, and in the awkward period of arriving and starting to drink, she made a joke like ""you're creepy actually, forget it"", which at the time totally floored me as I thought she was serious, I remember backing away to remove myself before she clarified it was a joke.

I've never been confident about much in regards to attracting women and I'm now at the stage where I'm beginning to feel more confident physically, but I know the (what I almost consider to be a) 'consent complex' remains. I don't know how to shake it.

On a more NSFW note, which may not even be relevant but I'd thought I'd share as it could be, perhaps my biggest 'turn on' in regards to sexual activity these days is >!receiving a hand-job from a partner, as to me, it shows that they.. actually want to do it? because it requires most effort on their part. As opposed to them just 'letting something happen' which is what I fear more than anything. !<

Bit of a bleak read, so I apologise for that - just wondering whether anyone has any thoughts. Cheers.",1644846245.0

I am 19 and still in college...and I'm already feeling the weight of my dreams/ambitions/goals already weighing down on me. Up until now I've always wanted to improve myself for the sole sake of accomplishing my various goals and dreams.

You know the typical : Get rich , have a family , buy the rights to a few light Novels and  other old cartoon series to rewrite them to my liking. The usual stuff.

But now that I'm an adult  and have still  made approximately...zero percent in accomplishing ANY of my life goals and the more time passes,  the more it feels like my goals/dreams are becoming more and more unreachable. And I wonder what's the point of even going on sometimes if I know that I can't do anything and will likely die  before I can get even one thing on my list done ( It is long ).

Its almost funny in a way, how the dreams and goals I once looked at with such optimism,  now fill me with undeniable dread and anxiety . Feeling more like unbearable burdens or a mocking reminder of how stupid I was.

I constantly have the desire to self-educate myself in different subjects. How should I deal with that?,14,srrt2y,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srrt2y/i_constantly_have_the_desire_to_selfeducate/,7,"Currently, I'm a 24 year old math student, doing my master's degree. Everything is fine, but especially if I've got some free time, I kind of start to feel the *need* to self-educate myself about different topics additionally.

The simplest way to deal with that would be to start self-educating myself, reading some books, watching some videos.

But my problem here is a little bit deeper than the usual curiosity you might have sometimes.

When I went to school, I obviously was very good at Math as I'm studying it right now. But I really sucked in other things, like writing essays, learning French, PE, Music and Art. The only other subjects I was good at were - besides Math - Physics and History.

And, actually for a long time already, I feel so dissatisfied about having been bad-to-average in these subjects. And I also ironically feel dissatisfied about Physics and History as I have the feeling that I ""could've expanded my knowledge as I was already good at it""

So, my question is more like a psychological one. I simply don't know how to deal with it. I constantly, day and night, feel the need to be ""in school again"" and finally get A's in things like writing essays, French, and in all those subjects I freaking plain sucked. I really feel as if I'd be only satisfied if I will become a virtuoso, artist, writer, fluent in French and maybe other languages 'cuz I can, etc.

It's not that I crave the acceptance of others, it's more that I crave the acceptance of myself. 

It's so much to repeat and learn that I simply don't know where to start, I mean I'm not in school anymore. That's the other problem. Maybe there are some free PDFs of school or college books I could use? I mean, I don't even know how to properly plan such a thing.",1644783290.0

* Creates a sense of fullness and reduce appetite
* May promote weight loss
* May help with the digestion process

Questions:

* Did it improve your overall health or a specific area?
* Do you find yourself eating more or less during each meal? 
* Did your weight fluctuate?
* Did you experience any changes in your digestion?

Tips:

* Set a reminder so you don't forget to drink your water before each meal
* Test out different water temperatures for different experiences, if any.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644815314.0

""Why am I even doing this?"" ""Why do I meditate and journal? Why am I working out? Millions of men and woman are okay with comfort and live seemingly good and healthy lives, why Can't I just take that path?""

I bet that every single person reading this has been plagued with the same thoughts as I. Through reading books, being introspective and planning out my ideal future, I can give you some reason why. 

You can take onboard all of these reasons, some of them, or none! 

&#x200B;

# Do it for humanity, or your family, if not for yourself

This is a much more objective outlook when it comes to opinion. Most people want to help their tribe.

&#x200B;

Society is going to shit. Companies who sell us Medicine to help us with our problems are also the same companies that may cause us these problems in the first place. Take cereal companies and weight loss orgs. 

Facebook becoming the Metaverse - Originally a platform to connect us to our loved ones, share and cherish memories, now turning into a virtual world of instant gratification with no accountability for our futures - This is so much worse than even the worst abusers of current social media due to the higher immersion of these spaces.

You could also go into the whole ""We are controlled by a specific and limited set of people and politicians, companies etc etc. are just figureheads for power and control"" conspiracy theory, but it does not matter which theories you believe in - The cause AND cure of mass media consumption stay the same (even if you believed aliens were controlling us or that we were in the matrix, the cause, outcome and cure are all the same)

&#x200B;

**We NEED to be good to ourselves, then our tribe, then our significant other, then our children**

&#x200B;

I believe in order to change the world, you can either provide Scale, value or both. Most people will never scale up their influence outside of their friends, colleagues, partner and children. But I can assure you that this is ALL of the influence that you need. You must take the steps to set the example: 

Influence the people around you to be grateful, savour what they have, learn to love and build their strengths, embrace and challenge their weaknesses. 

If we all did this, we'd change the world very quickly. We'd be happy, heave healthy partners, healthy children, healthy friends, healthy colleagues. Of course the world wouldn't be Hollywood perfect, but we'd all be human in the purest form - unchained from mass marketed pleasures as an escape from our unfulfilled lives, instead learning to be grateful for what we have and savour what we want to keep close to us. 

&#x200B;

# If you don't know your purpose, just continue anyways 

I struggled with this for a short while. I originally wanted to be a games artist. Now however, after a lot of introspective work, two main points keep cropping up that appose this idea.

1. I'd be contributing to the very problem I have with the digital entertainment industry (far too much mass media that people have no idea how to regulate)
2. I am creative, but don't enjoy mass media entertainment for it is an easily distributed source of fulfilment, without exploration of the rest of the world. the amount of opportunity in this world is more than I or you could possibly imagine.

So my purpose has changed. I don't know what it truly is yet, beyond wanting to help people with their own journeys and become a positive influence on as many people as possible. 

With that, I cannot full define my future. What I can define though is the work I put into my own learning, my physical and mental health, preparing me for content I may create. It may be a push to stretch my influence.. the toolset I need is the same: I need self improvement!!! 

The idea is to simply prepare for the future, improving as many aspects of your life as possible, whilst looking out for what your purpose may be. You can always dip from a certain life in favour of another one - you just need to put in the time and effort to figure out how to do this: Hence the idea of Holistic self improvement.

&#x200B;

# Give yourself the best life - Become a Learner so that you can win the game

People don't understand why they meditate. They can observe how they feel after they meditate and they use that as the reason, but that is not the reason. That is simply the outcome of meditation. You do not understand meditation until you have read a good book on meditation and you have been practicing a particular technique for a significant period of time (At least a couple months). Then, to solidify that understanding, you match the books experiences, stories, techniques, philosophy and science to your own experiences to further elevate them. then, you become the teacher. 

Now, scale this up with every single topic, virtue or skill you can think of: The amount of work needed to become your best self scales up from days, to a few years minimum. 

Most people could probably reach their goals within 5 years whilst on holistic self improvement - I mean the big goals that right now, they think are beyond them and that they cannot achieve. 

If your goal is to be a healthy, consistently average person, then you wouldn't need as long! Whether for yourself or for others, its worth learning the game and winning it so that you can make your time on this planet worth it.

&#x200B;

# Why I do it

I do it for all of the above reasons. 

I want a good life for myself. I know how to enjoy a meal of plan rice and chicken more than a person who indulges in a full takeaway, because I have done the learning and put in the work.

I work as much as possible to live by my beliefs, crushing the habits and activities that go against those. This will give me a great life in the future - I have no doubts.

I do it for everyone here, even if you do not resonate. if I could influence 30 people to improve themselves, and 2 people to become true game-changers, all of those people now go and teach their friends and loved ones how to improve, either to a minor or major degree. The cycle repeats and holistic self improvement spreads like wildfire.

If I could ever have the influence to change the school system in the future so that our children and parents were taught mandatory wellbeing techniques and got therapy across the world, changed the starting times across the world so that kids got proper sleep, gave mandatory parenting classes to parents, we would eventually hit a generation of men and woman all fulfilling their purposes, with 90% of the modern problems gone, and everyone benefitting from that change.

 That would be a great goal in my opinion.

Mark Rober Answers Why Your Life is So Hard,3,srzx2c,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srzx2c/mark_rober_answers_why_your_life_is_so_hard/,3,"(For those too lazy to read, here is a video version of this post in the comments)

We have Jack and we have Frank

Jack and frank are both asked to play a game. However, they are being investigated and the rules for the both of them are a bit different.

Jack whenever he loses a level, he loses 5 points out of a total 200 points

Frank doesn’t even know points exist and just plays.

Now who do we think would complete more levels and be more successful at the game

I thought Jack would, since seeing his points go down after every turn, he’s going to force himself to get better so he won’t lose more points.

But actually, I was wrong

The guy who didn’t lose any points actually did better.

This example comes from Mark Rober’s Ted talk “The Super Mario Effect”

If we put ourselves in the place of each guy during the game, we could picture Jack getting anxious and frustrated after every failure. He’s seeing his score go down and every time he looks towards it, he remembers all his past failures. And when they happen again or he fails multiple times on the same level, he beats himself up more for it.

Then we look at Frank. He doesn’t have this big bright red score making the same annoying sound effects after he loses, in fact he doesn’t even see it as a failure.

Maybe Frank fell off a cliff but all he’s doing is saying ok, I got to remember not to do that next time. He doesn’t recognise it as a failure but a piece of info that he has gathered that could help him.

I watched this video and I was thinking to myself but what if I could just not fail. Won’t that be better. I beat the system that way no matter what world I’m in, right?

Mark Rober was like “Hmmm idk about that”

Video games are very similar to life, we complete a few tasks it could be putting a ball at the back of a goal or defeating an evil dinosaur.

In Mario if there were no obstacles, and the pathway was clear and straight, who would play that? it would be boring.

But add in some monsters, a few things to climb and some puzzles and you got yourself a game that ppl are willing to pay money to play.

Without failures and a challenge, a goal doesn’t feel exciting and worthwhile to pursue.

So basically, we have to accept failure but not let it overwhelm us, once we look at it as a learning experience and an obstacle that we will overcome, things will work out in your favour.",1644807005.0

- Don't spend your time doing things aren't important or urgent. Keep reminding yourself about your priorities. A note or reminder could help

- Don't eat more than *needed* it's just a good way to make yourself feel lazy and waste more time

- If you feel lazy spend the time doing something that doesn't need a lot of attention or two a power nap

- Don't worry about the people in your life too much, it's not something completely in your control

- Never relapse, it's really not worth it

- Don't lie and life will be easier to live

- Don't spend time in regret, learn the lessons and just apply them next time

**My Family**: my mother is in poor health and probably doesn't have that much time left (she won't tell me how much longer she has, I just know her conditions are extremely serious and she's been getting worse).  My dad is pseudo-retired but does odd jobs here and there.  He's a nice person and does a lot of the household work, but he's also got some problematic beliefs that make him extremely annoying to be around (conspiracy theories, shit politics, etc) and he's awful w/ money.  My brother is almost 21 and hasn't done anything with his life after high school, and gets cranky with me just about any time I try to spend time with him.  

*TL/DR*: mom is in awful health, dad is financially irresponsible and has problematic beliefs, brother isn't doing anything with himself.

**About Me**: In college, I had my life together.  I was fit (-100 lbs from high school), getting straight A's in a useful major, had a nice on-campus job, and was starting to get the hang of socializing through trial & error.  There were certainly some missed/botched opportunities along the way, but overall I was on an upward slope and learning from my mistakes.  However, when I graduated in 2019, I lost sight of myself.  I picked a really bad paying entry-level job at the best company in my area hoping to work my way up the ladder (hint: I didn't) and address some work ethic issues I'd realized I had in other jobs.  I gained 115 lbs, I got sad over losing my great college social life, and I found it extremely hard to make friends.  I also felt low self-worth, as in college I was so proud of my academic success, yet I graduated into a job where I was making $17 / hour. 

Then Covid hit in 2020 and my life became comically boring.  Other than June & October 2021 when cases were low, I've lived an isolated lifestyle since Mid-March 2020.  My main hobbies of concerts, playing sports, studying at coffee shops, and playing board games w/ friends were gone.  Then in October 2020, my childhood dog died and I got (essentially) laughed out of an interview for my dream promotion, causing me to go on a downward spiral... and really I've just been in a ""make it through the week"" type mindset.  The energy to improve is gone, I do what I got to do then I browse the internet or play games all night.  Lots of the time I don't even have energy to do anything more than browse Reddit... literally watching a tv show in full or playing a video game start to finish would be an improvement for me lmao.   I do absolutely nothing on weekends.  I'll make progress for a week then give up.

I know I can be better than this, because I have before.  I know I can find the career I want, build the body I want, and find the friends/partner I want.  And really all I need to do to do it is to eat healthy, exercise some, and study some (I have one exam left on a certification that will drastically improve my job options).  However, I can't even bring myself to do that, even though I've known for 2.5 years that I need to.

*TL/DR*: 25, obese, shit-paying job, lost my hobbies to Covid.  But I wasn't always like this, I was a straight-A & fit college student who had hobbies and friends. 

**My Living Situation:** I think at the crux of my problem is my living situation.  You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with, and I only spend time with 3 people, none of whom care at all about self-improvement.  I've tried to get my dad and brother on board with my diet before, but they just don't care.  Any time I get a food craving, there's junk food in the house I can access.  My mom make these really unhealthy (but tasty)  meals nightly and there's always enough for me if I want some.  Free food sounds nice at a distance (until you remember I live at home because I want to help my parents financially, not to freeload).

Sometimes I feel like things would be better if I could just get out the house and resume some of my hobbies (particularly concerts/studying in public), but I just can't risk it.  With my mother's heart issues, Covid would probably be a death sentence.  Even though I'm triple vaxxed, I can still carry it to her.  I'm even applying for an exemption from my work's return to office plan for her sake (even though I low-key wouldn't mind getting out the house 2-3 days a week, and then studying at a library after work until 10 to dodge food temptation).  Loneliness also isn't a conducive feeling for self-improvement

*TL/DR*: surrounded by food temptation and people who don't care about self-improvement, can't leave home due to mom's Covid risk level.

**My Question:** so what can I do to improve myself in such an inconducive situation.  I want to be the man who can overcome adversity and build a better me.  I want to be a good role model for my brother.  I want to get a better job to help give my mother more comfort in her last days.  I want to become the type of man my future wife would be attracted to.  But it just feels like there are too many obstacles to overcome in my current situation.  What can I do to push through all the challenges and get better?",1644789778.0
How you guys deal with trying to be a better person but being confronted day by day with people that don‘t care a s***t about others?,22,srhnvv,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srhnvv/how_you_guys_deal_with_trying_to_be_a_better/,16,"Unfortunately I‘m not an optimist or someone that naturally sees the best in others.

Everytime I start the day telling myself „Today you won‘t judge people upfront, be positive and help people whenever you can“ it takes like half of the day and my motivation is gone. So many selfish people. I always ask myself why we treat eachother like this. It could be so easy with a tiny bit of respect and empathy to/for each other.

A few tips if you feel like any aspect of your life is hitting a low,4,sruemc,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sruemc/a_few_tips_if_you_feel_like_any_aspect_of_your/,0,"Long read but contains the way I turned my life upside down

I have been in a state in the past where nothing was going in the right direction, I wasn't considering myself intelligent enough to study, attractive enough to date or find a partner, and I was escaping reality in gaming and narcotics to not think about the fact that I would have never got better. This lasted for 3 excruciatingly long yesrs in total divided in two intervals with a short euphoric pause in between that still lead nowhere. And in some phases i even quit weed because even that was too painful. Well now I am doing exactly what I want to do in life, and even though I know I have to work hard to achieve the rest of my goals, I just landed a job that is a great entry to the industry where I want to work (music for games) and I have a healthy sex life as well as an exciting and blooming professional career just started in electronic music .

And this is how I got out of it:

- Focus on a short term goal and a long term goal. For example, your middle to long term goal ( and that can be 6 months to a year too) is to find a partner, your short term goal could be read up on art of conversation, why not even pick up artists or femme fatale tips, but most importantly get yourself attractive. I can assure you there will be plenty even younger individuals that will find you attractive if you are smart and fit, regardless of your career. And of course it won't be the first one you meet that woll be your life partner, but it will give you experience to meet more and land her. So start slowly changing your dietary and exercise habits a little bit at a time.

There aren't just Armani models and people like you. There is a lot in between. Self loathing without taking any action is just an excuse to me for blaming this on chance, the universe  or other people. The truth is that it's up to you to improve. And it won't happen in one day of course, so just focus on getting a little little bit better at what you want every day..

- if your long term goal is to get the job of your dreams, I think you know what your short term goal should be. Get better. Get the skills and networking knowledge that are needed. No matter your age, it's all about impressing the right people at the right time. And you will soon realize that having an interest and a passion in your professional life so intense that it makes you want the best from yourself, will in turn help your love life too.. having a purpose is sexy

- Visualize what you want, where you want to be. But actually do it. Say it out loud, write it on the walls if you have to, keep it resonating in your consciousness forever. Because the path for self improvement never ends and it starts with little, gentle nudges to your consciousness.

At first this will feel ridiculous, painful almost, but with some practice and dedication you will hardwire your brain to think that it's achievable and that will get your ass moving.

- Cherish connections with people only when they motivate you in getting better, directly or indirectly  Could even be an online connection with the person writing this post, if you think you don't have any meaningful friends or family members in your life. But do not invest energy in all the other relationships . Unless we are talking about parenting and fostering, to which you should always try to give another chance, people that drain your energy without giving nothing back could be part of your problem.

-Slowly and gently get rid of the habits that drag you down or are self destructive. Use those as a reward if you did a significant step forward towards your short term goal.

You will be surprised how soon you achieve your goals with this mindset. Hope this helps. It did with me :)",1644790079.0

Would anyone like to read my blog? Its called server-tude. How becoming a server made me a better version of myself.,2,srwjuj,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srwjuj/would_anyone_like_to_read_my_blog_its_called/,0,"
Hello everyone. I've had this idea for a book or blog or whatever for over a year now. Its about how becoming a server changed my perspective on life, saved me from addiction and selfish, self-centered interests and opened my eyes to a way of living that has only brought me positive results. Its a work in progress, and every morning I try and write a new post. The first post starts at the bottom, somewhat of an outline. I'm trying to shape it into a coherent form, but spent the first few posts trying to give insight into parts of my life so the reader can hopefully relate. There are so many aspects of my experience that I hope to share over the course of this blog in hopes that it will inspire others to adopt an attitude of server-tude. We live in a time where people grow increasingly more concerned with themselves, their image, their ""individuality"" etc. I feel we don't spend enough time focusing on the betterment of ourselves so was to benefit the entirety of humanity as a whole. We can't take care of others if we are unable to take care of ourselves first. We cannot succeed, at least to the highest degree, without the aid of others, asking for help, and accepting what is given and useful, and discarding what is not. Constructive criticism is welcome. It is still very informal, I'm still working on the site layout as whole as well. My hope is to eventually create a book, or some kind of guide that people can utilize to create a better version of themselves if they so wish. DM for details. Thanks for your time.",1644796225.0

I want to better myself but every time I make a plan for improving myself I feel so terrible and start crying. I know I sound really weak and kind of pathetic but this is just how it is right now. 

I feel like I am deficient in so many areas and even though there are a million practical things I could start doing today to fix some things, just. thinking about it, planning it, makes me cry and feel embarrassed and terrible about myself instead of excited or motivated. I just feel overwhelmed and inferior to the vast majority of people. I’m so deficient and it’s my fault. I know there are so many ways to fix my problems but I feel overwhelmed about it. I don’t know maybe I feel attached to my bad habits. I feel resentful about having to give up/seriously cut the main pleasures of my life (browsing the Internet, junk food, being alone for long periods of time, oversleeping). 

For example, my cognitive abilities have declined tremendously, and today I was looking up why and I found about 300 reasons that all applied which should be good but I just started crying. Why does thinking about self-improvement have to make me so miserable? What am I doing wrong? This leads me to avoid trying at all because I find it very painful and stressful to even acknowledge all my deficits and make a plan to improve.",1644787819.0

So I’ve experienced both these things (on many occasions).

1. People telling me I’m too hyper, or that I’m loud in a social situation,  or that I seem too desperate etc. It should be said that people don’t always say this to me in a nasty way, but yeah.

then to contrast this…

2. I get very quiet and withdrawn. When I’m like this I’m not just quietly but people tell me it’s rude how withdrawn I am socially. It also just makes no one listen to what I have to say. I get being quiet/shy is fine but I feel like another level, people actively choose
not to talk to me when I’m like this and skip to the next person.

So I want to know how come I see quiet people thrive socially in comparison to me when I’m withdrawn and struggle?

And how can I ever expect to be confident if when I try to be people make the comments that I seem sarcastic, hyper etc. 

I know the best advice is “be yourself” but in both these moods I feel like myself? Additionally, I know I shouldn’t care what others think but I’m at the point where every single social interaction I’m too hyper (so no one respects me) or too quiet (so no on respects me).

27F here, back in December I went through a break up that lead to an intense mental breakdown and sent me to the psych ward. The breakdown didn't have a lot to do with my breakup, but I realized I'd been struggling for a long time in life and was using my relationship and fiancé as a distraction and let it lead  my life because I didn't want to address my life. Once things went badly in that relationship, I felt my life falling apart. 

Now I am feeling a lot better and am trying to improve my life and my health, I no longer feel like a failure or a burden which has improved my confidence in myself. I think my main slip up in life is not knowing how to stick with a job consistently or feel like I can have a career in something.  I started working at 17 and since then I have had like 15 jobs. I've job hopped A LOT, but only because each job had higher pay. I think I've always been money hungry because my parents struggled a lot when I was growing up. My mom always job hopped herself and didn't really get her career started until she was in her late 40s. I don't wanna be like that.

Once I hit 21, I  got my license in cosmetology where I struggled a lot with and didn't feel comfortable doing that job until I was 25, but absolutely hated it. After being in the psych ward, I quit working as a stylist because I was tired of hating my job and being negative. Currently working at Starbucks, I love the job, but it doesn't pay a lot. They offer free tuition with ASU, but I really don't want to go back to school. School has never been my thing. 

 Even though I like being a barista, I don't think its something I can continue forever. I want to move back out of my parents house, I want to be able to live comfortably and not worry about how I'm gonna pay this bill or that bill, or that loan or how I'm gonna fix my car, or if I want to just have fun... I am considering going back to hair because even though I hated it. I made a decent amount of money working at a fast paced salon like a greatclips or sportclips. I'm also worried about job hopping though... I don't wanna be a chronic job hopper for the rest of my life. I just want to be able to find a career that I know I can stick with and pays well.

Does anyone have advice or been in a similar situation? What did you do to figure out what you wanted for your life? How is the career you have the one you knew you wanted to do forever?",1644798491.0

"I worked with a life coach, here's my experience",4,srlcn3,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srlcn3/i_worked_with_a_life_coach_heres_my_experience/,14,"TLDR: I'm glad I decided to work with a coach because that's how I learn best - someone keeping me accountable for the changes I need to make. Also, it's helpful to have a different perspective on your insecurities and realize they've all been fed to you. I notice a common theme coaches help you work on is cutting the bullshit chatter in your mind and living life from your intuition and gut feelings, which is your ""highest self"" (I.e. the ""you"" that isn't ego-driven and doesn't give into insecurities). Group coaching is pretty cool because you get to meet new people who are on your level and want to make a change in their lives too - it's easier to open up to strangers vs people you already know who may judge you or not want you to change. There are so many different types of coaches out there such as 1:1 or group coaching and they all bring different things to the table. Lastly, I feel like all the self-help books make way more sense and resonate more. Before, I was just reading them and taking bits and pieces that resonated, but now i'm realizing they're all saying the same thing - you get to decide who you want to be and here are some conscious or sub-conscious things that might be holding you back.

The reason I wrote this post is to tell people who are struggling that help is out there and they should definitely consider it if they feel very lost and alone. Please don't waste any more time, time will never come back.

How to find a coach: ask friends, Yelp, Google, Instagram, referrals etc. I found one coach through a referral, another through Yelp, and my newest one on Instagram. You can start following coaches that relate to you on social and see who vibes with you. 

Certification: Honestly, I looked into certifications and it doesn't really mean much. I didn't check to see if my coaches had a certification because I realize life experience/referrals were enough for me to know if someone was good - anyone can get a certification. 

&#x200B;

Hey friends. I wanted to share my experience about working with 2 life coaches in the past 2 years and now i'm on my third coach. If you asked me about life coaching a couple of years ago, I would have said ""uhh, no thanks, I can figure my shit out on my own"". However, in 2020 I kind of got to my wits end: I lacked motivation, I was always sleepy, my income wasn't where I wanted it to be, I had major issues with money, I would stress eat, I would feel envious of others, I would get offended easily, I would lash out, I would get hurt by others easily, I cared way too much about what people would think, I was a people pleaser, and all this while I was trying to start a business. At the time, I thought I wanted a business coach to help me figure out how to do the ""left brain"" side of business. I remember talking to a friend who hired a business coach and asking her how it was going. She felt so-so about her business coach, but she also was working with a spiritual awakening coach (nothing to do with religion). She told me her mind was blown. I was intrigued. The price tag was a bit high for me, so I kind of wrote it off. A few weeks later, my friend messaged me and told me the coach was doing a virtual talk and Q&A if I wanted to learn more about her and the program. I ended up showing up - it's free, why not? The coach definitely caught my attention. This specific coach was focused on women and was nailing everything I was going through (the stuff I listed above). It was group coaching, so I was a bit unsure, but I said screw it, let me try. The money part was a bit uneasy for me to digest, but honestly, I would probably spend that same amount of money overtime on clothes, eating out, drinks, travel etc. 

I started the program and it was with 15 other women in my demographic and right off the bat everyone was so vulnerable. Everyone felt safe in this space to share whatever they were struggling with and I knew I was in the right spot. I no longer felt alone. I made 15 very close friends all from my computer during quarantine - that in itself was pretty magical. Our coach would cover a different topics every week (body, money, family etc) and we would talk about it. Some girls would be on a ""hot seat"" and we'd all learn from her experience. This is when I realized group coaching was pretty cool - we're all going through the same shit, but with different characters. The program was 8 weeks long and fast forward... I thought I just did a decade of therapy to sort through all my shit. What I love about the ""coaching"" part is you get your process the stuff you've been through, but the coach makes you take action to help you move forward and be the person you want to be.

End result of first program: higher confidence, new friends, quit my job and decided to focus 100% on my business (doubled my income by going on my own), cut out toxic people out of my life, learned how to respond to shitty people with grace, learned how to take up space and use my voice, learned what I needed to shed - especially stuff my parents passed down to me, processed my past, worked on self-forgiveness and realized my power as a woman. 

Re: cost - I'm glad I invested that money in myself. I've been working on my money issues and seeing how investing in myself helped me make more money is evidence in itself that I was viewing money in the wrong way before. 

In 2021, I starting working with an ""Intuitive Business Coach"" to help me figure out my business. I had a slow month and it was taking a toll on me. I was falling back into bad habits of self-judgement and talking down to myself. My gut said to search for the word ""intuitive"" because that's how I wanted to run my business (vs following a set of rules). I searched on Yelp and found my lady. She helped me master my mind and deeply connect with my intuition. This type of coaching was all about ""thought"" - understanding the chatter in my head is just bullshit chatter and it doesn't really help. Example: I would talk myself out of getting out of bed and waking up early - but she reminded me this was all mental chatter - the real conscious me can just ignore the chatter and get up. It was pretty interesting. After working with her, I realized how to use my mind to my advantage. I could choose not to feed certain thoughts as soon as they came into my mind. I was more aware of what I would think. I would say ""more please"" to the good thoughts or ""no thanks"" to the bad the ones. This was life-changing to understand - I am not my thoughts, but here's how I can use thoughts to my advantage. Working with her helped me let go of expectation and trust my gut when it comes to my business. As much as it was about business coaching, it was for my life too. 

I had an epiphany the other month that I want to pay it forward and help coach others who are stuck in their heads. I've been responding to a lot of posts here, but I realized the only reason i'm able to help is because I got the help, so I wanted to share my experience.

Everytime it happens, I say to myself “i didnt cross anyone’s mind”, which kind of depresses me. The whole thing makes me feel quite lonely.

In terms of coping mechanisms:
1.I try to remember that in the past (pre smart phones), communication wasnt so easy and constant, and not having messages for days on end was the normal order of business. However, it doesn’t really help, cause we aren’t living in the past. 
2. I’m also trying to change the narrative by telling myself “everything must be fine, as far as I’m concerned”.

I am writing this in regards to what’s going on here at Pocahontas State Correctional Center in Virginia and I here is indicative of prisons across the US. We are on modified lockdown due to staff bringing in Covid-19 again. We are supposed to be separated- top tier, bottom tier- but they make us walk to the chow hall together, go outside together and let each tier mingle with the next. They let inmates handle and pass out face masks. Unfortunately, half the staff doesn’t wear face masks and they threaten us with charges if we don’t have ours on. They are steadily conducting cell searches walking into a two-man cell with two and three staff members at a time. They they proceed the next cell without changing their gloves. Protocol instructs them to bring our trays to us since a pod in our building has positive cases, but we are made us walk to the chow hall. Apparently, it saves them money because not everyone walks to get food. Yet, if they have to bring the trays to us then they have to prepare a tray for everyone in the pod. In building A pod they have positive cases and staff steadily go in and out, directly into the next pods. They are often not wearing a face mask and never wearing gloves. potentially spreading the virus. Yesterday between 9:45 AM and 10:00 AM in A.3 pod the assistant warden was walking around the pod not wearing a face mask. On 1.20.22 between 8 and 8:30AM staff conducted Covid tests to the pod without changing their gloves after handling each test. The staff here has zero regard for our health and safety. They openly make remarks about the virus not being serious and tell us we are crazy for getting an experimental vaccine. There have been so many complaints lodged against this place over the years, but it seems like it always gets swept under the rug and nothing ever happens.

18 and pretty much haven't done anything,0,srtk7u,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srtk7u/18_and_pretty_much_havent_done_anything/,2,"So, I'm 18 y/o and lately I've been geeling like I haven't done much interesting stuff in my life, or at least not many thingd that are expected from a teenager. I just had my girst kiss like a month ago, never went to lany parties cause the friends I had weren't much about that type of things, just did drugs like two times and never dated or had sex. I know that all of these things are pushed by society and it's pretty stupid to expect underage people to do afult stuff, but I bet you guys know about the peer pressure going on beetween young people about ""being cool"" or having done asany things as possible.

The truth is that I've always been extremely insecure about each part of my body and personality. All my life I couldn't see myself in the mirror without feeling absolut hatred and disgust for myself. Since I was born I had a shot load of family trauma going around me, I never felt safe not even in my house because of my emotionally abusive dad and how I always knew he was gonna kick me out someday and how he would find any reason to do so. Apart from that I dealt wuth an ED and suicidal thought when I was just 12, and even though I was able to get rid of that (Not completely, but almost) with the years, I've never actually felt mentally stable. So I've never felt prepared to have sex with someone or to even kiss anyone because of how ugly I felt, and I never tried to be like ""the cool kids"" because I always felt like I wasn't enough to be like them and I would die being ""the weird kid"". 

But like a year and a half ago I started working on myself and noticed that I've never been as ugly as I pictured, I was also never as fat as I thought and actually whenever I go out of my house with my family at least one person finds me attractive. But I just came to that realization now, now that I had to spend the last two of my teenage years locked inside of my house because of quarantine, and even when I canhed school the last year of high school I still never dared to go as many of the parties I was invited to or to make as many friends as I could because of how insecure I am, so now I'm legally and adult who's gonna have to stay one more year in my house just studying to give an exam so I can get into a university when I'm 19 and thinking the whole day of how I'm gonna be around ppl who have done everything in life and lived it to the fullest when I've barely had my first kiss and I even couldn't sleep for a week thinking about how I maybe did it terribly (I can't remeber much, I was drunk). So I've tried to spend this time just hanging with my family and chilling doing stuff by myself, which has felt actually good but I'm still worried ppl will judge about not having friends or even a gf when a full 18 y/o 
 Do you guys think this feeling is ever gonna stop or change? Are young adults as judgemental about this as hs teenagers? Any tips on how to stop being so insecure about it?",1644787867.0

I graduated HS in 2017 and began a 4 year university where I naively chose to major in biology with hopes and desire to become a rich doctor and make a lot of coins to buy cool shit and live a sumptuous life.

After three semesters, I flunked most of my courses and received a GPA 1.7. My parents were furious and forced me to drop out and attend a 2 year community college where I can obtain an AS degree and use it to nullify my entire academic records before re-enrolling. Those 2 years were quite miserable; I completely lost connections with all of my new friends and just felt a prisoner who had been incarcerated for being fucking stupid. I learned the importances of self-honesty and authenticity the hard way. On the other hand, I found a new interest in business management.

In Fall 2020, I returned to the same university that I enrolled in the first place with a new major in business administration and worked hard to achieve redemption; I partially accomplished it by obtaining GPA 3.6 and impressing my professors with my academic performance. I am seeking to graduate strong this December with GPA around 3.8.

However, I still have no internship experiences and only a few part time retail work experiences; I did my best get one last summer, but completely failed. Although I'm using available school resources to refine my interview skills and actively applying for positions, I'm scared I might fail again and further jeopardize my future. I honestly don't get how I'm good at receiving good grades, but not at getting intern or jobs.

Furthermore, I really want to study cinema, meet with congenial film students, and get hands on experience in filmmaking. But I realize that will never happen in my university since it has no related major as it is an engineering school; ideally, I'm supposed to be attending NYU or USC. Because of this, I feel alienated and lonely in my current university and have no place in their community.

My youth will be over in a few years yet I still consider myself a failure and loser. If my HS classmates found out what I am today, they'd probably laugh at me. And my  anxiety is slowly evolving into self-loathing and chronic depression.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this or are you going through a similar situation yourself?

Interesting Observation (Overthinking),4,srfp3z,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/srfp3z/interesting_observation_overthinking/,0,"Like many of you here on this subreddit, I was literally tormented by overthinking on a daily basis. Put the cliché ""overthinking problem"" on a side for a second. What i was living was an ""overanalyzing syndrome"". I kept on remembering events that happened years ago and getting sad over them, regretting the way i behaved, or perhaps regretting why my behaviors breached the characteristics of the man i want to become. I deliberately called it ""overanalyzing syndrome"" because it is actually a disease that fucks your life over. You remain in a loop of thoughts that you lose touch with reality. For a 17 year old, this is too much stress. I was losing focus, not getting the grades i wanted, and ditching the goals i wanted to achieve while i had the energy as a youngster.

Accordingly, i decided to conduct a tiny experiment that actually solved the shit i was going through and i hope it helps yall. I took an ordinary event, a really ordinary one that happens to everyone on a daily basis, like a joke someone tells you, or the type of mockery that goes around in your friend group. This event did not have any significance to me and I didn't think anything about it. Hence, for a whole day, i decided to overanalyze the fuck out of this event. I created the loop of thoughts deliberately and on my own. I was fully aware of what i was getting myself into. At the end of the day, i was really frustrated that this event occurred. I hated the entire set of events that led up to this exact occurrence that i overanalyzed. I kept thinking of it and what the intentions of the person were and why something like this would happen. PS. I originally didn't give it any significance. Because the people that lived this event with me are relatively close to me, i called each of them, and no one thought of what happened the same way i thought of it.

In conclusion, an overthinker's brain lives in delusion. Thus, the shit that happened in the past that you keep thinking about is probably a delusion created by your mind. Ok the event happened, but all the details you are overthinking because of are probably far from reality and getting you frustrated over a hoax. Please let the past stay in the past, and focus on the bigger picture. You have a purpose you must fulfill in your life. Your life story is yours, and you're just a background character in everyone else's story, so no one remembers or is thinking of what past event you're ruining your life over.",1644747779.0

Housed: San Quentin State Prison

I have discovered that there is no simple answer to the question “What is prison like?” or “Why I became addicted to drugs.” I used to feel haunted by such questions. I could not format a valid and truthful response. Yet, during this prison term I experienced two things which the California Department of Corrections had deprived me of during previous terms. The ability to learn about myself through self help groups, and the chance to learn through the on-sight college program. 
What Is Prison Like? 
 
Returning to the streets – faces, souls, and spirits I meet. 
Curiosity beating down the like, what is prison like? 
 
Prison is like being in a time vacuum where life has ceased. 
Neither moving forward or backward, alive but deceased. 
 
Prison is like a sack into which each day, each hour, drops another stone.  
Bending the spine until the tell-tale crack. 
 
Prison is like being at the bottom of a well, walking round and round. 
Without physical or material existence – incorporeal. 
 
Still, prison is not like hell, neither like heaven. 
Not all gloom and depression. 
See and you shall find the nadir of oppression.",1644777898.0

Last night I ended a long term relationship with someone who I deeply loved and fully 
depended on, after I learned he emotionally cheated on me and has urges that seem to require professional help. We ended things on good terms and he’s helping me transition to living alone.

Today is my first time being alone, sleeping alone. I feel afraid but will do my best. 

My goals: 

• Get to know and love myself. Learn to enjoy solitude. 
• Better my mental and physical health.
• Find fulfilling Hobbies. 
• Learn to build healthy relationships.

A device to do everything is a device to do nothing (part 2) [the constant self],2,sroiut,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sroiut/a_device_to_do_everything_is_a_device_to_do/,0,"The  Oxford Dictionary defines a friend as “a person you know well and like,  and who is not usually a member of your family”. It takes time to truly  know and cherish each friend. Social media distorted the notion of a  friend. It enabled the race to have as many ""friends"" as possible. As if  a few additional ""friends"" one has met once or most often never before  will increase the perceived status or the like count, in a lackluster  attempt to fill valuable. The people one hardly knows cannot be his  friends. One cannot truly know the people he fallows or roots for. Those  ""friends"" post just a facade of their true selves, and cannot behold  the existence of each and every of their followers. One is able to only  cherish a few true friends. **A friend to all is a friend to none.**

The  Oxford Dictionary defines a device as “an object or a piece of  equipment that has been designed to do a particular job”. It takes time  to truly master and cherish each device. The modern smartphone is  designed to do almost everything. It is our scheduler, assistant,  wallet, ID, camera, entertainment and personal tracker of our moves and  thoughts. It is so convenient to have it all in a palm of one’s hand.  But does it do a particular job? Was it designed to do a particular job?  What job does it do? Can one truly master it? Modern smartphone  distorted the motion of a device. It enabled the race to be in touch  with as many things as possible. As if a few additional memes one has  not seen before will increase the future status or the like count. One  cannot master the device he hardly controls. It just enables to post the  facade, in mere attempt to feel viable for a second. **A device to do everything is a device to do nothing.**

For  the ease of use the smartphone is designed to do so much one cannot  comprehend. And the main thing the average human does on it is to  consume the “socials”. It seems with it we are able to connect to  everything and everybody. It gives the sensation of knowledge, without  the hardship of actually acquiring that knowledge. Humans rely on it  more than anyone or anything.

High-end  chefs use and maintain several sharp knives. And they use each knife  for separate type of meat or plant. Why should they though? As each  knife in their disposal can do the basic operation of cutting and could  be interchangeable. Why not just use one type of knife in the name of  space saving and convenience? After all, almost every uses one type of  device in the name of space saving and continence.

I am not against having a smartphone, I am against of using it for almost everything. **It puts the mind in the poor state of a mental pod.**  A small space for everything. Each of the chefs knifes is tuned by the  mind to do one job on its best ability. To be in tune, and widen the  space in which the mind operates one must diversify the devices he or  she uses. Each device must be assigned and tuned to do a particular job.  So, when one is about to use a device, he is fully aware of what he is  going to use it for. And not to mix the devices for different things, as  a professional chef would not mix his knives for different meats. Each  device must be acquired and tuned to do one job in its best ability. **This is the way to muster the devices and not to be slave to them.**

I’m about to turn 21 next month and I still feel damaged from being in a long term relationship for at such a young age. It took me about 2 years to realize how much that impacted me because I pushed away friends and become very co dependent on this guy even tho he wasn’t very kind to me. Now I feel like I have my guard up everytime I talk to a guy and I usually just hook up with them and make sure I won’t let myself like them. I believe it’s because I think every relationship I will be has to be for a long time. I have since been better at making friends that actually care about me but now they all have boyfriends ugh I feel so alone.

But my mom is very very unsatisfied with his job and now not even a day passes without her complaining about her kids being dicks to ME; maybe that's a warning sign for me that if I become like him, she will surely whine about it behind my back. She says things that no child should hear- he is a failure and shame, useless and non - competent. While all other's children are great and having high salary, my bro is a fucker, she says. Whenever a topic comes up that involves my bro, she again starts with her 'useless child' things and I can't bear it anymore.

I (sometimes) find myself feeling awkward around how I socialize with others, if I'm interesting enough, if I'm listening enough, funny enough, and generally being self-conscious. Many times my sentences come out nervously as I try to maintain the other person's attention/interest. In these moments I'll tell myself to just take a breather and don't hust fill the space with ""fluff"" out of nervousness. Then berate myself later for it.

I feel like I still carry some social anxiety/insecurities from growing up. I wish I had a better idea of what I bring to the table and just honed in on that, and focused less on myself and more on having meaningful exchanges with others. I don't wish to be someone else, but often I think of my ""ideal"" self expression, and it's much more confident, positive, engaging, witty and kind, which I was some years ago when life was good and I was my most confident.

Perhaps because I'm going thru some life changes and have some uncertainties I'm working through that I feel this way. Is there a way to get it back, willingly?",1644740416.0

I’m 24 currently and similar to a lot of people here I’ve been in a constant cycle of trying to improve myself. Last year I thought I had it, I figured the answer to turning around my life was to isolate myself from everyone and bury myself in books and working and eventually everything would line up. It went well for about 4 months and there was a drastic fall off. I realized that a big reason why that didn’t work is because life is a constant, we get so caught up in what or who we WANT to be or whatever we’re working towards that we forget who and what we are NOW. This whole life thing is about PEOPLE, the ones you meet on the journey, the stories, the laughs, even the cries. I’ve recently been able to get back behind the wheel but this time I’m much more acceptant of the fact that no matter what I am working towards life is always happening and the moments are important. I wanna thank everyone in this sun who are on here sharing and supporting. I can’t speak for everyone but it DEFINITELY helps me. 😌",1644711980.0

I also really need to stop staying awake late it makes me tired. Now, gotta sleep.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644729842.0

I have come to a realization lately (with help from my partner being very blunt with annoyance) that i’m used to an easier way of living in the city, and i tend to expect things to work out as i jerkily (busily imo) jump from one job to another, one interest to another, and i’m not much of a homemaker. upon further self reflection… im SPOILED lol. and i lack maybe not determination, but a lot of personal dedication. 
i’ve been debating on how to WILL myself into being a more determined and stable person for the survival of my relationship and eventual family plans, but it hasn’t done me much help in the past half year. 
i currently work in Walmart as a clerk and i don’t hate it, but i don’t love having to speak to customers constantly. sometimes i claim i hate it, but its pretty easy and not bad. i’m just unchallenged and feel like i’m wasting my time. but is that just me being a brat?
most recently i’ve been debating joining the fire department as a more secure career choice, and the dedication it takes to complete initial training. i’m hoping a concentrated and intense training could teach me a lot of valuable lessons in the period of time it takes me to build a career for myself. but, my nearest hiring dept is 2 hours away. the navy is also a choice but it would take me farther from my family, and i would have to sacrifice my moving plans for the next few years. would that even be worth it i ask myself?

I dont even know where to start. I am fundamentally flawed and have created a situation for myself that will be difficult to overcome.

I am convinced I know the path forward but I've become stuck in quicksand. I have created bad habits that lead me into downward spirals filled with depression and anxiety. Lonelieness paired with my lack in ability to emotionally connect with somebody is one of my biggest pitfalls. 

It's like my mind plays tug of war with itself always repeating the same patterns that always mimic the same results. 

My addiction to porn has destroyed my relationship and personal life, my brain just wants to feel good via instant gratification. Trying to re wire my brain to focus on getting enough sleep, excersize, stretch, meditate, quit porn and social media, ect. I feel first hand the positive effects in terms of confidence. 

I have created a habit going between confident and so down on myself I isolate away while craving social connections and a sense of belonging, this is when I truly and deeply feel depression. Through that comes uneasiness  that seeks out instant gratification in order to temporarily settle the anguish of depression.
This leads to a dependency and an increase in tolerance. This is where my anxiety stems from. Essentially, my thoughts and actions are not congruent with each other. I feel like I'm spiraling out of control as a passenger to my actions just along for the ride.

I'm close to ruining a relationship with the only person in my life who truly loves me because I am so emotionally distant. Theres an uncomfortable tension in the room. I have one by one lost friends and if I became single, I would have absolutely nobody. I would be backed into a corner with and would have no choice other than to fight like hell. 

I would find myself fully living out of my comfort zone.but a way to find myself and be my very own person.

I'm also a musician that write songs and i'm good at writing but i feel like i'm lacking in conversation skills while i'm still really good at understanding what people feel in subtle things they express.

So to begin with in how i want help in self-improvement, i recently noticed since i started an internship in an IT departement where i need to often interact with clients that my mentor feel like i'm not listening what he say when i actually do listen but i struggle looking directly in the eyes so it might not help. Also when i have questions about cases i face while working i tend to express midway in my thoughts and i often need to repeat myself in a different way so my question is understood altough my problem is quite clear in my head. It really annoy me and i wish i could more clearly express my thoughts. But sometimes also my brain bug and it don't help altough i don't think i'm dumb or anything, it's just that i tend to get overloaded by informations at time and i noticed i really do learn fast, usually, just need 1 or 2 coaching interactions for the things i must learn

Also, that's not the only social problem i have, i tend to get clumsy and/or uncertain when i'm observed while doing a task i normally do without any problem and i don't know if people notice but it make me afraid to look stupid,for example it happen when i must interact directly with a client, when i'm trying to explain my question or at a friend house for example when i eat there and there's thing like their parents or anything, i start overthinking every normal as fuck manual task instead of doing them automatic like normal. 

I just wish i could be normal like everyone and it tends to hurt my self-esteem even if i know i have friends, stuff and great musical skill. I'm just always feeling like a weirdo and i would like it to stop.

Hey! I feel a little sad rn.,1,sre9w3,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sre9w3/hey_i_feel_a_little_sad_rn/,1,"Hi I was feeling a little sad today. I don't feel like getting out of my room. I don't feel like getting out of my bed. I don't know why.

I shifted to my college recently and the fun fact is that I don't have any friends over here. I'm living in my hostel room all alone and I can hear all the students from the next room having fun.

It is been a day and a half since I came to the hostel and I haven't unpacked fully yet. I have classes and tests from tomorrow but I don't feel like studying. I haven't even brush my teeth or taken a bath from yesterday. I miss having friends.
Last night I was feeling the same way I feel right now and I thought to myself that today I will go out of college and do some shopping.
But it's 2:00 p.m. right now and I haven't even gotten out of the bed right now.

I am not depressed. I just feel a little sad. I guess I miss having friends and fun conversations. Haven't had that for a very long time.
Last semester I went by myself and sat with those group of people in my hostel to have fun hoping that maybe we will become friends. But I felt very unwelcome over there. So now I don't feel like going. 
Nobody talks to me unless they need something from me.

Idk why I am writing this here. I don't even know what I am expecting of you guys.
Main thing I'm worried about is I'm not even getting my personal things done. I don't feel like studying I don't feel like going for lunch I don't feel like brushing my teeth or clean my room. I just wanna lie on bed all day and it makes me sad.",1644742034.0

Social Battery is Drained Almost Always,9,sqzwri,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqzwri/social_battery_is_drained_almost_always/,7,"I (26M) am a relatively introverted person but I am not socially inept and I have outgoing tendencies. I am actually a Sales Manager at the company I work for which requires me to be social pretty often. 

Over the years, I have noticed that I feel less and less interested in social gatherings, meeting up with friends, making new friends, etc. Every now and then, I will hear from a friend asking me if I would like to go grab some beers or do something social. I find myself making excuses and feeling anxious at the prospect of having to do that. For the most part, people do not reach out anymore to see what I am up to. I know this is probably because I do not make myself readily available. 

I feel guilty about this. It seems like something has been changing in me and it is not for the better. It is almost as if I am less and less interested in people. Or I have less energy to be around people in a social setting. It bothers me. 

Does anyone else have trouble with this? How do you motivate yourself to be more social and engage with people more often? I do not like to avoid spending time with friends and having new experiences but it is very challenging these days.",1644696181.0

Crying in dreams and is this loneliness?,3,sr4ilf,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sr4ilf/crying_in_dreams_and_is_this_loneliness/,1,"Hi,

this is maybe a very uncommon topic but since months and years I want to be hugged from beautiful girls. Also I have dreams where I have an accident and someone helps me and is there for me.. Also I cry a lot in my dreams then, I even think sometimes what is if I'm dead. These kind of dreams began I can remember when I was about 10 years old.

Anyway, do you have the same dreams or are yours more positive, is this normal what I dream or a sign of depression?
So the thing is that I would like to have a girlfriend and friends because I have no one, maybe it is a sign of loneliness?

I like to cry in my dreams and I like to play the victim but isn't it unprofitable when I want friends/a girlfriend because no one likes victims?

Destroy the Meta Fuc*ery,9,sqwd3e,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqwd3e/destroy_the_meta_fucery/,5,"Two years ago, I started to greatly improve myself. I changed my lifestyle. I started eating more (and more healthy), forced myself into gym (and it begins to show results), read more, started thinking more rationnaly, didn't give a fuck about what wasn't. I realized I was lonely and never had true friend but managed to take it as a chance and I now nearly live in peace with that. Opening myself more to other's opinions, got rid of some social media and even found where was my balance between intro and extraversion (now I clearly without regret can say no to what I don't want and yes to what I want about parties etc)... 

But still, I would really like to erase my fb account since I don't use it (and find it way more toxic than reddit that is actually useful). Why am I keeping it then? Because now that fb knows a lot only need it for using messenger, it would cost if they left..

Anyway, the only other social media I use is Instagram for professional purposes which is not linked (yet) to fb.

How can I find the strength to leave messenger & fb with the loss of 'facility' to contact the people I need? Using the mobile phone often cost, so fb have a pretty reason..",1644686338.0

Give your pain a job,13,sqrps5,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqrps5/give_your_pain_a_job/,3,"Feeling depressed when you’re on vacation is incredibly annoying. You’re not at work, you’re eating good food and you feel obligated to be enjoying yourself, since this is the “good part” of life. But anxiety and depression don’t really take days off. So here I am crying on the beach with a $15 margarita wondering why existence is pain and what the point of it all is.

Well, that’s kind of the point, right? Because suffering with purpose at least feels productive. Fighting through the last mile of a marathon feels meaningful and strong. Recovering from a breakup with a toxic person is at least taking steps towards something better, right? It makes a difference when you can see the purpose behind the pain.

But depression and anxiety aren’t rational states of mind. They are pain without purpose. They don’t really care what is going on in your life. How long can we keep trying to fix our life when the progress bar only ever says “Not there yet”?

Worse yet, sometimes we work backwards and assume there’s something wrong with us, as if the pain must be punishment for a wrong deed. Kind of like getting shot by a mugger and then painting a target around the wound. “It’s my fault, I shouldn’t be walking around with this target on my chest.” Yeah, it seems ridiculous when you read it written out, doesn’t it? Then why do you beat yourself up over social interactions and work disasters that aren’t your fault? It’s the same thing.

Crying on that beach taught me that the worst part was pain without purpose. I could handle pain, I’ve handled tons of pain in my life. But I hated that it was random, that I hadn’t done anything wrong, and there were just some chemicals misfiring in my brain that made me feel this way. That old trauma or coping mechanisms from childhood had left scars that would never heal completely. I hated that I was going through pain and it wasn’t even contributing to a positive goal, as opposed to the last mile in a marathon or healing through a breakup.

That’s when I decided to give my pain a job. Maybe this pain didn’t come pre-packaged with a purpose, but I could create one. I decided that I could write about how to work through anxiety, trauma, fear of failure, relationship issues, and all the pain I have gone through. The pain didn’t start out with a purpose, but there was nothing keeping me from giving it one. I could choose to find tools and books that addressed my pain and then guide others going through the same issues. I was going to feel this pain anyway, so why not find a way to make it constructive? I made that decision to start writing two years ago, and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done.

Could this work for you too? Can your pain be used to create art? Can it give you a reason to reach out to someone and ask for support, strengthening your relationship with them? Can it give you a reason to go for a walk or read that book your therapist mentioned or do some journaling like you’ve been meaning to? I don’t know what the right conclusion to draw is, all I know is that your pain can have purpose if you give it one. And pain with a job is much more tolerable than random pain that exists just to hurt us.

You are in the driver’s seat. It is you who decides how much you want to get out of this. It is you who is feeling the pain, and you who knows what activities or actions would most benefit you right now. This pain can be the reason you do what is best for you. I know it is easiest to sit idle and stay in your comfort zone, but I don’t think that’s going to make you feel better. I want you to think hard about the different ways you can use this. Many great people had rock bottom moments, and that pain became the motivation for them to turn things around. Look for purpose. Take control of your pain, give it a job, and get to work.

I’m sorry you’re going through this, but I promise you it can feel better once you use this as a chance to grow. My pain had no purpose either until you read this. If this post can make one person make a better decision then it was worth it. 

Now it’s your turn.",1644672954.0

Anything positive and warm makes me feel uncomfortable. Im not used to it, my body responds negatively in ways (backing away, disgusted face automatically etc). I hate them with all my heart. Im always prepared that it will end in humiliation of some sort. That i let myself be vulnerable and things get destroyed. I feel like I need to protect myself.

However, we see each other in the university hall and train station (she takes another train tho). I know for a fact that even if we haven't talked, she knows who I am because I have caught her looking at me in the eyes a few times (also because I was the only guy in the whole class lol). 

I have asked a few female classmates and they have told me to either work up the courage to just approach her and ask for her number or play the ""long game"" of getting closer and closer to their group.

 I don't really know her but the times I have caught her looking at me made me feel really appreciated and also, I find her really cute. So basically my question is:

Should I just approach her and talk to her? If so, how do you work out the courage to ask your crush out? 

My biggest fear is not being rejected but rather to be seen as creepy.

How to improve your self esteem?

I don’t struggle with my looks really (not saying that to be cocky but I’ve never really thought “man I’m so ugly”). But I do struggle with comparing myself to others a lot. Every time I get into a relationship, it never works out. I feel like part of it is because of my low self esteem, and that I think I’m extremely boring. Like, if I date someone but they don’t have any of my hobbies in common with me, I have no idea what to do. Even just in general friendships I feel like this is an issue. 

I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and I feel like that is why I’m so behind in life (still living at home, 28 years old, no college degree, etc). I’m getting it treated now with medication as well as therapy. 

I have my hobbies which I really enjoy, snowboarding and lifting weights. But I can only snowboard for so long before the snow is gone lol. Lifting weights is great and all but even so, that’s about all I have to look forward to during the week. 

All of my friends from high school have moved away to a different state, have girlfriends, a house, etc, so my social circle is pretty much nonexistent now. 

I’m in this position now where it’s like I want to improve myself, but I don’t currently feel good about my situation at the moment. Like, I feel like I have to finish college, get my own place, etc, before I feel “accomplished”. I don’t think this is the most ideal because these are not things I can get in the short term. 

I want to be able to love myself how I am now, and not feel the need to have to do these things I mentioned above to feel good about myself. Of course I want to do said things, and I plan on it, but obviously things will not change overnight….

When I first get into a relationship, I feel great. Confidence is sky high, etc. But then, it’s like I become dependent on said relationship to feel good about myself, so if there’s any bit of “rejection” that I perceive (person is busy that week, we didn’t have sex, etc) I get insanely stressed out and anxious, and can’t focus on anything….

Anyone have any tips? I would like my self esteem to be more consistent, and to come from within, not what other people think about me :(.",1644719046.0

And 3) my biggest issue is I have too much free time inside my own head, I have my 3 boys half the week, work full time but once I come home my brain will think/over analyse everything, I feel like I’m slipping back into my depression because I can’t stop myself overthinking or worrying about stuff. 

What can I do?",1644709199.0

So I noticed that a lot of guys are now going through a self-improvement chapter in their lives and I asked myself how it is affecting your life? Do you feel happier? How long do you ""self-improve""? Did you slowly or radical/rapidly changed your lifestyle? 

I think most of us want to change in the body area, so going to the gym, maybe eating healthier, building a business, having more dates/getting a girlfriend etc..
For my part I builded a business and I slowly change my appearance but I still need to work on a lot of things - I read and watch self-improvement things since 2 years.

Happy to know how your life is going.",1644676622.0
The Ally of Reality,3,sqtqth,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqtqth/the_ally_of_reality/,0,"Be with reality, study it. Be its companion, trying your best to remove the mostmist between it and yourself. Only when you try to continuously expand your knowledge of reality (always conscious of the limited capacity to grasp it) will life start to flow effortlessly.

Religion and politics are not what I mean by reality in this context. By reality I mean the laws of nature, physics, psychology. Forget what we added to the natural state. Consider Nature in its essence, and dedicate your existence to widen your understanding of it. You have a limited time ticket of the human experience, do not waste it pursuing what is not a vital component of it. Of course you can strive for money and outer conquests, but make your inner journey the focus of your life and the source of your pleasure. Everything else is either a prefered indifferent or an undesired indifferent.

One of the toughest things is to stay faithful to reality when the whole culture sways from it. Consider that if something is considered by the whole culture as being a certain type of way or as having a certain array of characteristics, even when what you observe is opposed to all that, you tend to question what you observe instead of what the culture proposes as being the fact. So, culture has the power to make you question what results (reality) tells you and to make you accept what has not been “approved” by reality (i.e. what has not shown empirical support). So (and I also write this to myself) always remind that the culture swarm will pintch your inner cattle brain (which was useful for survival) and try to blind you from the facts, while at the same time making you act according to a model of reality which is very much apart from it. And we all know that when we either reject confronting reality or acting according to its fundamental ways of function we will not achieve our desired outcomes and therefore we’ll suffer.

So, from this we can conclude that striving to always refine our view of reality in order to have a better mental model of it (despite how pixelated it might be) is the only way to achieve self-realization and to fully seize the human experience.",1644679137.0
How do I cope with knowing that all my current friendships are surface leveled and that my friends don’t truly care for me?,30,sqiav3,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqiav3/how_do_i_cope_with_knowing_that_all_my_current/,6,"I’m 24 years old. I’ve found that as I get older it becomes more difficult to find friendships that feel meaningful.

Right now 90% of my social interactions happen at/through work. My coworkers are kind to me, they make conversation with me. But as soon as we all clock out, I no longer exist.

Whenever I try to message anyone outside of work just to say”hey what’s up? How’s your weekend?” I usually don’t get a reply until the next day if I even get a reply.

Whenever I ask someone if they maybe wanna go grab drinks on a Saturday night the usual response is “Sorry. I already have plans with my friend that I’ve known since high school”

I guess I just feel bitter due to how alone I am. I know I don’t have a right to be mad at them. They have people outside of work, but I can’t help but feel like whenever I try to form a meaningful friendship I get the door slammed on my face simply due to the fact they already have a friend.

I guess at this point rather than trying to force a friendship I’m just hoping to learn how to be okay with the fact that I don’t have a genuine friend who looks forward to spending time with me rather than it being out of obligation.

Any advice?",1644638326.0
"Feeling like I should be a certain ""type"" of person and feeling shitty for not being that. Also some other stuff. (repost from another sub where I got literally one upvote and zero comments... Thought I'd try my luck here)",11,sqn10e,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqn10e/feeling_like_i_should_be_a_certain_type_of_person/,2," 

So what prompted this post (but not this feeling in general) was me looking around on Behance for illustration references I like for a school project. First there's the sheer feeling of inferiority and worthlessness seeing so much amazing shit that people do, but that's another matter.

What I wanna talk about is feeling like I'm not the type of person I wanna be and that I can never change to be that way. So for example, I would see a post of some incredible illustration that I would consider the pinnacle of my work if I had done anything even NEAR it in quality and scope, and the person who posted it wrote something like ""had some time in between jobs so I did this"" or ""did this in quarantine"". And then I think to myself ""Why the fuck am I not like that? Why am I not the type of person who feels a need to make art and does it in such a focused and dedicated manner?"".

This example is not the only instance of this type of feeling for me- others can be in politics (""why don't my feelings line up with what I know are good political prescriptions? Why am I such a shitty person?"") for example.

For context, I'm a 23 year old guy who's currently most of the way through a 2 year media design program, and that's just about all that's really going on in my life. I have no real hobbies or interests. I just sort of burn time. The other day I read a sentence in some other subreddit that really stuck with me- ""What do you do that is fun?"", and I realized that for me there's nothing. Hardly anything in my life lines up with what I feel, want or any purpose I might have made for myself. And I'm stumped on what those feelings, wants or potential purposes might even be.

I feel like I've erased myself, basically. And that any inkling of an attempt to let some individuality resting in the back of my mind out is stamped out before I even realize it. Now, I did paint a pretty bleak picture with what I wrote, but things could absolutely be worse. I'm overall fairly social when I'm around people I care about and I've been taking better care of myself with time, so there's that. I've been getting (SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWLY) more confident and happy with time and efforts/realizations I've made, but the problem(s) remains.

One thing that I keep getting told (not that it's untrue, sorta) is to just do anything. But the problem with that is I just can't sustain any effort or endeavor when I have no internal (or less ideally, external) drive for it, like some goal or desire that I actually give a fuck about for more than 5 minutes. Even if the thing is something I don't like or whatever, I at least need some justification (working out > cause I wanna lose weight, for example). But the want is almost never there.

I realize I probably went off on at least one tangent there and rambled, but I'm sure points can be extracted from that. So, what sage advice do you people have?

Oh, and I apologize if this might not be the sub for this. If it isn't, can anyone direct me to one it might fit in?",1644655284.0

He always needs command! Its very tiring for me until i started not to talk much, and do EVERYTHING without his help. It's like he doesn't have a will to help improve our relationship unless I say what needs to be done. 

As i explain everything to him, that's when it was clear to him that he's the problem. He said sorry and asked for a 2nd chance but i respectfully declined. I love him but i need to love myself more.

A device to do everything is a device to do nothing (part 1) [the constant self],2,sqx5w6,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqx5w6/a_device_to_do_everything_is_a_device_to_do/,0,"The modern smartphone, the great equalizer! It seemingly does almost everything one could dream and desire. It is “a friend to everyone”. It is in a reach to all, from poor to rich. It does not matter how much money one has in his bank account, that small device is available for everyone, without a differentiation. In a span of a decade, it has replaced so many gadgets from essential productivity, such as alarms, calendars, timers, calculators, notepads, to entertainment. And it continues to penetrate our lives with its perceived convenience.

All those conveniences in a small device. A small **mental pod** that seemingly has everything one could desire. Inasmuch as you do not want to confine your body and spirit to a small space, why should you desire to confine your mind to a small blue screen?

Our mind subconsciously tends to gravitate and do things that it is used to do in the same space. By the power of association, we see each place for a separate purpose, and to be productive the space you have must be divided in separate areas.

Let’s say you have a magical tool, that seemingly does everything; you can build with it, you can have fun with it, you can do almost everything. Would you know how to use it most efficiently for your own benefit or would you subconsciously succumb to the familiarity every time you want to use it?

We think that we are in control of our actions, that we are hard to be manipulated. How many times, by the power of habit, have you automatically drifted to your home destination when driving, even if you wanted to go elsewhere?

Every room in our house, or every corner in our space should have a purpose, that we mentally associate with. Everything should have its place. The place for productivity should be only used for productivity related activities. The place for leisure should only be used for relaxation. It will be a mental mess otherwise.

Each place and each thing must have a function one mentally associates with. The mind of the most smartphone users is cramped within that small device. Most wake up with it and hold that blue screen till the heavy lids of their eyes are closed.

**A friend for everyone is a friend to no one**, said Aristotle, and I say - **A device to do everything is a device to do nothing**. Away with the notion of perceived convenience! As every tool must have its place and time of use, the devices we have must be differentiated.

You do not want to have one device for everything. That is a way of a poor mind. You do not want to wake up by the alarm of a smartphone and immediately, by the notion of habit check the “socials” the first thing in the morning. To check the feeds of people you do not truly know or care about. Are you really a friend to all, or to no one at all?

The alarm is only to wake you. Just wake up then. It should not be used for nothing more or nothing less. If a productivity is what you desire then acquire a specialized gadget that is mainly geared to productivity and it is hard to do anything else on it. If you want to listen to more music, do the same.

Differentiate your gadgets. You do not want to confine your mind to one small blue screen of death.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

I've documented how this thought has changed over the course of the last month:

I want someone to understand me. To truly understand. And yet no one does and I don't believe anyone ever will. No one truly cares. And if they do they don't take the time to let me truly know that they do.

no one will truly see me, understanding that hurts but through my work I can come to acknowledge that others can relate, they can relate to the shared pain and emotions and... I think that's enough. I think that's as close to being truly seen that I'll achieve and it still hurts to know but it's more settling than never being seen.

- 30th of January

Trying to force myself to accept the belief what no one will understand me is... Wrong. With time and patience I can show others. But I does just take time, and maybe with some I don't have that opportunity to open up like a flower and encourage them to look inside, sometimes people aren't supposed to stick around, sometimes they're just not interested and that's okay.

You can be completely lost in who you are and still have some of the most beautiful people love you and care for you. You might find that they don't understand you, and they don't, not when you live in your head. So stop doing that. Stop living in your head and you'll realise that they do understand, maybe not explicitly but they do and they care.

 I advise you do the same, please learn about proper ways to clean your skin from medical professionals, try to avoid internet ""life hacks"" and if you're male, it's not imasculating to own beauty products, even if they're marketed to women (tbh women's products are better anyway).

How do I stop urging for violence and physical harm when I feel anger?,2,sqcqdh,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqcqdh/how_do_i_stop_urging_for_violence_and_physical/,1,"Hello.

This is gonna sound hella edgy and some of you may really cringe reading what I'm about to say. I fully acknowledge the ridiculousness of my current struggle, so please, don't even bother beating a dead horse.

I (23M) have always been a salty person. However, up until now, I haven't experienced any problems regarding anger control. I've been having a hard time controlling my anger and rage lately. Why? I don't know. More on that later...

The thing is, my anger episodes have been escalating in a fairly scary speed and consistency. I've been feeling the urge to physically respond to the people and the things ""responsible"" (for the lack of better word at the moment. I know that, generally, I'm the one responsible for how I feel and respond to situations) for my state of anger. And what worsens the problem is me acknowledging that there's virtually NOTHING I can do to respond to them in a effective way. For example, if I see a bunch of racist people online, my natural knee-jerk reaction is feeling the urge of beating them until they regret saying and doing what they said and did, but we're all behind screens, probably thousands of kilometers away, with close to zero chances of me possibly finding out who those people are irl, where they live, etc. Why? Why am I like this?

I know it's not up to me to deliver retribution and justice into this world. I know it's not up to me to make justice with my own hands. I know it's not up to me to punish shitty people. So why? Why do I feel the way I feel regardless of acknowledging all of that?

Some may say that this urge comes from a place of deeply rooted frustration, and I can give it some credit. However, I can assure you I'm not your poster child example of online loser. I date a lovely and beautiful woman; I have a good degree; I have a hobby I enjoy; I work out, I'm content with my looks, but I still feel like something's missing. Why?

I also hurt myself. There are times when I can't stop punching myself on the head and face. In the absence of the perpetrators who triggers my anger, I end up hurting the only person I can: me. 
Sometimes I also do all that piteous scene -- punching doors, screaming on pillows, punching walls...

How do I stop? I don't want to be like this. I'm scared that, sometime soon, there may be a scenario where there won't be nothing between me and a bad person, which could result in a regrettable aftermath for us both. I don't want to hurt others, despite how wretched they may be. I know I would feel regret afterwards but, when I'm seeing all red, I can't think straight. I can't think about nothing else besides making them pay. I know it's not right, but I can't seem to fix myself and I feel that, the harder I try fixing this error, the harder I fail.
I also don't want to hurt myself or being hurt by others. I'm probably a terrible fighter + fights can be very unpredictable and the result of one can be very nasty and unfortunate, be it for one or for both of the sides.

Realizing that you are on the next level right now. This could seem a little nonsense for those who think they are not doing well right now.

But youre always a better version of the lower level. And theres always another higher level to your next level.

Especially if you have done a lot stuff recently and feel like there is no progress. 

Just get once in a mind state of ""you have reached a lot"" and see if youre still hunting to be on the next level.. or if you think first ""I am on the next level right now"" and act on that..

because youre in a mind state of ""I am at the next level"" it should automatically drive you to be so.

How do I redeem/forgive my racist past ?,2,sqc16k,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sqc16k/how_do_i_redeemforgive_my_racist_past/,1,"TW: abuse, violence, racism 


As the title suggest, I have a past history of racism. 


I was never particularly racist until I started dating this boy when I was16-17. He was emotionally manipulative toward me and overtly violent toward others. The first time I ever went on a date with him, he threatened to stab his friend and actually had a switchblade with him prepared to do it.  

he wanted to do join the military because he “wanted to kill the sand N- words threatening America”. he frequently discussed his desire to kill people citing that is the reason he wanted to join the military. He frequently used the N-word in a very hateful way saying he had the right to do so for the sake of a quality. He was a very angry individual and to this day, I have never met someone so hateful. And yet, I dated him for nearly a year. 
 

I will never forget the day I first went to his house and saw in his closet a confederate flag (a large one and that) with a small Lego of a black man with a noose hanging on his neck. I was disgusted by the situation but stayed with this man because I felt so unworthy of love and acceptance that I feared no one else would ever love or care about me. 


 Despite his abhorrent actions,I stayed with him for nearly a year despite. I didn’t care about myself or my safety and wanted love.  I feel like this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. 


To give context to the situation, I have a severe history of trauma. This obviously does not justify my decision to stay with him, but I would like to give a bit of background about me to understand why I would even be with someone like this to begin with. My father is a narcissist and my mother has borderline personality disorder. I cannot remember most of my childhood because of this years of serious emotional and physical abuse as well as extensive neglect I experienced as a very young child until my departure from my parents house at 18. I did not have a single friend in elementary school fearing people would yell at me disparage me or hurt me. I was often dissociating and was never treated for depression, ADHD, or anxiety despite the fact it was very obvious. I was instead, blamed for my own problems and told I was a disappointment and embarrassment for having them.

Because I dated this boy for so long, I adopted some of his racist tendencies despite the fact I had been so inclusive before. I said the N-word frequently as a senior even after we broke up, was opposed to things like affirmative action, and felt like people of other races were beneath me. 


One of the most embarrassing moments of my life was being in a car on my way to prom with an  aquantince playing a song and screaming the N-word. I felt entitled to say because I felt wronged by the world so I thought it was justified for me to do whatever I want without caring about others. 

Now, I am 22 years old. I have had a lot of therapy and growth realizing that the rage I felt against the world was because I hated myself and the abuse I endured for 18 years. I am now trying to go into social work, have three black roommates, voulenteeed at protests for black lives matter and taking several African-American studies course in college. 

Despite all of this I feel like a phony because of my past racist actions. I feel like I have to tell the world that I was like this because I feel so guilty about being flat person. Despite my circumstances, I still made this mistake and feel like I haven’t taken accountability for it and need to make it right.

What do you all think I should do to take accountability. I am so ashamed of my actions, I had to make a second Reddit accounts to be able to post this. Should I still feel guilty, I am honestly unsure because my actions were so terrible. Thank you.

TD:LR: from the ages of 16 to 17 I dated a blatantly racist and violent boy. This was because of my severe history of trauma feeling as though no one would love me if I left him, despite him emotionally manipulating and abusing me. I adopted his racist tendencies and often said the N-word feeling as though people of other races were beneath me, even though I was inclusive before this. Even though I am now a strong advocate for equal rights, I feel like a phony because of these past actions even though they were four years ago. Is there a way to redeem myself? Or should I just forgive myself? I’m very ashamed.",1644619989.0

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644553314.0

Well, being naive and an extrovert   I had not realized that I am good enough. So when one is naive and also an extrovert predators abound for this type of victim. I had been an easy target and had not an iota of belief in my skills or knowledge set, to an extent people had found me funny.  Lack of self-esteem fed my lack of logical thinking and vice versa. 

So, I a faculty in a junior college had thought that only my students liked me. This I am sure because the management would have kicked me out as they abide by their customers' words. I like the young adults or the kids. Teaching is also fun. 

Without them, my job is a misery. And I get to meet them from June to December only. The rest of the academic year is caught up with exams and vacations for the students. So June to December is literal heaven for me and January till May is Stygian’s boardroom. And my staff room; I do not dare tread in, though a few colleagues are my friends. I interact with the women attender staff better and sometimes find my company with them.

I had this feeling that most of my female colleagues cannot tolerate me.

But last week had been an eye-opener. I missed going to work due to personal reasons and did not interact online with anybody save the three colleagues who asked about me not attending work. I did give them a vague reply.

When I returned for work, as I was punching for attendance, I saw a few of my female colleagues staring at me, for long. And then I went back to my sanctuary. Later when I had to go down for some other purpose, where most faculty were present, many looked at me with surprise. Some hugged, some patted me. Some were looking at me with a smile. 

Gee, I was missed. Also, I think, people thought I had left the employment?

 It has been nice knowing that people actually like me.   The way of showing love is different for different people. And people are not actually bad.

I have resolved now to be more tolerant of people after this incident. Love all, but do not mistake others for their bad behavior. We do not know what they are undergoing.

People don't know what they want.

Even if they would know what they want, they don't know how to start.

Even if they would know how to start, they don't know how to get there.

Even if they would know how to get there, they still don't, because they lack consistency.

Even if they would be consistent and eventually get there, they will wonder: ""ok now what?""

Even if they get there and they decide to enjoy the moment that will still not last for long.

A little everyday or a lot every week?,9,sptt1p,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sptt1p/a_little_everyday_or_a_lot_every_week/,4,"Hey first post on this subreddit, I'm a 27 year old guy who went through a bit of an existential crisis a year ago when I realised I've wasted the majority of my time for ten years. Gave up playing music, didn't learn to drive, pissed a lot of money up the wall. I have a bachelors and masters but I did the bare minimum to get a ""good enough"" grade and I have a decent job at the moment. Now I actually want to improve myself and learn skills that I could've been committing to for the last ten years. So with that in mind, there's 3 main ""strands"" of stuff I want to do:

- Music: Guitar, DJing, general theory
- Programming: Python, Cybersecurity, maybe some Data Science on the side as was related to my degree
- Languages: Japanese, Russian, French

Yes I am aware that this is A LOT. But it's all stuff I really want to commit to over my next ten years. I have around 1hr-2hr of free time after I get home from work and gym. Exercise is non-negotiable time and was the main factor in making me realise how much time I had wasted. Most weekends I'm travelling to see friends or generally being sociable as a product of this existential crisis . With all this in mind, how do I approach this ten year self-improvement journey? Is there advice from people on this subreddit who are or were in a similar position?

My current thought process is, I either choose 3 things from each ""strand"" to do in my spare time for 30-45mins each so I'm doing a little bit each day. OR I do a big session each day of one ""strand"" (Music, Programming, Languages) for 1hr30mins then rotate through each activity in the strand throughout the week.

It is a lot, and I might end up looking like a master of none, but these are all things I am interested in and passionate about. I'm committed to all these activities and I want to get the most out of my adult life before I settle down.

For context:
- I'm single
- My work-life-balance is pretty good (I can even do some programming and language studies as part of my work)
- I'm comfortable with my finances now
- I might be moving to a new job soon with not as good WLB
- I should learn how to drive on top of all this!

I probably look like a clown posting this, but any advice is appreciated! It was pretty hard to sleep last night thinking about all of it!",1644565476.0
Platteau of Self improving?,6,spvsj3,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/spvsj3/platteau_of_self_improving/,1,"Hello there!

I gotinterested in self-improvement years ago, where I was at a lower point to start what I was capable of. Of course I handled my way up again. It was easy because I could firstly remember what I was doing earlier and secondly because I could very easy figure out what works and makes sense.

&#x200B;

But since I reached this goal I remained stuck at this plateau.

But still want to make my life better, but I feel like not having the energy anymore.

Do you have any tips how to reach another level? would really appreciate it!

&#x200B;

EDIT: So for the ones that are interested, I just found out how to solve this.

(also: i was for a longer time resting, and cured a mental illness with that)

but what I found out is: to catch a good moment to visualize yourself as a new self.

So to get better you change your identity first (you will need a good mental moment to do so) so if you are trying to do more sport for example, imagine yourself being that person and if it feels bad at first overcome that feeling, by letting a good feeling come up for this habit.

&#x200B;

also: my new goal is to learn learning first off all instead of being disappointed by not digging deeper into a topic because I lost interest (cause theres no reward after a time anymore)

i will do this by of course looking at strategies and methods that are existing, but more I will experiment with creating methods on my own that fit me the best.",1644573240.0

How to deal with the unavoidable turbulence of life.,2,sq179i,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sq179i/how_to_deal_with_the_unavoidable_turbulence_of/,0,"A great life is built by establishing great routines. When you establish a strong routine you feel like a train picking up momentum as you roll down the track. Like Casey Jones, driving that train, high on… life.

Stacking several days, weeks or months of exercise, reading, writing, work or practice together is like laying brick after brick of progress. The cumulative effect turns into something substantial, noticeable and differentiating.

However, life isn’t easy on your routines. You will regularly encounter obstacles, events, and conflicts that disrupt your flow, Jo. This turbulence knocks you around and attempts to dislodge you from your productive habits.

But remember, turbulence is temporary. A plane flies in and out of turbulence, which shakes the plane, throws the passengers about and halts the beverage and peanut service. That’s why God invented barf bags.

But turbulence is simply a pocket of disruption. One of the greatest skills you can develop is the resilience to snap back into your routine on the other side of the turbulence. After the travel, the cold, the work crunch, the Covid, the kid’s needs, or the big test you need to get right back into your best habits.

Don’t allow the turbulence to ruin your mindset. Continue to lean into your habit mentally, even when the turbulence compromises your ability to keep your commitment. Keeping the connection to the commitment is critical to maintaining the momentum. (Which is like two alliterations in one.)

### Key Takeaway

Turbulence is an unavoidable part of life. It will throw off your routine and threaten your habits. But hold tight to your commitments. And jump right back into your routine as soon as the turbulence passes. It’s how you ensure that your commitments always conquer your excuses. That’s how you win at life.",1644591194.0

I've attempted multiple times to fix my sleep schedule but I just kept on repeating the same pattern. Sleeping this way just makes you gloomy, low energy and more sleepier (but not at midnight). 

I can't get enough sunlight as well because I'm living in a gloomy/foggy weather location wherein sunlight was pretty rare these days. 

I'd also lean towards binge eating especially unhealthy snacks. Drinking sodas doesn't appeal to me before but now, it's one of my get aways. I'll over eat due to mindless snacking and I'll felt guilty afterwards.

I'm guilty of not sleeping regularly, being overfed but not nourished, procrastination and my underperformance in my academics. I felt worthless more and more but I don't want those to define me.

"The less outside noise, the more the signal within [the constant self]",2,sq4qk2,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sq4qk2/the_less_outside_noise_the_more_the_signal_within/,0,"Most days I wake up with the chaos of potential underdeveloped ideas popping in my head competing with each other. One overshadows the other, and in a matter of seconds a dozen of random ideas may suddenly pop into my head and perish into non-existence. I start doing my morning rituals of cleaning and finding piece, without the destruction of outside world, of “socials”, in the hope that throughout this session one of the ideas, within a clutter that pops randomly and uncontrollably deep within my head, will evolve, outcompete the others and shine bright.

Some days I wake up with a concrete understanding and desire to write a serene, gleaming idea. In others, like today, my mind is in a mess. And even after my morning rituals (which in their own right make me eager to write) are complete, I don’t feel the grasp of a tangible idea I can stand upon and do my bidding.

Alas, the word is an uncontrollable chaos, and till one finds the variables that he can control and tune in such a way that he is the best creative representations of himself, some considerable amount of time will pass. And just a few will reach this pure stage, as the attention deficit mind is always excited to see something new. And the new will always have its share of random and uncontrollable, which may derail us.

The more one is exposed to shiny new products and fads, the less he is in control of himself. The mind is an instrument for creation. To function on its best ability, it has lots of chemical and perceptual dials to be tuned, most of which we are not in control of. So much new and exciting random events, memes and news are concocted each day in “socials” and the attention deficit mind is eager to consume that sludge, so nothing is left behind unseen. As if he who does not consume it all will be left behind from the masses, the herd.

So much noise… So much random noise that can affect us, leave a mark and hinder us, sway us. The less outside noise, the more the signal within is discernible. The less one lets outside noise to control and mess his dials, the more hi is in control to tune them. The less is more.

The downside of affirmations,1,spy2uc,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/spy2uc/the_downside_of_affirmations/,11,"Affirmations have a very positive reputation in this community which is baffling to me because yes they do make a superficial improvements but the price for this is just too much.

What affirmations basically do is that you enforce something which is not inherently real through repetition and it's basically hypnotizing yourself or brainwashing yourself. I believe if you have issues with self worth you need to understand why those issues are there and observe how your mind works, what triggeres those patterns etc. The mind is a very sensitive thing and just raw dogging your way into feeling worthy is never gonna work and is dysfunctional and abnormal it's like when you see the victims of a cult that believe in some very irrational things because they were being told what to believe everyday from the moment they wake up until they sleep. A mind that is being constantly forced to think a certain way would lose it's sensitivity to life, joy and creativity. Point is if your mental foundations are shaky and are the result of deep burried psychological issues from childhood to whatever age you're in rightnow the wisest decision would be to adresse those issue at their roots not deluding yourself into believing otherwise. As this is a self improvement community it goes against everything this stands for because you've limited yourself into a psychological box in which you think and believe you're worthy but in reality what dictates almost of 95% of the way we think, feel and act is unconscious and it just screams worthlessness so what you believe and what you feel/do  are in opposition so you've just created for yourself another source of inward resistance which breeds conflict, rigidity and lack of creativity. If you want to to really dive deep in this journey of improving one's self, understanding your problems and basically go through the biggest life transformation possible then being direct and not lying to yourself is crucial. To conclude instead of affirmations learn how to observe the workings of your mind throughout the day and the more you understand about yourself the deeper you'll reach.

So if I were to find one even secretly my parents would have to pay for it and I doubt that will happen unless I’m diagnosed with something. 

I’m a senior in college and honestly it’s wild how I made it to this point but I feel like I’m crumbling to pieces day by day. I hear stories about how friends talk to therapists all the time and get self help and medication and it actually helps them. I want to go but I don’t know how. I’m on the school’s health insurance and thought maybe if there’s a way to do that’s covered by insurance. 

While also I want to go, I’m also terrified that the therapist will tell me nah you don’t have anything you have been lazy and overdramatic this whole time, but I guess thats totally fair. So yea I guess I’m posting to find ways to get access to it, maybe a closer step to actually going

“Cry For Help”

Deaths due to drug overdose have reached an all time high in America and there doesn’t seem to be any brakes on the runaway train. This is the reality we face in 2022, but the lost and forgotten in prisons across America deal with the same struggle. The difference? We’re property of the Illinois Department of Corrections. The cells we live in should be condemned! Cockroaches nest in the walls. The water we are forced to drink causes illnesses. IDOC says, “Nothing is wrong with the drinking water,” however staff and outside visitors are told NOT TO DRINK THE WATER. We need water to survive, but the commissary has not sold bottled water in 4 months. Dayrooms and yard times are denied due to short staffing. Just stay in your cells and dwell on Covid-19. Do not ask for help or complain. Stateville doesn’t care. Christmas 2020 we weren’t allowed in person visits – the vaccines had not yet been distributed. Christmas 2021, Stateville goes on a “Medical Lockdown,” due to officers testing positive. No visits from my 73 year old parents. December 24th, I’m watching the Wizarding and escaping into childhood memories of Harry Potter. Stateville, supposedly “Short Staffed” due to another covid outbreak, somehow has the officers to do cell shakedowns on Christmas Eve. I do my best to go along, not make waves, but I COULD NOT COMPREHEND why I was being pulled out of my cell at this time. As a man of faith I’m supposed to turn the other cheek, but what happens when you run out of cheeks? Taking “medicine” along with blood pressure pills was my remedy that night. Under the Covid-19 quarantine, I've tattooed myself from head to toe, been to segregation twice, and had debilitating depression and anxiety. Prison itself brings about isolation. COVID cut off all in person contact with the outside world. The lack of humanity and personal connection has been crippling for me. Will you help me keep my sanity in an institution that views me as nothing more than a product on a shelf that will expire and simply be thrown out? Will you step into my pain? Acknowledge my humanity and tell me that it’ll be ok?",1644539477.0

You Have To Be Willing To Let Go Of The Pain,6,spdvw7,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/spdvw7/you_have_to_be_willing_to_let_go_of_the_pain/,0,"We have to be willing to accept the fact that it’s gone, it’s over, it’s done - to be able to let go of the pain. 

This can be due to something in the past, or something recent - realise that the more you keep hold of this particular problem to my your heart and mind, the more painful it’s going to be. To many of us, we overthink something so much that we create this problem that isn’t even there in the first place. Instead of letting go of a mistake, we tend to live our life around it, because by doing so, we realise that if we keep it close to our heart, we won’t feel true pain as we are already living with it. 

But, that’s not how we live, right? We should be happy with the person we are and actually be exiting for the next day, not living in fear, worry and stress. 

Acceptance is the first part, the hardest part and the rest will follow. If you don’t accept that everything in the part is over, the mind will give you false-hope and by doing so, it will set you back to the pit of darkness. Everyone’s lives are different, we take different journeys, make different mistakes and have different regrets, but every journey, mistake and regret can be dealt with appropriately. 

To accept the fact it’s over, you have to let go of that one thing, or many things, depends on the situation you are in, and continue on with your journey. This can be a small blip, a wrong turn in life, but it doesn’t mean it’s over, not by a long shot. 

This chapter of your life will pass, and you will one day and look back at it in 2 different ways:

- 1) - A dark time of your life 
- 2) - A dark time of your life that saved you

You can look at your past as a way of pain, or a way of progress - that’s completely up to you, but the ideal mindset would be to take a look at it with a smile on your face and realise the hole you had to drag yourself out of, how dark it truly was, the fact you had to crawl yourself out with nobody else’s help, but just yourself. Now, to me, that sounds like one of the greatest accomplishments you can live with. 

You see the person who’s staring back at you while you’re looking in the mirror? That’s your toughest opponent, at times, your worst rival. You will go toe-on-toe with this person, you will share good times, but bad times too, you’ll go through hell with this person, so you just trust that person to make the right decisions, the right calls and the right judgement, and to do so, you must accept that persons past, that persons faults and mistakes they once did - accept it and let it go. 

Your mind must be stronger than all of the doubts you have inside of you. If you feel as if you’re going to do something that you shouldn’t, stop, think about it, analyse and see how you’re feeling now. 

One of the most important things you can do to make sure you move on in life is to accept and letting that torturous pain go from your mind and system. Letting go is hard, I understand that, I live in the same boat, but it is absolutely the right thing to do. If you mess it up today? Try again tomorrow. If you mess up tomorrow? Try again the next day. 

Keep on going, this chapter of your life will pass.",1644519123.0

I'm writing this post hoping that someone will recognize their own behavior and hopefully be able to start a discussion on why this problem exists, identify triggers, and come up with a plan to change it once and for all.

&#x200B;

I'm currently an average guy. Writing that out is extremely painful. Admitting it to myself is very difficult. I have extremely high expectations of myself, bordering on the impossible. When I set out to do something I go at it hell-bent to succeed, at **any** cost, even my own health. That is when I do it, which is very rare. I mostly spend my time with Netflix and computer games. My greatest role models in life are people like Arnold Schwarzenegger, David Goggins, etc. People that attack life with the mindset of an achiever. They set their goals and accomplish them. No excuses.

&#x200B;

The only time I am able to do that is when I'm about to lose something very dear to me. Like my girlfriend. A year ago she was fed up with my talk that never surmounted to anything. She told me it's over. I was devasted. Absolutely destroyed. I had my first panic attack in my life. I cried until I screamed. Then I got to work. Every awake minute of the day I spent working out, reading self-improvement books, writing down everything I was going through in a diary and processing it, I ate healthy as hell. Only chicken, white fish, sweet potatoes, broccoli. Not a molecule of sugar or unnecessary carbs. I went to bed every night muscles screaming with pain. I did that for about two months. Then I set up a meeting with my GF (ex at the time) to ""talk things through"". I planned a very adventurous weekend for us, no strings attached and had even rehearsed things I needed to tell her to make her notice I had reinvented myself. Well, she noticed. Next weekend we met up again and had the best weekend of our lives. Relationship and love sparked again. I was so proud of myself.

&#x200B;

But when I had achieved what I wanted I started spiraling down to my own self. No ambition. No achievement. No nothing. Well, I'm not completely useless. I have a high-paying job. I'm usually very appreciated for my work and have more good friends than I deserve. But I'm no Arnold. And I will NEVER be satisfied until I have maxed out my biological potential for muscle mass, learned new skills, and reached my goal of being able to live my life to the absolute fullest.

&#x200B;

This is what I don't understand with myself: Why did I end up this way? What in my life caused me to be ""average""? Why can I not motivate myself to do REAL change every day unless I have a gun pointed at my head? I expect myself to work out three hours every day six days a week. I expect myself to eat very healthily and only stuff that builds muscle. I expect myself to only spend time with stuff that brings me towards my goals of being financially independent, having a house, and potentially a family. Instead, I sit around and do bullshit crap like watching Netflix or playing games like an idiot. I have even started thinking about micro-dosing amphetamine because I seem to be biologically incapable of being a high-performing individual.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

For someone that seems stuck in the average and has a hard time motivating themselves to surmount to anything.

Scared to do things by myself?,3,spbmu8,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/spbmu8/scared_to_do_things_by_myself/,13,"First post here, been lurking for a bit but finally decided to ask something thats been bothering me for so long. 

I seem to be scared to do a lot of things on my own. The example im going to use is, i need to do an oil change on my car and want to do learn how to do it myself. Thing is, every time I think about going to It the voice in my head tells me im going to fuck it up, cause a mess, be doing it for 2 hours, just for an oil change.. unfortunately my car “friends” don’t seem to ever want to help me out and its hard to find people that would take the time to teach you how to do things like this. 

I seem to be scared any time something like this pops up. Car related or not. Not sure how to go about it but i want to change this scared codependent behavior i have. I feel like i cant do much by myself without some type guidance.  Im sure there are some people that feel the same. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!",1644513358.0
How do I become less hypersensitive?,2,sped87,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sped87/how_do_i_become_less_hypersensitive/,3,"I've had a pretty hectic life. These past few years especially broke me: navigating a toxic relationship, going through family issues, work problems, stressful student life, and other things.

Finally decided to break out of the relationship and minimize the toxicity from the controllable factors, which has given me time to reflect and work on myself. 

However, I've been extremely hypersensitive these days. It's been a thing for me for a while, perhaps because of various unresolved issues. But it's quite bad. I feel myself getting triggered at the smallest things. I haven't been doing great at work, and my boss (very kindly) nudges me to do better, and I am holding back tears, digging my nails into my arms, drinking myself to sleep later that night, etc. 

I wear my emotions on my sleeves too. So they can tell. And it's quite awkward for them I'm sure. 

I'm a fucking adult and yet I can't act like one. Every small thing ticks me off. How can I stop being so hypersensitive?",1644520292.0

Looking to get out quickly of low morale? Here's an idea and 4 ways to apply it today...,8,sp4v4a,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sp4v4a/looking_to_get_out_quickly_of_low_morale_heres_an/,0,"Hi there,

Stop for two seconds. When you feel bad and can't get out of it? Where are your thoughts? If you are like me, it’s:

* Backward: why me? Why this situation? it's so unfair
* Or forward but with a backward glance: Time where I (or my inner voice) imagine the worst-case scenario. (That rarely happen, by the way)

One idea.  
If you are looking for a way to quickly get out of this low morale, try this idea, ""The Possibility Muscle.""  
I read about it in Skip the line. Author James Altucher has used it many times to get out of acute depression. I'm fortunate enough not to have gone into depressive states, but I feel good every time I use it.

4 ways to apply it.

* **When you're down, look forward, not back**. No matter what your situation, the future offers you all the possibilities.
* **Become an idea factory** (The Possibility Muscle)**:** Take a topic for yourself or a loved one and look for 10 ideas to improve it. Not 4 or 6 but 10. I didn't say 10 good ideas, but only 10 ideas. After 6 it gets tricky, but that's when you work your muscle of possibility. Doing it for a friend has another advantage. By helping someone, you help yourself. It feels good to make someone happy.
* **How do you do it?** Grab a pen and paper and write down 10 ideas for improvement on a topic that interests you. 10 ideas to improve my sales? 10 ideas to improve communication with my wife? 10 ideas to clean up my house? There are no limits to your creativity.
* **Get started.** Start small, but start. If it's a complicated task, don't tell yourself you're going to finish it, just tackle the first action—even two minutes. Action breeds energy.

Remember.

Ideas rewire your muscle of possibility.

The state of creation knocks out the state of low morale.

Put the key in and start today.

Advice like this is always a helpful reminder for me, because I tend to overanalyze and get paralyzed by decisions.

Yes, there may be commitment involved in your decision, but most decisions offer the freedom to change course later. This doesn't have to be your life-long career. You don't have to graduate with the same major you chose as a freshman. A first-date is a long way away from marriage.

I (19M) am terrified of being lonely forever.,36,sou0rs,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sou0rs/i_19m_am_terrified_of_being_lonely_forever/,36,"I  (19M) act pretty confidently, I have a decent social life, but deep down, I'm incredibly insecure. Lately, I've realized that I'm desperate for a relationship, just so I know that there's not something wrong with me. I think I'm pretty self-aware, and I always try to improve myself, listen to people, etc. I've got a couple of close friends who trust me to talk about things with and vice versa. But I've never had any luck with girls, and I don't know why. I'm not in the best of shape but I'm not ugly,  I don't think. No one has ever said I'm doing something wrong, I don't think I've ever been pushy or anything. But every girl that I'm interested in doesn't feel the same. It goes amicably enough, and there aren't any hard feelings (that I'm aware of) but I've never been able to actually make it work. I was bullied extremely badly by someone I trusted when I was about 13, and have had a few friends really hurt me. I'm starting to feel like I'll never find my person because no one is attracted to me in any way. I must be doing something wrong, but I don't know what. I second-guess everything I thought I knew about myself. I'm paranoid that I actually creep girls out, or I'm too obvious and scare people away. I'd never ever intentionally do that but I'm just spiraling out of control. I just want a relationship, not for sex or any of that, but to just show that I'm capable of being loved. I'm not really worried too much about my appearance, but there's got to be something about my personality that I've missed that I need to fix. Am I too nerdy, and I too passionate about things? Am I too much of a romantic? Do I take things too seriously? I don't know. I don't want some stupid relationship based purely on hormones, I want someone who matches me. I'm absolutely terrified that I'll never be attractive to the type of person that I long for, that I'll never be worthy of whoever she is.

What I’ve learned about curiosity in finding direction,1,spfnhz,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/spfnhz/what_ive_learned_about_curiosity_in_finding/,0,"*PS. I have a TLDR, don't worry

1. Engaging with curiosity leads to direction.

Imagine that your curiosity is a hungry dog staring at food on your plate. You have a mixture of chicken, fries, steak and broccoli.

Weird combination, I know. 


Now your curiosity dog can't speak, but it can give you subtle clues as to what it wants. 


Whatever your curiosity dog is eyeing, you guess that's what it wants. 


So you feed your curiosity dog, and if it likes it, it'll keep eating and eating. If your curiosity dog realizes it doesn't like what it's eating, it'll refuse to take another bite. 


And sometimes, you can feed your curiosity dog the same thing it likes over and over again, but eventually, your curiosity dog gets full and tired of the same thing.


For instance, your curiosity dog is heavily eyeing that chicken. So you give it, and holy hell, that curiosity dog is going to town!


It's eating chicken after chicken like a mad man! After a long time of eating, your curiosity dog starts to get full and tired of chicken.

 

Your curiosity dog doesn't want the chicken anymore, but wait a minute. Look at those fries. They look mighty good now. 



Suddenly your curiosity dog finds its appetite again, and it wants the fries. After a few bites though, your curiosity dog is full. It took less bites of fries than chicken to get full. What gives?


Oh well. Your curiosity dog stops eating the fries. 



But oh man, oh man. Your dog smells the steak and that appetite comes rushing back. 



You feed your curiosity dog the steak, and guess what, it doesn't stop eating. It wants more and more, it loves the flavor! You keep feeding it. Your curiosity dogs goes on to eat that steak for years and years.


Will your curiosity dog get tired of the steak? Possibly, but it isn't tired of it right now. So your job is to feed your curiosity dog all the steak it wants!



Now what happens if you try to force your curiosity dog to eat the chicken and fries when it's full of it? Well, the curiosity dog would run away! 


No more eating. 



Even worse, what if you try to *force feed* your curiosity dog the broccoli it wasn't even eyeing.


Your curiosity dog will quickly learn eating is bad. It doesn't trust your intentions and stops trying to eat.


So how does this relate to you? 


You have natural curiosity that loves to be fed. Your curiosity, like a dog, communicates in subtle ways. We'll look into ways to understand when your curiosity is speaking later.


Your job is to indulge in your curiosity and feed it with whatever interests it.


Sometimes your curiosity will get full after a few days, weeks, or even months. But eventually, you'll find that thing your curiosity never seems to get enough of.  

In other words, you'll find a lot of things that interest you. Some will stick, most won't. 

When you find what sticks, you've found a potential calling. Follow it, let it direct you. 


2. Understand it takes time.   


You’re going to go through many interests with dead ends. Meaning, you’ll get intrigued in one thing, invest all your energy in it, and then just stop. 


For example, maybe you're interested in playing the guitar for a few weeks, then you swap over to learning a sport. Maybe after a month or two, you get into cooking and for some reason, you just can't stop cooking.


When that happens, follow cooking. Maybe it'll lead to a dead end, but maybe it'll lead to you deciding that, ""Hey, maybe I could be a chef!"" 


3. Don’t try to do something because of monetary benefits.

 Do it because you want to and it’s entertaining. In other words, don’t do it for a potential gain you can get. Do it because you’re genuinely interested in it.

If you're trying to learn how to code because you want to get money, you're not going to feel a sense of direction in your life. 


You're going to feel forced and bored. You'll feel overwhelmed at everything you have to learn that you really don't want to.

Don't force yourself to do anything you aren't interested in. Only do what is interesting. 

 Forcing yourself to learn a subject you don’t like is the best way to kill a love for learning. 

For example, I’d have to force myself to learn how to drop-ship because it’s not interesting to me. By forcing myself to watch drop-shipping videos, I’m eventually going to burn-out my desire to want to learn. 

So I’ll stop. 


*This is what school does to keep you away from continued learning once you graduate.* 

Rather, if I only do things I find interesting, I don’t have to force myself. My love for learning grows because I’m in control of what I learn. 

This is the reason I’ve dedicated three years to learning about psychology, spirituality, self improvement, business and more. Because I only read the books that I’m interested in. 

Remember, the curiosity dog won’t eat what you’re trying to force it, rather it’ll run away. 


4. Listen to your curiosity. 


*  Look at the things you normally watch. Like what do you search up on YouTube? 

Why not dig deeper into the topics?

For instance, I watched a lot of dog eating biologically appropriate raw foods (B.A.R.F) ASMR videos. 

I found the B.A.R.F diet a cool concept so I read more into it. I learned the different things a dog could eat and it’s benefits. 

Then my curiosity peeked at how to introduce a dog to the diet. 

Then my curiosity developed into dog training and I watched a ton of videos on that. 

Do I own a dog? No. But I was curious about the topic and when my curiosity eventually ended (after a few weeks) I learned a shit ton that I can now introduce to a dog once I get one. As well as a plethora of videos I can return to when its time. I also have more things I can talk about. 

If I see a dog lover, I can introduce the B.A.R.F diet, I can talk about dog training, about Cesar Milan, and grooming. (Yes, my curiosity led to all of that). 


* Whenever you see something someone is doing and you find it interesting, try it for yourself. 

I saw my friend juggling and I thought it was cool. So I decided to learn for myself. 

I spent six months getting better and better and thought I was bound to be a juggler. Eventually I came to a dead end, but I gained a lot of benefits from juggling. 

And it all started because I recognized a sign from my curiosity: I thought what my friend was doing was cool.) 


Anything that gives you even a blimp of, “oh that’s pretty dope,” or “hmm thats interesting” moments, FOLLOW them. That’s your curiosity giving you your lead.

 

* Pick up new hobbies. And yes, you can do more than one at a time.

For instance, for three years I was interested in trading because I was fooled into thinking I could beat the market and become a master trader and make money from my phone. 

I spent all day watching videos, taking notes, etc. 

Eventually though, I picked up another hobby of skateboarding. 

I still traded, but in the afternoon I skateboarded, and my interest slowly grew. When I got better in skateboarding, I let go of trading and put all my interest in that, but mind you, it took one and a half years for that to happen.  

My skateboarding interest started slow and grew overtime into a lifestyle. Then it surpassed trading. I took my skateboarding and I grew a TikTok page on that, and got noticed by my idols Aaron Kyro, Ricky Glaser, Kane Caples and Briana King!

It was really fun, I made a lot of friends and memories. But eventually I reached a dead end. That was about the time my self improvement lifestyle started picking up. 

And guess what? My self improvement was another small hobby I had going on during my years into trading. 

5. Don’t burn-out your curiosity. 

It’s easy to slip into the information overload phase and thinking, “oh I could do this and that with this topic! I could learn everything about it in TWO weeks, and teach it to someone else! I could become the best.” 

And then you overindulge your curiosity and now you’re burnt out and don’t care about it anymore. 

Instead, find an interesting video, maybe a book, or talk to someone about it. 

Take it slow. Engage in it, but don’t forget to look up and see the other parts of life. Go for a walk, hang with friends, make a home cooked meal. 

Give yourself distance between that interest. It will come back around and when it does, engage with it. 



6. Look for any related revenues from that interest and check those out as well. 

Different, relatable routes can make your main interest even more interesting and can add on to it in ways you wouldn’t expect. 

For instance, while on my self improvement journey, I was conversing with my friend who brought up the idea positive psychology: the science of happiness.

I thought it was cool, so I sped through three books about it. 

\[Bad move, I overindulged my interest and burnt-out from it\] 

I eventually stopped diving into positive psychology, but I did take the things I learned and implemented them into my self improvement and it’s helped immensely. 

Had I never taken the time to break from self-help books to learn about positive psychology, I would've never implemented PERMA into my life.

I'm so grateful I did.



7. When what you’re doing isn’t interesting anymore, let it go. Follow the next lead 

How to know it’s not as interesting? 

Your mind will start to look at other things, and you’ll feel like you have to force yourself to keep up the old interest. 

For instance, I was reading the book *Influence* by Robert Cialdini when I heard about the book *The Millionaire FASTLANE* by MJ DeMarco. 

I was more than halfway through *Influence*, but I felt like I had to force myself to keep reading when I really wanted to dive into *The Millionaire Fastlane*. 

That was a sign I wasn’t as interested in Influence anymore, and when I realized that, I put the book down.



8. Just because the curiosity dog doesn’t like chicken right now, doesn’t mean it won’t come back around again. 

Understand that old interests can come back.

This means, you don’t have to hold on to them. 

In my case, just because I put down Influence doesn’t mean at some point I won’t get interested in finishing the book. I can always pause and come back. 

The reason I didn't want to put down the book was because I felt like I *had* to finish it. I didn't think I'd come back to it and I was once very interested in it, so shouldn't I at least finish it? 

No! Because interests change.

Knowing that gives the freedom to put things down as you choose. 

9. Don’t be afraid to stop doing something you were once heavily invested in when your interest in it dies. 

**Key word: heavily invested.** 

When I realized I was leaning more towards self improvement and wanting to produce content around that, I struggled for months to let go of my skateboarding account.

I put so many months and hard work into it. On top of that, it was my first ever social account to grow.

Can you imagine how hard it was to let that go?

But I knew it wasn't something I was entirely invested in anymore. I eventually burnt-out as a result of my stubbornness. 

But I'm glad I did, because it forced me to realize I had to let go of that channel. I was at my dead-end. 

10. Understand the benefits of dead ends. 

You acquire skills and new understandings that you can put into your new interest. 

For example, trading turned out to be a dead end, but it taught me consistency, patience and emotional control.

I took all of that over to skateboarding. I practiced the same tricks for hours without progress and I did it patiently.

I knew over time I'd get the trick down.

While other skaters spazzed over not landing their tricks, I remained calm and continued to practice. 

Another example, making skateboard videos taught me how to edit videos, how to make a schedule and batch videos, how to generate ideas, how to get comfortable on camera, and more. 

Now that I'm moving over towards self improvement and building a channel for myself, I can take everything I learned from both trading and skateboarding dead ends. 

11. Understand again that it takes time. 

You might be interested in something for a month, and then find another interest in something that takes you all the way back to the start. 

And that’s okay. All that meant was you reached your dead end and it’s time to turn around.



* I spent my entire high school and college years invested in trading. But I reached my dead end and it was time to let it go. 
* I also spent a few weeks learning origami and can make cool shapes with paper. I quickly reached my dead end, but it was fun to learn.
* I spent six months learning how to juggle, and I reached my dead end when I learned how to juggle four balls.
* I got into running as a hobby and spent three months preparing to run at 7K. Once I ran it, I was at my dead end and went to something else.

All those dead ends taught me more about myself and other lessons I can take into the future. 

12. Understand you’ll eventually find something that your interest doesn’t fade. 

You'll run into a ton of dead ends that you once thought was going to go on forever. 

I couldn't have foreseen that after a year and a half of skateboarding would result in me losing interest in it. At the moment, I just thought it was fun to do.


Consequently, I couldn't have foreseen that self improvement would last and continue to interest me after three years. At the moment, it was just interesting to read about it during the spare time I had in my day.



Not all interests last forever. And that's okay! 

You could spend years on the same path and think that's the one for you. And then one day you realize it isn't.


We're constantly changing, nothing is stagnant. Our likes and dislikes, our values and mindsets grow as we grow. In that same sense, what you find interesting today, you might not find interesting a month from now.



And that's okay! Because you'll learn a lot from those interests and expand as a person. 



Enjoy your path and see where it takes you. Change paths when you know it's time.



13. When you do find that interest that never seems to fill, follow it.

Don't try to force where it takes you, just keep following it. Eventually, you'll stumble across your direction from that curiosity. 

For example, I didn't know that by reading *Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway* would send me down a spiral of reading psychology, spirituality, business, and more self-help books.



I didn't know I'd become a productive person, obsessed with building good habits and creating things to help other people. 

I didn't know I'd start waking at 5 AM to meditate for 30 minutes a day, or that I'd track everything I do, or even go partly vegan!

I didn't know all the knowledge I'd eventually obtain over the three years.



I just thought the book was interesting and I was like, ""huh, lemme read another book like this and see if its just as interesting."" 



And now here I am. Posting with the intent to help at least one person with finding their life's direction. 



Who would've thought? Certainly not me. 


14. Mastery

And finally, I want to talk about mastery. Because mastery fuels passion.

When you get good in something, you don’t want to stop. But it takes time to get there, you can’t rush the process.



 For instance, while I was trading, with a budding interest in skateboarding, I didn’t immediately devote 8 hour days to skateboarding. 

I wasn’t that good in it. I could barely push. I skated as a small hobby to just get from point A to point B. 

When I got comfortable with the basics of riding, then I started trying different ways to flick my board into my hand to get better. 

After a few months of building confidence, I bought a real skateboard (I had a cruiser at the time) because my friend convinced me and I started skating. 

I still wasn’t completely dedicated in it, but it was fun learning small new tricks with my friend. 

Once I learned how to ollie though, and saw my progression rising, my interest and passion for it grew. I got to the breaking point, and suddenly I wasn’t interested I trading. 

My attention was on skateboarding. So I kept skateboarding and having fun. 

After a few more months I got the idea to start a skateboarding TikTok. 

*Key words: after a few more months.* I didn't immediately think ""Oh, TikTok!"" Nah, I was just had fun and learned more.

And the idea of skateboarding on TikTok came because I'd get clips of my tricks and send it to my friends.

They liked it and I enjoyed the editing process. That's when TikTok came into my mind.

So I did that. And I spent months growing my TikTok, and building a following. 

And it was fun! I even got some passive income from it. I didn’t go into skateboarding with the plan of building a page about it on TikTok. 

And take my self improvement journey for example, it took three years before I decided to take it serious.

I started reading into self improvement during the time I was trading, skating and growing my account! 

I had no clue where it would take me, I had no goals of wanting to make money off self improvement, I just liked it. And I dedicated a small amount of time in the morning and night to indulge in those interests. 

At the end of those three years, though, I felt a sense of mastery in the topic. 

And it was confirmed from the different reactions I was getting from daily conversations. 

People said I always empowered them whenever we spoke, 

I motivated my friends to start thinking about making businesses not by telling them, but simply through my actions. 

Even my mindset changed. I was more focused on giving advice, helping others tame their bad habits and giving practical tips on it. 

I loved to talk about goals and help people to start thinking about theirs, as well as encouraging them to start small.

Others started coming to me in secrecy, talking about things I said that made them reflect on their lives. 

That’s when I realized I was really knowledgable in self improvement and it made me want to share that knowledge with more people. 

That’s when I found my direction. 

That’s when I dedicated the time and energy into writing blogs every day and intensely reading books / listening to empowering thought leaders to fill my mind with more information that I could share. 

Now I’m beginning to make YT videos and Tiktoks to spread more of my ideas and potentially help people. 

And even better, all the dead end interests I have are helping me out in some way now.

But again, all of that took three years of a mere interest that progressively grew into a lifestyle. 


TLDR: Find what interests you and learn more about it. Some interests will fade away in days, weeks, months or years. When your interest fades, find another. Eventually you'll find one that doesn't fade out. And when you find that, you eventually start building a sense of direction in your life.

Isn't it amazing? Isn't it an amazing companion that you have for the rest of your life? One you can count on to keep you life going, which is the most precious thing we have?

Why hate a body that has shown so much love through your life? Who taught you that you should hate it? Who benefits from you never being satisfied with your shape, your face, the battle scars you should be proud of? Because certainly hating it is only a loss to you. But someone else is making a lot of money over this hatred.

Beauty is not pain. Beauty is when against all that society has taught you, you are able to give your body a little bit of love, in the form of rest, water, food, sleep. A little self-care goes a long way. Don't shy away from that photo or that bikini. Don't let the judgment of others be your reality, but only a nasty opinion (as it is).

You deserve better than hating the body that has been fighting every battle with you. Show it some appreciation today, in any way you can, even if it is a small act of self-love. Small acts of love are what saved many people's lives and they can start a revolution in the way we see our bodies.

Time to let self-love bloom inside you. 🌷",1644482458.0

"I don't know if I want to ""follow"" my dreams anymore",2,sp873b,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sp873b/i_dont_know_if_i_want_to_follow_my_dreams_anymore/,7,"Probably a lot of people in this sub would agree that bunch of us raised by our family with the idea that we're smart and capable of studying and learning all the things any discipline that we want to. I was one of that bright students as well. But I guess growing up with the idea that you don't have to work on things to accomplish some things did not effect me well. 

Well, my parents didn't have any higher education degree but they did their best to encourage and support me and my brother financially and motivationally about getting a proper education. I am the first child. I was a pretty curious girl and even though I didn't put too much effort on studying during elementary and middle school, all of my grades were pretty good. I was good at learning a foreign language, I was good at maths and science, I had writing skills and I painted a lot back then. I was curious and interested in a lot of different things. My teachers would adore me although I was not a very social child, I was always kind and helpful to my classmates etc. 

Everything went well till I hit the puberty. Everything went shit all of a sudden. So my academic life... I've been zooming out all the time, I couldn't study at all, I've been pretty depressed and anxious about my thoughts (about 7-8 years later I was diagnosed with OCD), I couldn't keep myself interested in school. But my parents, my other relatives and all the other people that knew me well kept the idea that I will be going to places. And I've always worried that I was going to disappoint them.

I graduated high school. I didn't know what to do, which path to follow. I just knew that I love to learn new things and different systems/mechanisms. I've been thinking about studying linguistics, couple of months later I changed my mind and decided to study molecular biology and genetics. After a year, I started to study chemical engineering. At the end of the first semester, i said ""This is not for me."" 

Now I'm a 24 year old microbiology student with no enthusiasm, curiousity and a will to graduate. I've always dreamed that I would keep my enthusiasm about learning. I don't want to do anything right now. I've tried pretty hard to get out of bed and trying to get my shit together. Even thouh it went well for couple of months it always came to an end. I don't want to be a scientist, I don't want to be in academia or work in a laboratory of a food company etc. 

But there's this feeling inside me that says it's not too late. You still can be a scientist. If I can accept that i am simply a lazy person and I'm not that smart I can move on and let go of these dreams. I'm really tired. And I don't know what to do.",1644504287.0
The chaos of serenity within my brain [the constant self],2,spc30e,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/spc30e/the_chaos_of_serenity_within_my_brain_the/,0,"I cannot hold all the spontaneous thoughts that pop inside my brain. The capacity of human brain is limited and it tends to forget. If you ask me to recall what I have written in the previous days I will have hard time. I’ll remember but a few of the last ideas I have written. The daily rituals and habits I have enabled allow my attention deficit mind to stay focused, stay on track. I am still eager to start putting my thoughts to paper every morning. I hope this pace will last for a considerable amount of time. I am keen to write every morning. I rave the engine of my mind gradually with morning rituals, that contain minimal amount of outside destruction, only the familiar. And at the time I sit to write the engine is already hot and ready to spark. And when sparks fly, I am ready to catch them with my medium of writing. And the words start to flow automatically, as if I have a connection with deep within. I don’t think much at this stage, the words just flow through my fingers. And if I haven’t found my medium the constant stream of my soul that wants to give itself to the canvas of expression would have been lost. That is way I do this.

I did not expect I will write about my process today. I did not expect 10 minutes ago, when I just was about to start writing that those words will come out from my fingers. Only the first sentence I have wrote today was stuck with me the last 5 minutes before starting to write.

My mind was chaotic this morning. I was trying to cling on and develop past ideas. I wanted to continue to write about the daily footholds. Yesterday, after a productive writing session I made myself to stop, as I do not want to do this throughout the day. I will burn out. Some ideas were floating inside my brain. Which if I give a chance and commence to write, I am sure would develop, and flower.

I do not like those words: “would”, “would have” or “should”, “should have”. It has a taste of wishful thinking, of a hindsight, which I despise. So many people are caught up in their past. So many people straggle with that mindset, and cannot see their present or their future; cannot see the small things that lead to the path of contentment. *I do not want to develop this strain of my thought for now. I don’t feel like in today’s chaos that is in my brain I can surmount a proper text about this matter. I will leave this topic for the next time. (Which I don’t know when I fill right to write about.)*

Deep within I know why I feel this chaos of random thoughts uprising inside me. I could not reset myself properly with my morning footholds or rituals this morning. The day before was unusual for me and I was stuck in meetings from the midday to 5pm. I have not been able to read and rest properly throughout the day. And this harbors a lurking danger within it. The danger of stopping the strike of consecutive days. The danger of my attention deficient mind to succumb to its old ways of procrastination. This shall not be.

*I feel like this is enough for today. I do not feel right to continue. This is not a game of grind. This is the continuous game of refinement, discipline and self-improvement. And now I will have the discipline to stop. To be hungry for more, to continue tomorrow. Till then.*

How mindfulness impacted my life,7,sp02jp,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sp02jp/how_mindfulness_impacted_my_life/,0,"As the title says, I'll keep it short. I was a socially anxious nihilistic teenager with suicidal urges. Inability to connect with people, always felt isolated and I had less confidence than a rock. I started mindfulness 2 years ago but it was just on and off because I didn't understand deeply how it could help me but only theoritically and some brain benefits which are cool but the reality of it is much deeper than that. What I've found mindfulness to be doing is that through being present and observing yourself you start unraveling thought patterns that are created due to inattention. A little example to make this more clear, let's say someone has social anxiety he or she gets in a situation in which they encounter a group of people they start feeling anxious then their mind would start to race in order to run from that anxious feeling which is done through daydreaming or something of the sort, so in this attempt to escape there is a mental effort and when there is effort there is a result if you put a bit of effort in your hand you will move from A to B. In this case mental effort would lead to your anxiety growing a bit more than it used to. However, in mindfulness you just see how the your mind runs along but you are not inattentive you're present thus there is just this direct observation of what is happening. Thus, the result in the example would be your anxiety, your self-hate or any other psychological issue stop growing in intensity but the opposite in your observation  you begin to understand them and this understanding is what puts and end to the problem. A clear distinction must be made between understanding and knowledge. Someone who was blind from birth has knowledge about sunsets whereas for the one who sees only that direct observation of a sunset is enough to understand which requires no words just a simple seeing here and now. Give it a shot, just make sure your body is getting eveeything it needs, some deficiencies in micro nutritions affect the way we feel so we need to make sure the physiological part of the equation is taken care of through a healthy balanced diet, water, sunshine and exercise.",1644475580.0

According to the Egyptian education system, that puts me in the final year of preparatory stage (next year is highschool/secondary education). And up till this year I was a top performer. 

This year I slacked off, I underestimated everything and thought I'd pass without working hard. Oh was I wrong. My grades are fucking awful. I am not sure how this works, I got 77.5% whilst the passing grade is 78%. Now you might think that it's just half a percent, but I never got lower than 90% till now.

There's a chance I pass/make it to the next year if that's not how it works. It could be that the 78% is a total for first and second term (these are the 1st term results). But if that isn't the case, I don't know what the fuck I'll do. We're not the richest family and I don't want to make my parents for a second year of mine. My entire life is ruined, I can't go to school, and I have 0 hand skills that would give me  sub bar job. That's aside the fact that I'm a fucking idiot and won't get accepted anywhere anyways.

Besides that, even if they were to pay, being the only one from my friend group who's still in 3rd prep would probably destroy me mentally, I have friends from the year before too, so I'll be with them in the same class.

Trying to find acceptance in moderation,3,sp3fgv,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sp3fgv/trying_to_find_acceptance_in_moderation/,0,"It struck me again last night, while I was working later than usual because some of my analyses did not go as planned and I wanted to end the day by a positive note. 

While I was optimizing the code in R on the diner table, my partner was waiting for me to put it aside and use the remaining 20min to have diner together, before I had to get ready for another online meeting for an organization I'm volunteering at.

Right there, at that moment when I saw the worries on his face I realized once again I am trying to do too much. 

Despite meditating and going to therapy, I keep on seeing myself as a failure if I don't provide good results from my analyses all the time, if I say no to meetings for an organization I support, if I only go to the CrossFit 2x a week instead of 4x, if I overeat too much on certain occasions and feel myself slipping into disordered eating habits again. 

I always aim for perfection, because if I don't, I feel like I don't even deserve to say I tried my best. ""You don't have to be perfect in everything"" my partner says. He's right, I don't have to and I don't want to. ""You always have much higher demands for yourself than for others. Try to talk to yourself like you would talk to me""

So that is what I will try to do. Be more content with moderation, lowering my own expectations and be more compasionate towards myself. Trying to accept that, even if I don't aim for perfection, I can still tried my best.

Hey, my name's Adam.  
I'm 17, turning 18 this year.  
For the past two years, I've been struggling with school. I can't force myself to study, I have an endless list of missed assignments, skipped homework, and no motivation whatsoever.  
When I say ""no motivation"" I mean it, I don't even enjoy video games, or yeah, anything anymore.  
I guess I'm burned out after years of trying to achieve something, only for me to fail at almost every single step going up to my goal.   
I have no talents, except my English, people say I'm good at it since it's my second language. The only thing I could do was video editing, but i wasn't really good at it anyways.  
**Every subject at school is a pain in the ass for me, and 24h is just too little to fit every single one of them into my non-existent schedule.** Hence why I feel kind of useless, people laugh at me, saying I'm dumb, and then when I talk to others they always ask me why are my grades so awful, saying I'm smart and that I can do better, I'm confused.  
All I do these days is lie in bed, trying to learn the bare minimum to pass, and thinking about what used to be my plans - now it's just distant ""dreams"" from my past.  
Covid played a pretty big role in this, well, it just reinforced my procrastination, etc. I spent the last month in quarantine, I've been to school 3 times, only to get sent back to quarantine. As you can imagine, with the lack of classes, and only a few teachers actually willing to help me with the fact that I couldn't learn jack shit for the past month I didn't learn anything.

Q. What does it take to be great in life?,1,sp8ch8,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sp8ch8/q_what_does_it_take_to_be_great_in_life/,0,"We feel great when life looks great.
As soon as we get rid of fear, the quality of our life soars and it starts looking great. Consequently new and great possibilities for self-expression appear which we can utilize as per our heart's preference. Removing fear of the unknown does not mean doing crazy things. After all we need to preserve the physical body necessary for our evolutionary experiences. Using common sense while referring to the heart for guidance is always a great idea.

Now the question is: '’How to eradicate fear?""

One way is by learning to love life the way it ‘shows up' each moment of time. Instead of trembling of what is going to happen next, we can adopt a positive attitude of wonder. Something like :“ Let me see what this wonderful life has in store for me next.” Love has the amazing ability to transform the hardest experiences into something bearable and educational. By focusing on the lesson, we learn something, and at the same time the impression of the effect is mitigated to a large extent. We become courageous and hope comes into picture. That by itself reprograms our mind in a positive way and based on our positive belief sistem, positive things start manifesting in our reality. This happens because of the universal law of attraction: “Like attracts like"".

If we are discontent with life it is imperative that we clean our ‘house of beliefs' from negative junk and be very selective about what we choose to believe in. (Remember""Like attracts like""). It doesn't mean we have to agree with everything, but we can always express our disagreement or disapproval in way that doesn't offend others. Something expressed calmly but firmly has much more effect than an emotional response that often gets out of conttrol.

Getting rid of fear and becoming equanonimous is also achievable through spiritual practice. This state of existence can even be transmitted by someone who has attained the required spiritual heights. There is much written about this way of training on r/kamleshdaaji. It's worth mentioning that it is always free of charge.

In my humble opinion there is no quick fix. Dismantling old habits and negative conditioning requires a lot of moral fibre and determination from the seeker. It has been said that “Many are called but few are chosen”. What has not been said is that we are doing the choosing. Nothing is impossible for the aspiring soul, which begins to attract help from unknown sources as soon as it steps on the path of self improvement.
Finding a capable guide in life is an invaluable help and a major game changer!

They may not seem like big things, but they all pile up and the knowledge of all my mistakes is really hurting me mentally. I tend to be a perfectionist and I stress over everything I do, and I think the stress is causing me to make more mistakes.

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to avoid making so many little mistakes? I really try not to (read through my stuff 5 times, make lists, etc) but they just keep happening everyday.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644466483.0

"Are you the kind of person who rather avoids to open the bills or look up the exam results when expecting a bad outcome?

But I guess we all know how avoidance can lead to procrastination and more often than not just makes things worse. So here are a few suggestions on how to face these umcomfortable things:

* **Mental contrasting:** In this CBT technique, you first picture in your mind's eye what the best outcome would be when you put yourself to just do it. No matter the outcome, perhaps it's easy to deal with the situation once you have certainty. Or you feel relieved or perhaps even happy when things turn out to be better than expected. Second, you also visualize what happens if you don't do it - what's the alternative? Maybe you discover that this tension or bad conscience becomes even stronger? Becoming aware of the discrepancy is very helpful to get going and face your fears.
* **Reward yourself:** Of course it can also help to have something in mind that you can reward yourself with afterwards. 
* **Reflect on past situations:** Can you think of similar situations in the past where, in the end, things turned out just fine? What do you learn from that in retrospective? How can this situation help you approach the current challenge with more optimism?

How To Work On Yourself,3,soqikl,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/soqikl/how_to_work_on_yourself/,0," 

#  How To Work On Yourself

### Your guide to become the best version of yourself

The best journey you'll ever experience is the journey of self improvement when you make a decision to reach your highest self and become the greatest version of you,only then you can commit to whatever it needs to be done.you just need to believe that your hard work will pay off.  


#### Here are 8 things you need to do when you're working on yourself:

### 1-Recognize your toxic traits

no one is perfect ,we all have issues and toxic traits that most of us don't even recognize because we are deeply involved in only confronting the best picture of us and hiding our worst,though,by doing this,we are suppressing our true identity and nature,thus we can never be able to be ourselves or experience life properly.  


### 2-Eliminate the barriers inside your mind

our thoughts are not the reality,we can never see reality as it is until we clean our vision by eliminating the thoughts and beliefs that keeps us away from seeing true life and moving forward.these barriers are self-made and are only meant to obstruct our sight ,so we need identify them and work on getting rid of them.  


### 3-Build trust within yourself

this only can happen when you feel safety and peace within you,trusting yourself includes listening to your inner voice and believing it,trusting your plans and believing in you when no one else  does.this builds a strong bond with yourself that allows you to become decisive about your next step and move more smoothly towards what you desire.  


### 4-Visualize your goals

everything imagineable or the mind can think of,can easily happen in real life,thus,you can start visualizing your goals with every little detail  as if they are truly happening right now.through this process,our conscious mind is convinced that your specific goals will most likely happen,at the same time,it strenghtens your beliefs about the possibility of it happening.you just need to work on it as if it's already yours.  


### 5-Leave your comfort zone

no improvement can come from staying in your comfort zone,on the contrary,our comfort zones are the primary cause of our stagnation in life,because it hinders us from taking a leap towards doing something that might completely change us and our life.our comfort zone may be an activity,a thought or a habit,and sometimes we don't even notice it,until we look closely.  


### 6-Stay curious

life is all about asking new questions everyday,and the process of looking for the answers is your lifelong journey.so make sure to open your mind to acquiring knowledge everyday from inside and outside you.curiosity is an exercice for the mind  that helps connecting us with limitless answers,and thus,shapes us to become exactly what we're destined to be.you should first work on answering the questions about the inner you in order to open the door for answering questions about  what's outside  you.  


### 7-Seek permanent pleasures

never put extraordinary effort on temporary life pleasure that won't benefit you in the long run,instead plan ahead and let your present actions match your plans for the future and the type of life you're seeking.  


### 8-Be responsible for your life

pick wisely your life choices because the smallest decision can push you forward or backward that's in your hands.try to seek more what benefit you in terms of improvement,learning and pleasure,and make sure that the choices you make are a reflection of your ambitions and goals and what you're preparing for your future,meanwhile,avoid everything that distracts you from setting your mind on that goal.  


### Conclusion

there is only one person responsible for the quality of your life and that person is you,your true life will only begin when you start acting according to your life's purpose,so bear in mind that your life depends on you ,and there will always be work for you to do if you want to keep moving in life.

Increase the Probability of Achieving Your Outcomes with This Simple Perception Hack,5,somnzn,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/somnzn/increase_the_probability_of_achieving_your/,0,"Would you like to dramatically increase the probability that you’ll achieve your desired outcomes?

If yes, one of the most important determiners lays in how much you want to do the things you need to do.

When you think about the things you need to do to accomplish your goals how do you feel?

In my experience most people feel great when focusing on the desired end-result and imagining all of the great feelings that will come along with it…

However, when it comes to thinking about their necessary action steps they elicit themselves into states of aversion which supports them in procrastinating and excusing themselves from action.

Would you like to test this for yourself?

Take a moment to think about one of your ‘elusive’ goals that never seems to actualize. Now think about taking the required action steps and notice how you feel.  Are you associating negative emotions with the action steps?  

If yes, the great news is you can understand why you’ve been avoiding action.  It makes perfect sense. Anyone who is associating negative emotions with a behavior or habit would most likely do the same!

Are you ready to change this orientation?

Let's take some time to imagine bringing joy and pleasure to the action steps. 

Here are some questions to support you:

* Do you know anyone who enjoys doing that activity?
* What would it be like to do the task if you were them?
* What is it like when you imagine yourself taking that action with joy?
* What else can you do to support yourself in making that task more enjoy-able?
* When you bring joy to that process how much does it increase the probability of you taking action?

When you intentionally take time to imagine enjoying the process the probability that you will follow through with those actions will dramatically increase which greatly increases the probability of you achieving your goals.

Beyond that, when you imagine bringing more joy to the process (rather than focusing so much on the end state) the journey becomes much more enjoyable regardless of whether or not you actually achieve your goals.  This benefit is extremely powerful because whether or not we achieve anything in the outside world is never 100% in our power so we might as well enjoy the process!

When we bring more joy to the process we start to build up a track record of success… Not a track record of success in achieving our end goals, but a track record of success in terms of following through on the things that we set out to do and doing them with more joy and pleasure.

Powerful, yes?

Let me summarize the process for you…

1. Think of a big goal you’ve been wanting to accomplish but haven’t been taking action towards with the quality you would like.
2. Think of a leveraged behavior that, if you were to take it more consistently, would bring you closer towards your desired end state.
3. Imagine taking that action with a state of joy.
4. Practice this regularly until your default becomes to feel pleasure when thinking about taking the desired action.

Seems simple enough, doesn’t it?  

Whether something is joyful or not is a matter of perception… whose perceptions are in your head?

The more joy you can associate with your important actions the more likely you’ll consistently follow through and the more likely you’ll get what you want out of life. Enjoy this process, let me know how it works for you, and I trust this will support you in creating a more enjoy-able life journey.",1644437412.0

How To Find DIRECTION In YOUR Life. (My 2 cents),1,sox0ut,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sox0ut/how_to_find_direction_in_your_life_my_2_cents/,0,"*PS. I have a TLDR, don't worry.*

Hey! I posted earlier about finding direction by getting a goal on this forum and some others, and I got really interesting feedback. I realized I skipped A LOT of important steps between finding that goal.

I skipped it because I had already gone through the process, it was hard to imagine myself back in the shoes of literally not knowing. But I thought hard about it, and after soaking in the sun this afternoon, it came to me.

So here's my advice.

&#x200B;

1. Engaging with your curiosity leads to direction.

Imagine that your curiosity is a hungry dog staring at food on your plate. You have a mixture of chicken, fries, steak and broccoli.

&#x200B;

Weird combination, I know. 

&#x200B;

Now your curiosity dog can't speak, but it can give you subtle clues as to what it wants. 

&#x200B;

Whatever your curiosity dog is eyeing, you guess that's what it wants. 

&#x200B;

So you feed your curiosity dog, and if it likes it, it'll keep eating and eating. If your curiosity dog realizes it doesn't like what it's eating, it'll refuse to take another bite. 

&#x200B;

And sometimes, you can feed your curiosity dog the same thing it likes over and over again, but eventually, your curiosity dog gets full and tired of the same thing.

&#x200B;

For instance, your curiosity dog is heavily eyeing that chicken. So you give it, and holy hell, that curiosity dog is going to town!

&#x200B;

It's eating chicken after chicken like a mad man! After a long time of eating, your curiosity dog starts to get full and tired of chicken.

 

Your curiosity dog doesn't want the chicken anymore, but wait a minute. Look at those fries. They look mighty good now. 

&#x200B;

Suddenly your curiosity dog finds its appetite again, and it wants the fries. After a few bites though, your curiosity dog is full. It took less bites of fries than chicken to get full. What gives?

&#x200B;

Oh well. Your curiosity dog stops eating the fries. 

&#x200B;

But oh man, oh man. Your dog smells the steak and that appetite comes rushing back. 

&#x200B;

You feed your curiosity dog the steak, and guess what, it doesn't stop eating. It wants more and more, it loves the flavor! You keep feeding it. Your curiosity dogs goes on to eat that steak for years and years.

&#x200B;

Will your curiosity dog get tired of the steak? Possibly, but it isn't tired of it right now. So your job is to feed your curiosity dog all the steak it wants!

&#x200B;

Now what happens if you try to force your curiosity dog to eat the chicken and fries when it's full of it? Well, the curiosity dog would run away! 

&#x200B;

No more eating. 

&#x200B;

Even worse, what if you try to *force feed* your curiosity dog the broccoli it wasn't even eyeing.

&#x200B;

Your curiosity dog will quickly learn eating is bad. It doesn't trust your intentions and stops trying to eat.

&#x200B;

So how does this relate to you? 

&#x200B;

You have natural curiosity that loves to be fed. Your curiosity, like a dog, communicates in subtle ways. We'll look into ways to understand when your curiosity is speaking later.

&#x200B;

Your job is to indulge in your curiosity and feed it with whatever interests it.

&#x200B;

Sometimes your curiosity will get full after a few days, weeks, or even months. But eventually, you'll find that thing your curiosity never seems to get enough of.  

In other words, you'll find a lot of things that interest you. Some will stick, most won't. 

When you find what sticks, you've found a potential calling. Follow it, let it direct you. 

&#x200B;

2. Understand it takes time.   

&#x200B;

You’re going to go through many interests with dead ends. Meaning, you’ll get intrigued in one thing, invest all your energy in it, and then just stop. 

&#x200B;

For example, maybe you're interested in playing the guitar for a few weeks, then you swap over to learning a sport. Maybe after a month or two, you get into cooking and for some reason, you just can't stop cooking.

&#x200B;

When that happens, follow cooking. Maybe it'll lead to a dead end, but maybe it'll lead to you deciding that, ""Hey, maybe I could be a chef!"" 

&#x200B;

3. Don’t try to do something because of monetary benefits.

 Do it because you want to and it’s entertaining. In other words, don’t do it for a potential gain you can get. Do it because you’re genuinely interested in it.

If you're trying to learn how to code because you want to get money, you're not going to feel a sense of direction in your life. 

&#x200B;

You're going to feel forced and bored. You'll feel overwhelmed at everything you have to learn that you really don't want to.

&#x200B;

Don't force yourself to do anything you aren't interested in. Only do what is interesting. 

 Forcing yourself to learn a subject you don’t like is the best way to kill a love for learning. 

For example, I’d have to force myself to learn how to drop-ship because it’s not interesting to me. By forcing myself to watch drop-shipping videos, I’m eventually going to burn-out my desire to want to learn. 

So I’ll stop. 

&#x200B;

*This is what school does to keep you away from continued learning once you graduate.* 

Rather, if I only do things I find interesting, I don’t have to force myself. My love for learning grows because I’m in control of what I learn. 

This is the reason I’ve dedicated three years to learning about psychology, spirituality, self improvement, business and more. Because I only read the books that I’m interested in. 

Remember, the curiosity dog won’t eat what you’re trying to force it, rather it’ll run away. 

&#x200B;

4. Listen to your curiosity. 

&#x200B;

*  Look at the things you normally watch. Like what do you search up on YouTube? 

Why not dig deeper into the topics?

For instance, I watched a lot of dog eating biologically appropriate raw foods (B.A.R.F) ASMR videos. 

I found the B.A.R.F diet a cool concept so I read more into it. I learned the different things a dog could eat and it’s benefits. 

Then my curiosity peeked at how to introduce a dog to the diet. 

Then my curiosity developed into dog training and I watched a ton of videos on that. 

Do I own a dog? No. But I was curious about the topic and when my curiosity eventually ended (after a few weeks) I learned a shit ton that I can now introduce to a dog once I get one. As well as a plethora of videos I can return to when its time. I also have more things I can talk about. 

If I see a dog lover, I can introduce the B.A.R.F diet, I can talk about dog training, about Cesar Milan, and grooming. (Yes, my curiosity led to all of that). 

&#x200B;

* Whenever you see something someone is doing and you find it interesting, try it for yourself. 

I saw my friend juggling and I thought it was cool. So I decided to learn for myself. 

I spent six months getting better and better and thought I was bound to be a juggler. Eventually I came to a dead end, but I gained a lot of benefits from juggling. 

And it all started because I recognized a sign from my curiosity: I thought what my friend was doing was cool.) 

&#x200B;

Anything that gives you even a blimp of, “oh that’s pretty dope,” or “hmm thats interesting” moments, FOLLOW them. That’s your curiosity giving you your lead.

 

* Pick up new hobbies. And yes, you can do more than one at a time.

For instance, for three years I was interested in trading because I was fooled into thinking I could beat the market and become a master trader and make money from my phone. 

I spent all day watching videos, taking notes, etc. 

Eventually though, I picked up another hobby of skateboarding. 

I still trader, but in the afternoon I skateboarded, and my interest slowly grew. When I got better in skateboarding, I let go of trading and put all my interest in that, but mind you, it took one and a half years for that to happen.  

My skateboarding interest started slow and grew overtime into a lifestyle. Then it surpassed trading. I took my skateboarding and I grew a TikTok page on that, and got noticed by my idols Aaron Kyro, Ricky Glaser, Kane Caples and Briana King!

It was really fun, I made a lot of friends and memories. But eventually I reached a dead end. That was about the time my self improvement lifestyle started picking up. 

And guess what? My self improvement was another small hobby I had going on during my years into trading. 

5. Don’t burn-out your curiosity. 

It’s easy to slip into the information overload phase and thinking, “oh I could do this and that with this topic! I could learn everything about it in TWO weeks, and teach it to someone else! I could become the best.” 

And then you overindulge your curiosity and now you’re burnt out and don’t care about it anymore. 

Instead, find an interesting video, maybe a book, or talk to someone about it. 

Take it slow. Engage in it, but don’t forget to look up and see the other parts of life. Go for a walk, hang with friends, make a home cooked meal. 

Give yourself distance between that interest. It will come back around and when it does, engage with it. 

&#x200B;

6. Look for any related revenues from that interest and check those out as well. 

Different, relatable routes can make your main interest even more interesting and can add on to it in ways you wouldn’t expect. 

For instance, while on my self improvement journey, I was conversing with my friend who brought up the idea positive psychology: the science of happiness.

I thought it was cool, so I sped through three books about it. 

\[Bad move, I overindulged my interest and burnt-out from it\] 

I eventually stopped diving into positive psychology, but I did take the things I learned and implemented them into my self improvement and it’s helped immensely. 

Had I never taken the time to break from self-help books to learn about positive psychology, I would've never implemented PERMA into my life.

I'm so grateful I did.

7. When what you’re doing isn’t interesting anymore, let it go. Follow the next lead 

How to know it’s not as interesting? 

Your mind will start to look at other things, and you’ll feel like you have to force yourself to keep up the old interest. 

For instance, I was reading the book *Influence* by Robert Cialdini when I heard about the book *The Millionaire FASTLANE* by MJ DeMarco. 

I was more than halfway through *Influence*, but I felt like I had to force myself to keep reading when I really wanted to dive into *The Millionaire Fastlane*. 

That was a sign I wasn’t as interested in Influence anymore, and when I realized that, I put the book down.

&#x200B;

8. Just because the curiosity dog doesn’t like chicken right now, doesn’t mean it won’t come back around again. 

Understand that old interests can come. 

This means, you don’t have to hold on to them. 

In my case, just because I put down Influence doesn’t mean at some point I won’t get interested in finishing the book. I can always pause and come back. 

The reason I didn't want to put down the book was because I felt like I *had* to finish it. I didn't think I'd come back to it and I was once very interested in it, so shouldn't I at least finish it? 

No! Because interests change.

Knowing that gives the freedom to put things down as you choose. 

9. Don’t be afraid to stop doing something you were once heavily invested in when your interest in it dies. 

**Key word: heavily invested.** 

When I realized I was leaning more towards self improvement and wanting to produce content around that, I struggled for months to let go of my skateboarding account.

I put so many months and hard work into it. On top of that, it was my first ever social account to grow.

Can you imagine how hard it was to let that go?

But I knew it wasn't something I was entirely invested in anymore. I eventually burnt-out as a result of my stubbornness. 

But I'm glad I did, because it forced me to realize I had to let go of that channel. I was at my dead-end. 

10. Understand the benefits of dead ends. 

You acquire skills and new understandings that you can put into your new interest. 

For example, trading turned out to be a dead end, but it taught me consistency, patience and emotional control.

I took all of that over to skateboarding. I practiced the same tricks for hours without progress and I did it patiently.

I knew over time I'd get the trick down.

While other skaters spazzed over not landing their tricks, I remained calm and continued to practice. 

Another example, making skateboard videos taught me how to edit videos, how to make a schedule and batch videos, how to generate ideas, how to get comfortable on camera, and more. 

Now that I'm moving over towards self improvement and building a channel for myself, I can take everything I learned from both trading and skateboarding dead ends. 

11. Understand again that it takes time. 

You might be interested in something for a month, and then find another interest in something that takes you all the way back to the start. 

And that’s okay. All that meant was you reached your dead end and it’s time to turn around.

&#x200B;

* I spent my entire high school and college years invested in trading. But I reached my dead end and it was time to let it go. 
* I also spent a few weeks learning origami and can make cool shapes with paper. I quickly reached my dead end, but it was fun to learn.
* I spent six months learning how to juggle, and I reached my dead end when I learned how to juggle four balls.
* I got into running as a hobby and spent three months preparing to run at 7K. Once I ran it, I was at my dead end and went to something else.

All those dead ends taught me more about myself and other lessons I can take into the future. 

12. Understand you’ll eventually find something that your interest doesn’t fade. 

You'll run into a ton of dead ends that you once thought was going to go on forever. 

I couldn't have foreseen that after a year and a half of skateboarding would result in me losing interest in it. At the moment, I just thought it was fun to do.

&#x200B;

Consequently, I couldn't have foreseen that self improvement would last and continue to interest me after three years. At the moment, it was just interesting to read about it during the spare time I had in my day.

&#x200B;

Not all interests last forever. And that's okay! 

You could spend years on the same path and think that's the one for you. And then one day you realize it isn't.

&#x200B;

We're constantly changing, nothing is stagnant. Our likes and dislikes, our values and mindsets grow as we grow. In that same sense, what you find interesting today, you might not find interesting a month from now.

&#x200B;

And that's okay! Because you'll learn a lot from those interests and expand as a person. 

&#x200B;

Enjoy your path and see where it takes you. Change paths when you know it's time.

&#x200B;

13. When you do find that interest that never seems to fill, follow it.

Don't try to force where it takes you, just keep following it. Eventually, you'll stumble across your direction from that curiosity. 

For example, I didn't know that by reading *Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway* would send me down a spiral of reading psychology, spirituality, business, and more self-help books.

&#x200B;

I didn't know I'd become a productive person, obsessed with building good habits and creating things to help other people. 

I didn't know I'd start waking at 5 AM to meditate for 30 minutes a day, or that I'd track everything I do, or even go partly vegan!

I didn't know all the knowledge I'd eventually obtain over the three years.

&#x200B;

I just thought the book was interesting and I was like, ""huh, lemme read another book like this and see if its just as interesting."" 

&#x200B;

And now here I am. Posting with the intent to help at least one person with finding their life's direction. 

&#x200B;

Who would've thought? Certainly not me. 

&#x200B;

14. Mastery

And finally, I want to talk about mastery. Because mastery fuels passion.

When you get good in something, you don’t want to stop. But it takes time to get there, you can’t rush the process.

&#x200B;

 For instance, while I was trading, with a budding interest in skateboarding, I didn’t immediately devote 8 hour days to skateboarding. 

I wasn’t that good in it. I could barely push. I skated as a small hobby to just get from point A to point B. 

When I got comfortable with the basics of riding, then I started trying different ways to flick my board into my hand to get better. 

After a few months of building confidence, I bought a real skateboard (I had a cruiser at the time) because my friend convinced me and I started skating. 

I still wasn’t completely dedicated in it, but it was fun learning small new tricks with my friend. 

Once I learned how to ollie though, and saw my progression rising, my interest and passion for it grew. I got to the breaking point, and suddenly I wasn’t interested I trading. 

My attention was on skateboarding. So I kept skateboarding and having fun. 

After a few more months I got the idea to start a skateboarding TikTok. 

*Key words: after a few more months.* I didn't immediately think ""Oh, TikTok!"" Nah, I was just had fun and learned more.

And the idea of skateboarding on TikTok came because I'd get clips of my tricks and send it to my friends.

They liked it and I enjoyed the editing process. That's when TikTok came into my mind.

So I did that. And I spent months growing my TikTok, and building a following. 

And it was fun! I even got some passive income from it. I didn’t go into skateboarding with the plan of building a page about it on TikTok. 

And take my self improvement journey for example, it took three years before I decided to take it serious.

I started reading into self improvement during the time I was trading and skating! 

I had no clue where it would take me, I had no goals of wanting to make money off self improvement, I just liked it. And I dedicated a small amount of time in the morning and night to indulge in those interests. 

At the end of those three years, though, I felt a sense of mastery in the topic. 

And it was confirmed from the different reactions I was getting from daily conversations. 

People said I always empowered them whenever we spoke, 

I motivated my friends to start thinking about making businesses not by telling them, but simply through my actions. 

Even my mindset changed. I was more focused on giving advice, helping others tame their bad habits and giving practical tips on it. 

I loved to talk about goals and help people to start thinking about theirs, as well as encouraging them to start small.

Others started coming to me in secrecy, talking about things I said that made them reflect on their lives. 

That’s when I realized I was really knowledgable in self improvement and it made me want to share that knowledge with more people. 

That’s when I found my direction. 

That’s when I dedicated the time and energy into writing blogs every day and intensely reading books / listening to empowering thought leaders to fill my mind with more information that I could share. 

Now I’m beginning to make YT videos and Tiktoks to spread more of my ideas and potentially help people. 

And even better, all the dead end interests I have are helping me out in some way now.

But again, all of that took three years of a mere interest that progressively grew into a lifestyle. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Find what interests you and learn more about it. Some interests will fade away in days, weeks, months or years. When your interest fades, find another. Eventually you'll find one that doesn't fade out. And when you find that, you eventually start building a sense of direction in your life.

&#x200B;

I hope this helps! If you disagreed or agreed, let me know! 

(Also I'm not checking for any errors, lmao. I'm sorry. I wrote this on an empty stomach and now I'm going to run to the kitchen to eat).",1644465755.0

Talking with a mentor over the results what really stood out were: 

&#x200B;

* Topics where I’m an expert I’m comfortable leading, speaking up, giving direction. However once I      get outside of this comfort zone I tend to defer decisions, over analyze and if possible stay of it entirely.  This is driven primarily by a fear of confrontation, being wrong and/or letting others down. 
* I’m really good at rationalizing this behavior, and starting to realize some of my modes of operating that I've stood by for years are actually just excuses to avoid taking risks.  
* I avoid taking risks in both my personal and professional life - and it's really holding me back.

Now that I’ve identified this as an improvement area I’m wondering if there are any good books, Ted talks, blogs or other resources that might help as I dig into this a bit more? 

Thanks in advance for any recommendations!",1644432841.0

I was also unbeatable in arm wrestling. So I join wrestling thinking I would be awesome at it,but the practices killed me, I learnt that I just couldn’t wrestle I had trouble learning and remembering moves I was the always the confused guy in the room. So nobody wanted to wrestle with me except those who were kind of ostracized from group and would yell out aloud if I did something wrong  one day the training was so hard I almost barfed, I realized I had to take a dump during practice lol. But then I felt like  I wasn’t even enjoying wrestling neither was I good at it, or had anyone who enjoyed my company so I stopped wrestling. I really tried in the wrestling room but I found most of the time I didn’t have the motivation to fight back,I would just give up without wrestling proper. 

I wasn’t keen on having many good habits I used to binge watch tv shows from middle school to early highschool even. But I picked up I a good habit and that’s typing from a class I took in middle school, which I locked in so many hours just typing, but my progress is so slow that me practicing for years is prob equivalent someone’s  months. I’m typing at a speed of average 70wpm which sounds good but for someone doing it for years it’s just plain embarrassment!

Oh now as a Senior I have to think of my career and what degree. But again I’m limiting myself to such an extent. I wanted to become a mechanical engineer initially big dreams I have lol. I did really well is middle school math till algebra 1 I think I peaked after that my grade just fell to average B or high grades, but my precalc and calc survey dropped my confidence to a low D. Now I don’t even know myself to know what I want to pursue in life now I’m looking at accounting majors ha

Others problems i’have faced were social, but I understood the content of my academics I would definitely find my way.I was so good at learning things just a few years ago but now my knowledge retention and intelligence has dropped to any all time low, I’m struggling with Statistics which anyways I was very good at theoretical and practical math when I did Algbra 1 thro summer school. I’dint know how to explain although I feel like four year old self was smarter than me today in Seth t least, now I can’t even memorize the derivative which is the easiest.

Sharing Wisdom,3,somzs5,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/somzs5/sharing_wisdom/,0,"Sometimes life is hard. Even when life isn’t hard you may stumble into existential thinking. You may ask; “What’s the point? Life has so much negativity in it. Maybe I’d be better off dead so I won’t have to suffer, or pursue happiness that leads to inevitable suffering.” I know I have pondered this many times, despite having what most would call a good life. Fret not, I don’t mean to depress any of you. True, if you’re dead you won’t suffer…. but that’s not good! You need to suffer and you should want to suffer! Without it, how would we know happiness and joy? Even on your worst days, you should never wish to not be around, because as long as you’re here you can feel relief, things can get better. You can’t benefit from being dead and having no worries if you there’s no you to benefit from it in the first place! The root of all suffering comes from arguing with reality. Life itself isn’t good or bad. It just is. Why do bad things happen? Asking this is like asking why do cats meow instead of bark? It just is. Nothing is wrong with that! Good and bad are abstract concepts that don’t exist. They only do because we ascribe these attributes to things. Take a deep breathe, and accept reality as it is. Don’t fight something you can’t change when it’s fine as is. It’s not about changing the world, it’s about doing our best to leave the world as is while respecting the will of others and our own. And if we get lucky….if our faith in a greater being is strong then maybe one day we will all rejoice in paradise as one. Read this as many times as you need to. I know it can be hard given the presence of ocd, anxiety, depression, or a tragic event. But knowing is half the battle. Know this to be true in the deepest depths of your being and you will realize that we are our own gods. All in all, just fucking live life. I know it ain’t the holiday season anymore more still, peace, love, and joy to you all regardless. ☮️❤️🤩",1644438268.0

Whatever is happening that hurts and aches your entire being will entirely fade away. The part of you that feels everything so intensely isn’t a part of you that you should push away. 

You don’t have to apologize for your emotions. You don’t have to hide what you’re feeling. You don’t have to go through it alone. You have to release it so you can free it. Show up for yourself and show someone what you are truly experiencing within. 

Don’t hold it back. It’s going to be uncomfortable in the beginning, but the comfort you will find after is worth it. You are worth fighting for. You are a fighter and you must not forget that. 

Hope always comes when we open ourselves to the possibility that we really will be okay. A lot of the time life can be really difficult. But you cannot forget the moments it has been really beautiful and you cannot forget that some of your most beautiful experiences are finding you and are on the way. 

Listen, life is too short and delicate. 

Walk away from the drama. Walk away from anything that does make you the best possible version of yourself. Walk away from anything that makes you farther away from what feels like home-you are your home. 

You are your safe place. You can create space in your daily life that is full of love and joy and peace and anything that reminds you why being alive is a true gift. 

Don’t invite anyone or anything into your life that only brings you farther away from the peace that you deserve. Don’t lose yourself trying to save everyone else. 

You are the most important thing to focus on. I don’t want you to look back on your life and regret not choosing yourself over anyone else. You will continue to choose people who aren’t good for you if you don’t choose yourself first. You will repeat patterns that shouldn’t be repeated.",1644323040.0

There would be days where I would scroll on snap looking at what people were doing in their lives and I would sometimes feel jealous or feel like I’m missing out (especially if it was like a crazy event or party). Another reason I deleted the app was because I rarely ever use besides maybe texting, but even then I can just text from phone number.

Improve your friendship finding experience,2,sojf13,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sojf13/improve_your_friendship_finding_experience/,0,"Have you ever felt like you spent too much energy in meeting people to make friends only to discover the people you met don’t really want to get to know the real you?

Do they interrupt you? Do they let you talk on and on without an exchange? Are you afraid to bring up topics that are interesting to you?

I hope I can offer something that will make better use of your energy and help you find your tribe.

The past friendship patterns will be a good indicator of what you’re missing in the new lasting friendships that you’re looking for. Think back to when you’re interrupted or ignored in conversation, what are you talking about? What are some topics? Write them down, remember them and talk about them first and often. This is a small extremely important detail because this is your self expression—that is what’s important, interesting and exciting to you.

Watch how the people you meet respond to your topics. Then decide if you’ll continue spending your energy to befriend them.

A step further would be to ask yourself where do the people I want to talk to about what interests me hang out and find yourself spending more energy there.

accused of being rude/intimidating,1,somv7g,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/somv7g/accused_of_being_rudeintimidating/,1,"Hey,

So I'm like 6'5 and look like I am a bouncer whose had a tough paper around. I work as an engineer with a diverse bunch of colleagues who often come to me with frustrations. 

Over the years I've been accused of being intimidating, blunt or rude by several staff.

I personally attribute this to a couple of things:


My looks
Their stress
1000 of interactions a day they can't all be positive 
I've always mirrored others ie if they're nice I am nice, if they're abrupt I am abrupt.

What I struggle to understand is what I'm doing wrong.

When I'm accused of being intimidating I am sat down, low energy.

When I'm accused of being rude or blunt it's always factual based and often after I feel ive repeated myself several times. 

Finally I get paranoid because of two factors, it's often female junior members of the team, secondly it's only ever brought up when it's pay review seasons

"You are three dimensional, and believing otherwise is holding you back",3,soeog9,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/soeog9/you_are_three_dimensional_and_believing_otherwise/,1,"I overthink every social interaction, but that also makes me a considerate friend who people appreciate for being thoughtful. I get anxious when I don’t feel productive, but that also helps me accomplish more in 24 hours than a lot of people I know. Most of my weaknesses are the dark side of a two sided coin. What are yours?

We need to answer this question so we view ourselves fairly. If all I saw was social overthinking and anxiety about how much I accomplish, I would feel like a total wreck. I would assume I was doing everything wrong and my self esteem would plummet. But does it make sense to give myself no credit for maintaining good relationships and being productive? Not really.

The ultimate goal, in my opinion, is to accept ourselves where we are while still taking steps forward where we can. Self hatred is counter productive, conditional self acceptance isn’t acceptance at all, and complacency is not the road to your best life. Taking all of those off the table means we need to give ourselves credit for what we right while still being honest about what we can improve.

That’s why I want you to look for both sides of your own coin. Maybe you have struggled financially in the past, but that taught you lots of frugality skills your friends don’t have. Maybe opening up to people is very difficult for you, but you’re also incredibly self sufficient because you never wanted to depend on anyone. Whatever your story is, your weaknesses and strengths are probably very intertwined. 

Understanding brings acceptance, acceptance brings compassion, compassion brings growth. Hating yourself brings none of this. Instead of yelling at your crutch, you can get physical therapy and learn to walk again. Resenting my own insecurity and anxiety did nothing to fix it. Getting help processing the trauma that created those feelings did. Please take some time to see yourself in three dimensions; you won’t like the ending of your story if you can only see yourself as the bad guy.

**Further Reading:** If this post resonated with you, I think you would benefit a lot from *Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself* by Kristin Neff, PhD. Dr. Neff’s research shows how mindfulness can help us arrest unhelpful thought patterns, put struggle in proper 3 dimensional context, and focus on growth instead of perfection. This opens doors for growth that self-critical thought patterns don’t, and I hope it can help you as much as it helped me.",1644416314.0

Find your daily footholds (part 2),1,sojscw,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sojscw/find_your_daily_footholds_part_2/,0,"Please find the first part of daily footholds in my last post.

The  daily footholds are rituals done every morning that we can cling upon  and trust. In this ever-changing and noisy world few things can we  trust. And the things we set to do every morning; the things that come  from deep within we can trust. We should trust that they will remain  unchanged. That no matter how the circumstances may change, whatever  misfortunes the casual life may bring on us, there will always be  unchanged rituals we can rely on. Those rituals will not let our  emotions to sway us away. They will aid us in being accountable and  developing ideal work and life behaviors. And when we know we can cling  on the things we develop we start to trust ourselves. And people we care  for feel it and start relying on us more.

The examples of those rituals are:

**Make the bed.**  You are not making the bed for it to be pretty, though thoroughness  helps. You are making it as it may be the first task of the day, which  comes easy. It will reset you and mentally prepare you for the following  tasks of the day. You will already know you have accomplished something  before starting the day. And when returning home after a long and hard  day, the fact that your bed is made will bring some coherence and  content, which is another benefit.

**Shower.**  The time when we clean our body, mind and soul, from the dust  accumulated the day before. The time of tranquility, when the outside  world is shut close by the shower curtain and the constant sound of  running water calms us. (Do not shower hot).

**Brush your teeth.**  From the early age we are thought to brush our teeth. This mundane task  has a great power, as it remains unchanged. This is not a chore and  should not be considered as such. This is an important part of the day.

**Shave or put on makeup.**  The day begins and we may encounter lots of different people. We must  look our best to attract those who are in our interest and to put on  place those who may oppose us. And the external sight of tidiness helps a  lot. You should not overdo this part. But again, to each their own.

**Brew a coffee or make a tea.**  Do not just gulp the fast made beverage, in the rush that it will make  you fresh. The freshness comes not from the coffee but from deep within.  Beverages just aid that feeling, and in some cases, there is a placebo  effect at play, as one can reach the same freshness psychologically or  just by drinking a glass of water. Do not rush this. Instant coffee is  not despised because it tastes bad, it is despised because it does not  have the ritual attached to it. When done correctly this task becomes a  ritual. And the steps to carry it out become as important as enjoying a  fresh cup of coffee or tea.

**Stretch.**  This practice was done for millennia by our ancestors. In a way our  body is a machine that we mast care for and maintain. We should not  trash it in the frenzy of blind, self-destructing consumption. It is our  vessel. Do not overdo this part, you don’t want to strain yourself. The  movements must just flow and be natural. Just try finding yourself in  that flow of motions.

**Meditate.**  This ritual, may at first seem easy, but this is not for people who  want to find their footholds from the get go. Our mind is easy to be  destructed. Constant steam of messages and noises drift our attention  away….

**Pray.**  In the modern world religion is sometimes frowned upon. But our mind  and soul strive for the meaning and we want to be connected with  something that is bigger than all of us; to invoke the spiritual. If  this is the way for you to be content, rest and find meaning, then by  all accords this should be the ritual that you should cling upon.

**Walk.**  If you live in a place, where you can stroll, where there is not much  outside noise, then walking (without music or podcasts) before  commencing to work is the best way to let the mind wonder and open up  your inner creativity. You will find that this activity opens up your  inner creator.

Additional morning  rituals may include putting on the same attire every day. Plain blue  jeans and black sweeter must ring a bell. Preparing and eating a plane  meal that stays the same.

These is  not the full list of morning rituals one may find and preform. And it  should be stressed that one should not and must not do all of the  rituals every day. This will take considerable time and hinder the  willingness to continue doing those rituals. The things one chooses must  come seamlessly, as a second nature. Pick and choose a few. Cling on  them, see what feels right. Rotate them, till you find your ideal  formula. And if at some time in the future you get bored from one or a  few come back and try others. This should not become a chore. The idea  is to develop rituals to reset the day, and to cling upon.

Those  daily footholds may change when you start your journey, till you find  the ones that aid you the most in resetting the mind and soul for days  to come… Find the rituals that will become you.

I cut off my toxic sister and feel nothing but relief,19,snzmdf,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snzmdf/i_cut_off_my_toxic_sister_and_feel_nothing_but/,2,"I cut off my sister on the first of the month. 

The beginning:

My name is Joey, and I'm a 27 year old non binary person. I grew up in a horrible situation, along with my mom and my younger sister. 

My dad was horribly, horribly abusive. He wasn't usually physically abusive to me and my sister (there are a few exceptions to this) but he would manipulate and gaslight us, and when I was 15, there was one awful night where I was forced to participate in sexual acts.

Luckily, my sister is AMAB, otherwise my dad may have forced the same sexual abuse on her. 

My mom got the same emotional abuse but also, there was a lot of physical abuse that was directed towards her.

She cared deeply for me and my sister but our dad would gaslight us both to think terrible things about our mother and she was not allowed to spend time with us except to essentially be my dad's slave. For example, she was forced to come on vacations with us but ONLY to be the driver for the car we rented. She was not permitted to participate in the fun activities or to spend time with me and my sister.

My dad would do the same with our friends, manipulating us into thinking they didn't care about us and turning us against them. 

When I was in middle school, I brought a few friends home, and my dad came up to my room about a half hour later, telling me that her mother had said something (either racist or sexual, I don't remember) and he forced the parents and my friends to leave.

The effects: 

All three of us have dealt with awful trauma after we got away from my dad. Someone told CPS and they took my sister and i into foster care while my dad ran away from the police, I was 15 at the time.

We haven't heard from him since, and my mom fought like hell to prove she was a fit parent and get us back from foster care. 

Luckily, me and my sister had a foster family that cared deeply about us and was super loving. We were only there for about 10 months and then my mom got us back.

After that, I spiraled downward to the point where I had to leave school and be on suicide watch. I would go to work with my mom every day. I was scared to be left alone.

Eventually my mom decided I needed some serious help because she was so worried about me. She found an in patient program where teens went to work on their issues. (I was 16)

I went to the program simply to appease my mom and for no other reason. I stayed there for the next 3 years and was hospitalized once for a couple days for suicidal tendencies.

However, after a while of being there, I realized it was actually working. The school program was amazing, I was really flourishing, and the work we were doing was making a difference. I was getting better. 

While I was there, I got given medication and was even diagnosed with aspergers syndrome. 

When i was a kid, my dad came to me and said, ""Your mom thinks you're r****ded.""

It turns out, my mom knew I had autism and my dad actively refused to get me tested!

Three years later, I was released home, where I was able to go back to school and complete it.

I continued to go to therapy until my therapist retired, then we found a new therapist. I've kind of been bouncing around therapists ever since, but I'm getting better everyday.

My sister, however, was not doing well. 

She actively refused to get help. Every single attempt my mom made was met with resistance. 

Living with my sister was hell on earth. She basically yelled at everyone constantly and about everything, slammed doors, and smoked weed all day. 

I guess it's better than she smoked cigarettes, though.

I live in Canada, where kids can be kicked out at age 16. The second my sister turned 16, she was out. She moved in with my cousin for a year, and it was an awesome year, all things considered. 

I was so relieved. 

Doing anything during the time my sister was living with us was very difficult.

I almost never uploaded to my YouTube channel because there was almost never a quiet moment.

I wrote. A LOT. It kept me sane due to living with my sister being such a hellish experience. 

After my sister moved out I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I was soooo happy. 

After about a year my mom allowed my sister to move back in ONLY IF she signed a contract and complied with the rules.

It didn't last long, however. My mom has never been very good at drawing lines in the sand when it comes to me and my sister, especially when it came to my sisters abuse.

She just took it and my sister just continued emotionally abusing us. My mom was having a hard time finding a balance.

At this time, I wasn't very confident and I couldn't say anything to my mom about it.

I wished so many times i had. 

Also, during this time, I was having nightmares about a man who tortured and killed me. His name was Harvey, and my sister would deliberately say his name, and/or the name of the restaurant named Harvey's just to upset me. 

Either way, we lived like this for several more years. When I turned 25, my mom announced that it was time for us all to move out. I was so relieved that I would finally be free of my sister!

My sister bounced around to friends houses and sometimes hotels while my mom invited me to move into her guest room while I looked for an apartment.

It was such a relaxing time! I had forgotten what it was like to have an uninterrupted day. I was emotionally exhausted from all those years living with my sister. 

The stress was palpable. 

My entire demeanor changed after living with my mom for a few days. I was clearly happier and less stressed. 

A few weeks went by and things were good, however, then my sister dropped a bomb. She asked me if I wanted to move in with her.

I said I had to think about it, and we hung out over the next few days. She was a completely different person. I was so happy that I had a sister again! 

My mom kept warning me against moving in with her, but her words fell on deaf ears. I had made my decision.

However, I should have listened. 

As soon as I signed the lease, my sister started acting terrible again, exactly the way she did when the three of us were living together. I think she manipulated me into getting a place with her. 

It was awful. She had a friend that came over almost every single day who seemed to keep her somewhat level. 

She treated me like garbage, though. Luckily for me, freedom was just around the corner.

I moved in with my sister in around October 2019, and in March, a certain virus hit.

Due to that, my mom let me move back in with her. I was soaring high!

It was such a relief to be living with my mom again. My sister was my torment and my mother was a safe haven.

I've been living with my mom for two years now, and we are currently looking for an apartment for me.

Why I cut my sister off:

Soon after I moved out, my sister's birthday arrived. I had just gotten a $600 cheque due to covid. I wanted to get my sister something special because of this. I bought her $100 in playstation gift cards. (She was a huge gamer at the time).

She was really happy, however, about a week or two later, she sent me and my mom a bunch of angry texts about some stupid cheese grater. Apparently, I had HER cheese grater, and she thought I knew it and bought her all those cards because I felt guilty. She also called me names and was calling me a piece of s*it and stuff like that. I blocked her, deleted her texts, and decided not to get her anything for Christmas if this was how she was going to be. (I did though).

I found out that she was gay and was dating her friend (they are both AMAB).

Some time went by. I texted her every once in a while just to let her know I loved her. 

Eventually 2021 rolled around, and my mom told me my sister was trans but that my sister wasn't allowed to know that I knew.

At the end of the summer, I was going crazy. I told my mom she needed to tell my sister that I knew. My mom texted her and let her know.

Time went by, and in September, I broke my arm. It sucked. A couple weeks after, though, she texted me and we started texting again and even talked on the phone. 

I visited her and her girlfriend (who are both AMAB mtf trans) over the Christmas holidays and spent two awesome days together!

On Jan 31 or Feb 1st I posted a story about how our relationship was much better now! My sister found out and started sending angry texts. And yeah, I messed up. I made a mistake, I admit.

I tried to apologize but my sister just said ""Not fucking cool.""

I was getting ready to just leave it alone and ignore her until she had time to calm down and talk it out like adults. Also, I didn't want to angry text. That wouldn't fix anything. It would just heat things up more, and that's no good for anyone.

Then i got another text from her.

I deleted the texts so I can't remember the exact words, but it was something about the fact that she has cut off herself from the family because my mom was manipulative and I was a psychopath (I think) who had no empathy.

Now, one of two things were happening. Either she really thought that way, in which case, why would she want to have a relationship with that kind of person? Or she was just saying mean things, which is a shitty thing to do just because I made a mistake. Which, by the way, i apologized for. If she's angry, that's fine, but that's no excuse for calling names and swearing at me.

She also said something like ""This naive child act isnt fooling anyone"" and I'm sitting there thinking ""What naive child act? The act of realizing my mistakes and apologizing for them?""

Like, I recognized my mistake and apologized. Not sure what else I can do. Like, what does she expect, me to get in a time machine and go back in time?

Anyway, i should also mention at this point that when I saw my sister during the holidays, I apologized for what I'd done in the past. My sister didn't.

I didn't really care at the time. I just let me go because I thought our relationship was headed in a good direction and I didn't want anything to mess it up.

However, my sister keeps using excuses that she has trauma and anxiety or whatever every single time she messes up. She won't admit what she's done in the past and/or apologize for it.

She seems to think that she doesn't make mistakes, and she can use her anxiety/trauma/ptsd as an excuse so she doesn't have to take responsibility for her actions. 

After that text message I blocked her and deleted all the texts. I wondered how long I would have to leave her blocked for this time. But i slept on it and decided that this was it. It was over. She was no good for me and she was one of the toxic people that I needed to cut out of my life. 

I'd cut several people out my life at this point, including both of my ex boyfriends and a friend. 

I should add that my dad used to fly off the handle whenever we made one little mistake. Even when it was something that we fixed in some way (I can't think of how better to say it).

For example, I forgot to charge my phone the day before my dad wanted me to walk home by myself and he was going to call me and give me directions. I forgot to charge my phone, so I called my dad crying on the phone from the school phone. I got voicemail and he didn't pick up. 

I walked home all by myself and I was so proud! Unfortunately, my dad wasn't. He yelled at me. He made me write lines and grounded me, even though I had called him to let him know what had happened and walked home all by myself.

I wasn't proud of myself anymore.

Anyway my sister keeps doing the exact same thing.

I'm done with her forever. If she ever wants to apologize I will forgive her but I will never let her back in again.

I'm not posting this on a throwaway because:

1. I don't want it to be confidential and I want you all to know who it's coming from.

2. I want to know if my sister is keeping up with my reddit posts.

3. I want my sister to see this and know who it's coming from.

4. I'm hoping my sister will see this and get her s*it together. (Although I seriously doubt it).",1644366679.0

So you should put in more effort in your workplace when you feel like giving up.

If you give your best, then you have the highest chance of getting rewarded, but if you do not, then it is just work and nothing else. Don't be bored when you use your energy at work, just be happy and celebrate it just as well as you should.

**2. the best way to train people**.

Training other people can be very effective in helping you learn more about yourself and gain more perspective and ideas. When you do this, you gain a lot of insight and knowledge and will be able to provide more training to others.

In case you don't find people, try online coaching and improve lives. There are many social media to connect with people and give them help. You can also create your own page, so you can find people who need it and help them. This is the best thing you can do to improve your life.

***3.*** **Failure is a lesson*****.***

Every person has failed in their lives, but that does not mean that we are failures if we keep trying like my mentor said don't stop and keep going since success takes time and failure is your learning, so don't be afraid of mistakes. Every mistake you make is your revenue.

When you fail, you learn many things about yourself. What you did was a mistake, and you learn so much and that will build your strength to end up more powerful, and in that period of time, you train your mind to accept failure. We will inevitably fail in our life, but how we cope with it will affect how we move forward.

**4. Performance**

When we watch a great performance, our behavior changes. For example, when you attend a comedy show, your behavior changes more than before. When you attend an event, your behavior changes automatically as a result of a great performance.

It impacts your behavior, like if you are in the gym you become more confident, feel good, and more powerful. When you lose weight you become more aggressive, sweat more, build self-esteem, and become more confident. That is how your behavior changes based on where you go.

You should find a good opportunity to change your behavior and learn more about the world and yourself, and to learn more about yourself. It's great for you.

***5. Comparison Is The Thief of All Joy.***

Many people are comparing their own journey to other people's, and likewise, I am evaluating my own journey, so just look at it from my perspective, and you'll see we each have a unique journey, a different background or circumstance, and a unique state of life, so just use your perspective.

You should compare yourself to yourself not others, and focus on how you see yourself after five years and now today and if you want to change, you will need to change yourself. You won't be able to change others if you don't change yourself.”

**6. Improve your strengths**.

Find what you love most about your career and increase your strength in the workplace. No one is an expert at first, it takes a lot of time, but if you believe in hard work, you can make it and go places you wanted to go. Find what you love most about your career that's your passion that you enjoy and work hard.

When you work on it, things will work for you, you will see the difference in your personality and more knowledge; your relationship with other people will improve, and you will begin to change yourself; you will build your mindset, and many more things will change for you.",1644400901.0
Stop trying to be perfect,31,snv6k0,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snv6k0/stop_trying_to_be_perfect/,6,"Stop trying to be someone you aren’t. Stop holding yourself to such high expectations. You are not a robot. You have emotions, you have interests, you are always changing, and you will make mistakes. That’s what makes you human.

People don’t love you for your effectiveness. People don’t love you for all those things you have achieved or how skillful you are. People love you because you are YOU. Imperfections are beautiful. Mistakes are beautiful. They are nothing to be ashamed about. 

There has been an epidemic of self help and a system designed to tell us that we are not enough as we are. The system tells us that only when we become “somebody” we are worthy of respect. It tells us that only when we get that dream job, only when we buy that big house, only when we have everything we think we want, we will finally be enough. That isn’t true. You are already enough. You aren’t your achievements. Achievements are only a small part of life, and they don’t decide your worth. 

This isn’t to say that you aren’t allowed to grow or accomplish anything. This post is meant to put things in perspective and reveal that we spend so much time trying to “become” this ideal version of ourselves and improve our lives that we neglect what is happening NOW in the present moment. We withhold satisfaction from ourselves and say  “not until I accomplish this.” We reject ourselves and who we are until we think we are good enough. But this is a never ending cycle, and you will only want more and more.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644379589.0

Advice to 20 something’s from a 20 something: Get a goal,27,snkjy2,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snkjy2/advice_to_20_somethings_from_a_20_something_get_a/,5,"I’ve noticed a trend in my young adult peers: everyone feels directionless and lost, no one’s knows what to do, and have no future goals.


So I feel obliged to give some advice and hope that it helps at least somebody. 

Over the past three years I’ve read a shit ton of self help, psychology, philosophical and business books and I’ve found a common trend.

You need a goal. 

Humans are goal strivers, I mean, you’ve gone your whole life with the goal of getting an education and then a job.

Now you’re out of the education system either with a job or looking for one, but there’s a problem: you don’t have goals.

You don’t have something that gives you a reason to work hard.

Think about it, what did you do when you had the goal of making it to graduation?

You got up early. You put in the hard work. You engaged in deep work while studying. You looked towards the future.

And you did all of that because of one thing: a goal.

If you feel lost it’s because you don’t have a goal that fills your life with meaning.

So what do you need to do? Find your worthwhile goal. And suddenly, you won’t feel lost anymore.

Of course finding your goal takes some deep introspection. But hey, at least your new goal can be finding a suitable goal, aye?

I hope this helps someone, and if you want to talk more about this or pick my brain you can either comment or hit my inbox.

I’ve well versed in habit change, deep work and flow, the science of happiness: PERMA, productivity, etc. 

TLDR: You need a goal to have some sense of meaning in life

EDIT: Read the comment down below! I missed a vital step which is: change your thinking which then ALLOWS you to find your goal.",1644327767.0

I am a complete mess and am desperate to turn my life around,4,snyi3n,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snyi3n/i_am_a_complete_mess_and_am_desperate_to_turn_my/,2,"[21M] There are days where I’m very productive and decide to turn my life around. A week ago I spent 3 hours cleaning out my very messy room, and I studied/ate healthy. I was actively job hunting and going to bed early. I was exercising daily and getting in shape. 

However, there is another side of me that takes over and completely ruins my clean streak. I’ll binge on every possible junk food I can find. I’ll spend 12 hours in bed on my phone or playing video games. I’ll watch so much porn and masturbate 8 times in a day. I’ll somehow make my room into a bigger mess than it was before. 

I’ll only snap out of it once I realize I’ve been fucking around too much and have an approaching deadline for school coming up. I’ll go into damage control trying to salvage all of the lost time I wasted by cramming at the last minute. Despite having a horrible work ethic, I’ve somehow managed to get straight A’s, with constant praise from my professors and classmates. 

They think I’m smart and hard-working, but the truth is that I’m a gluttonous slob with no self-control. I’m not even smart in the slightest, I just know how to crunch when the clock is ticking. I have no actual skills or a portfolio that I can use for my future career prospects, because I’ve wasted my whole life just excessively consuming media and doing absolutely nothing. 

I even fail to take care of very basic tasks:

1. I don’t care to do anything at all unless I absolutely have to. I once spent 2 days starving with no groceries because I was too lazy to get up and go to the store. When I got home from school for winter break though, I ate everything in my parents’ refrigerator until my stomach couldn’t handle it anymore. 

2. I used to never shower or change my underwear for days because I didn’t see the reason to. I was basking in my filth so much I got a UTI. It took my dumbass 19 years to realize that I smelled horrible if I didn’t shower within 24 hours. I’m still very lazy though and can only get myself to shower every 36-48 hours.  

3. Last year, I was diagnosed with a chronic disease that I have to manage with medication for the rest of my life. If I don’t, my condition will become much worse over time. One day I ran out of meds and I didn’t feel like calling my doctor to approve my prescription to be refilled, so I just kind of forgot about it for a year. For the last two weeks I’ve been constantly shitting pools of blood into my toilet every time I go to the bathroom and have felt sick overall. It took a huge health scare to finally motivate me to set up a Zoom appointment with my doctor for next month. 

I told myself I was going to find a job this semester since I only have 2 days of class a week. I even got a job offer with good hours for something pretty easy, but I turned it down because the commute was an hour away. However, the truth is that I’ve been very lazy and don’t want to get out of bed. I honestly hate job hunting and can’t spend more than an hour on it once a month. 

Last week, my professor said that he was impressed by my projects last semester and recommended to my counselor that I should work on an independent project with him. He wants to help me get my foot through the door by helping me score an internship, but the problem is that I lack every qualification the internships require. I never learned how to use the programs I’m supposed to know, and I haven’t even emailed him back what my idea of an independent project is a week after talking. 

The harsh truth is that I only do my homework because I’m scared to get yelled at by my teachers. I don’t have any actual passion for anything. All of my hobbies or interests are only done to impress people and get validation from others around me on a surface level. Once I graduate from school, I’ll come out having absolutely no idea what I learned or what I’m going to do with my life after slacking off this much. I don’t really care about my future much or what happens to me. Frankly, if I were to die tomorrow, I don’t think I’d be too concerned because I don’t know if I have much to live for. 

There’s so much more I would like to say but this is already too long of a post. I have so many regrets in life and I wish I was more responsible with my life and had the drive to take initiative.",1644363703.0

I’m not sure where to ask for advice because I don’t know if I need a life coach, therapist, work coach, careers adviser, counsellor or mentor. I think a mentor would be great but I don’t really know how to find one and I don’t have many friends so I don’t really have many people to talk to.

I think it was not long before Christmas that I found out about Barbara Sher (RIP) and her TED talk which really spoke to me because it explains that isolation is a big barrier to achieving your dreams. I liked the sound of her success teams but there isn’t a group near me and I heard about one over the phone but it was too expensive and I think it costs a lot to train to be a coach. I’ve bought the books called ‘Wishcraft’ and ‘Refuse to Choose’ but haven’t got round to reading them yet. 

What do you think?

sometimes doing what is best for you is hard at first but in the end it makes things easier,14,snk9nr,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snk9nr/sometimes_doing_what_is_best_for_you_is_hard_at/,1,"I quit my full time job. I gave them two months so I can fully train their new hires and because of my role with the organization. I respect the work they do but it was no longer aligned with me and the culture can be toxic at times due to other employees that are essentially miserable and the workload is intense due to a very small staff. 

I have one month left and right now I'm training two people at once, and about to hire a third. Definitely being reminded that needing to hire three people to help fill my gap proves how much I do there and how I was underpaid for all of my roles and value. 

I am exhausted. Each day it's a struggle for me to get up because of sheer tiredness and not being in the mood to be shadowed by people asking questions constantly. I was just reflecting on how much ""easier"" my days would be if I had just decided to stay and go along doing my status quo. 

But this image I have of how much easier it would be is an illusion. It would have been easier short term, but the cost of working at a job that does not fit who I am or where I want to be going is extremely high. I feel like we're often so focused on our short term and easing uncomfortability now that we forget how much better our life would be if we leaned into the uncomfortability sooner. 

There's so many times I've decided to go back to yoga, or start up running again and the short term sucks. I feel sore, out of breath, out of shape, it's uncomfortable for sure. But two weeks in, my body feels different, I feel different. I'm less uncomfortable in it. I'm able to move with more ease and grace. The same thing goes for eating healthy instead of take out. Yeah, the short term is annoying. But get past the initial hump and you are quickly reminded of why you are doing what you are doing. The same thing goes for healing. Comfronting parts of my painful past is not necessarily something I want to do, and it's super uncomfortable, but doing so leads to me reacting less to my triggers, feeling more at home in my body, and being able to connect deeper to myself and others, which is a type of comfortability I never had before I started the active healing/self-improvement journey. 

I always connect back to my why whenever I get lost in the day to day stuff that feels really hard in the moment. Why am I doing this? Well, because it's what's best for me and I want to take action that is good for me. There used to be a time where I took sabotaging actions because I hated myself and would do every extreme action to make sure my body changed so I could ""love myself"". But the truth is we have to love ourselves first in order for lasting change, and often times uncomfortable action is needed at first. 

But just because we're uncomfortable doesn't mean we have to be miserable. Especially if you keep connecting back to why you are doing what you are doing, and it is leading you to be the kind of person, living the kind of life you envision for yourself. 

And not so long down the road, you'll find yourself living with more ease in ways you never thought possible.",1644326960.0

I don't feel loved,3,snrvpi,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snrvpi/i_dont_feel_loved/,5,"Hiya peeps!

Skip the following paragrapph if you don't want to know how my life looks rn.

In total I'd say I live a pretty happy life right now. I am a 20 year old university student (in germany) in my 5th semester now. I study something I am very passionate about. Outside of studying I too follow my passion and am very happy while doing it. I have a clear goal in my head where I want to go and how I'm going to do it. My parents fund me and I don't have to work to keep my head above water. I still work a part time job just for the extra money. In my free time I have 3 amazing roommates and a friend that puts a smile on my face everytime I see her no matter how shitty the day was. We cuddle basically all the time and would say we are VERY close. I train cheerleading (all stars kind) 2 times a week and acrobatics 1 time a week, also with my friend. There I see many people I like but am not particulary friends with. The sport is really fun and I enjoy every second of it.

So yes. My life is actually pretty great right? Still, something is bugging me. I haven't had a girlfriend in all of my 20 years of life. Now, this is itself isn't really a problem right? Well, to me it is. Not in a way where I feel preassured to have one, but just me WANTING one. So the past years I've had this yearning. Now yesterday, I thought to myself: ""Why do I even want a girlfriend? What would she add to my life that I don't have already? Why do I feel this yearning?"". Sexual frustration is definitely a part of it, but I don't feel like this is the deciding factor.The answer came to me in a flash. I want to feel loved. I don't feel loved and I feel like a gf would change that. After that realization I cried myself out for some time and went to sleep. So yeah first step in the right direction I'd say?

So now the next questions comes up. Why don't I feel loved and how do I feel loved? Well I've done some research, and everything I found was ""you should love yourself"". Well here's the thing. I wouldn't say I love myself, but I definitely LIKE myself. I like the way I am and am quite confident. I know my weaknesses and the things I still have to learn, the flaws within me and I am constantly working to improve myself. But we are all human beans and noone is perfect, right? :) Anything else would be boring anyways. To me, it is completely otherworldly to ""love"" yourself. Are you supposed to adore yourself? Put on pink glasses and be Narcissus? I don't know how I could make a step further from my current self liking in a reasonable way.

If you've read this far, I thank you very much to hearing me out and reading my thoughts. I feel like I have to get this out there and see, maybe someone of you has some clarifications of something I maybe don't understand right? Or some tips in general?

Thanks you for reading.

This move required me to break my nearly 6 year relationship and engagement to move in with my closest friend of over a decade. I wanted a new adventure, the mountains, etc. all of it. I could barely wait any longer I was so excited and slowly started shedding some of my commitments in anticipation of the move...

Fast forward, its now February and I decided to come out here for a week to get everything I needed for myself and my dog to settle into our new life in the spring... and suddenly I am overwhelmed with regret.

I made this decision in the peak of a depressive episode and worry that I only did so as a means of seeking a dopamine hit. The prospect of starting over sounded so new and exciting in a place more aligned with my ideal lifestyle. I worry that if I actually move here leaving my life, career, family, and most of my friends behind I will find myself feeling even more depressed than I did then...

 I cannot stop thinking about my relationship (which I am still in until I move) and how much guilt I feel for leaving him and our life together behind. I worry if I stay in my hometown I will be filled with regret and what if... but I also worry if I leave I will face the same.

Practical mindfulness,2,snpbz8,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snpbz8/practical_mindfulness/,1,"Hey everyone,

I'm sure I'm not alone in understanding and valuing the idea of mindfulness for its own sake. Mindfulness and meditation have been in my life (on and off, admittedly) for years, but eventually I realized that the only real benefit I was getting was feeling calm and centered for a short period of time after the meditation. 

I fully understand the logic of deferred gratification and return, and that many health benefits would likely come with making meditation a routine part of my life, but I've never had any real interest in developing a meditation habit or deepening my practice.

That being said, I've been focusing a lot lately on the idea of ""checking in"" with myself. Not meditating, but simply reminding myself to be present for even a split second so I can jump out of my auto-pilot mode and evaluate what I'm doing and how it's serving me.

I've realized that *any* goal I have or area of my life I want to change, I need to bring mindfulness into it. I need to check-in with myself along the way to make sure I'm bringing energy to my goals, that I'm chasing an outcome for the right reasons, and that I'm listening to my body and intuition so that I can pivot as required.

What started out as a journal entry to develop my own ""checking-in"" system has turned into something that I really would love to share.

If the idea of using mindfulness in a highly practical way to improve your life is something that you're interested in, let me know! I'm currently developing an e-book that I'll be sharing for free, but I'd like a small group of interested people to bounce ideas off of along the way.

I'm thinking I'd like to send newsletter length sketches of the various steps, from why checking-in is important, how to make it a habit, how it can help you, and everything in between. Feedback would be highly encouraged.

"I want to have patience around my father, and ""keep my cool"" around him.",3,snlpdh,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snlpdh/i_want_to_have_patience_around_my_father_and_keep/,0,"Context:I've been studying and living abroad for the past 8 years. I broke up with my ex 3 months ago, and have been living back at my parents' place since then, for multiple reasons (therapy in my mother tongue, no rent to pay while I get my life back on track, and just family as the safety net).I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. I live in a very supportive Italian household, I'm not here because I'm told I should be, or emotionally coerced into it. I make enough to find a room/small apartment and move out, I'm just convinced that *for now* (might change in a week) it's best I'm here.

My father's way of showing affection, his love language if you will, is acts of service, and stressing about everything that could go wrong. He is the absolute nexus of all the anxiety this household experiences.There is a *huge* difference between, say, having lunch with my mother, and having lunch with my mother *and* my father. When I noticed that the other day, I burst out crying mid-meal in front of my mother.He'll buy our favourite food, drive us where we need to go, will cook for everyone, and take care of bureaucratic matters my mother isn't willing to handle. He's just going to do it mumbling and complaining.He'll hardly ever show affection in a conventional way, like hugging my sister, *showing more affection to his wife*, or a hand on my shoulder, or a ""good job"" when my sister scores high on her exams.This man has been a major topic in my therapy sessions.To use my therapist's words so this post feels a bit less like I'm venting, *he has held firmly onto the status of son* (there's an unhealthy affection between him and his mother) *and hasn't worked at all towards the status of father.*

I don't like him.With a few asterisks, but you could say I hate him.

With unconditional love from his mother, he's grown spoiled and self important. Working (like it's something only he does) is a great chance for him to complain. You could say the idea he has of himself, as the all-providing Father in the family is generational, but it's an issue nonetheless.Pointing out this ball of negativity around him is met with playing the victim, literally every time. It has worked wonders for him as a child, and he had the luxury to never have to change that trait.It makes sharing opinions and even having a casual conversation exhausting, because he'll twist disagreeing with him into a personal attack, and when you want to call him out on that, he'll say you're blowing it all out of proportion.

That, alongside his lack of tact and underlying sexist traits (if there's something to take care of around the house, he'll ask my sister first, and often last) makes for a toxic combination I just don't want to have around.My mother stands defeated, she has been for a couple decades, because you can't fight a man that's not even willing to acknowledge the problem exists.

My therapist says his behaviour is obsessive and controlling, and one of the options is fighting it.She also said I'm not the *cause* of his behaviour, but I might have to take *responsibility* for it, since he won't.I've fought him all my life, I still do, I've had less valid reasons as a teenager...Now I just want him to be a better father. I'm getting to the point where I'm not sure he can be.

I'd lie if I said this post doesn't have a bit of venting in it.Still, I ask for opinions on what would be a good way to make my patience last a bit more than 2 minutes. I hate the man but he's still my father. Communication isn't an option, so I want to try other ways before flipping him off completely.

Another significant (selfish) reason why I want to somehow force myself to be more forgiving towards him, is that by doing that with him, I can forgive myself, when I eventually start seeing some of his personality in me.I believe my experience abroad has made me a very different man than I would have been if I studied art in Italy, but genes are genes, I'll have some of him popping right back up throughout my life whether he's in a 100m range of me or not.  


One last reason is my sister's mental health. I can be belligerent around him, and while I communicate how I feel to him through the anger, my sister sees these confrontations as ""my family is fucked up"". I don't want to do that around her if there's no legitimate reason to.

All of my peers have respectable jobs, apartments, partners etc. I still live with a parent (where I honestly don’t see an issue but for me feels like I could do better). 

Over the past few years I have struggled with a debilitating existential crisis and severe mental health issues relating to identity, insecurities, depression, anxiety, etc. My anxiety has been doing a lot better but I feel it is because I’ve accepted this is who I am and I stopped caring, hence no anxiety. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, more like depression has melted into my bones + soul and have made their place forever. Numb.

Everyday is a reminder that I had my chance in highschool to change the course of my life forever and my father always told me every single day. “You are going to regret this, you are running out of time.” 
I graduated HS about 7 years ago and have absolutely nothing to show for it. Zero accolades. ZERO ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the slightest bit. 

I definitely have passions, like any other person. But I do not know “WHO I AM” To me, “WHO I AM” is not good enough, not worthy, worthless, lowly and uneducated. I came from a town where college was planted at the end of the tunnel or you were “one of those kids”. I am well aware of that toxic environment because everyone is different. 
I am aware people have different paths, dreams, aspirations and different kinds of ambition. Everyone is equal. As you can see it is a mental battle. 

To wrap things up… I don’t know where I am going. I feel hopeless but can’t cry any more tears because I am dead inside. I am not even on a path. I am in the dark with no direction, no goals, no light. I feel stuck. Time is ticking. I’ll be 30 in 4 years and I cannot even write that out calmly. I am losing my mind. 

All I am looking for is advice on anyone who has felt this way at this age or close to it. Preferably people older than 25, the older the better. All comments are appreciated. Thank you in advance to anyone that takes the time to read this.",1644243843.0

[Advice] How to maintain work-life balance,2,snmtb0,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snmtb0/advice_how_to_maintain_worklife_balance/,0,"In the times you are supposed to rest and relax, you think you are not doing enough for your business. When the work time comes... you feel exhausted.

Most of the time, we don't like the things restricting us, we don't like rules, routines. No no, it's not for us. We like freedom and flexibility. ""9 am-5 pm job"". What a boring phrase right? We think rules and routines kill our creativity. Our time is scheduled and there is no space to breathe. So our freedom is stolen and we don't accept that.

We like flexibility, but it might ruin our lives actually. We might end up with a big loss while feeling ""free"". Flexibility is very open to abuse. It can be a source of distraction if we are not careful.

Especially if you are working in a startup, our lives become work. We don't have a sense of weekend or holiday mostly. There are goals and targets so we just can't stop. But is it a really good thing to work on the weekend?

I think, not.

Let me explain how did it go with me, hope it resonates on your end as well. When I don't separate weekends from weekdays. It gives me a good sense of I am fully dedicated to my work, my plans and goals, etc. But I often get burned out and become aggressive to my team. I lose my willpower and I go to my office room with low energy.

I don't know if you ever come to that state of mind. But if you just insist on this situation and try to push more. What happens is you feel the responsibility and pain about time, plans and tasks to be done, but you just can't do anything. Your body and brain just can't take more. So you understand it's time to rest. These kinds of ups and downs are bad for your mental and body health.

But what to do?

Develop routines that will give you a sense of satisfaction that you've done enough. When your brain says; ""No! I need to work more"". Remember that you're stealing from the next work session by not resting this time.

Routines are not boring, they are life-saving habits. You need to build routines that involve rest and work. Routines create a kind of inner discipline that you respect your work time and rest time. If you've done your routines. You will know you've done enough for today and deserved some rest without any demons in your mind.

When it's work time, you will remember this is a limited time. You know you can't use the whole day or week to finish your job. So it creates a kind of ""FOMO"" to get things done.

Your brain develops more focus and you get things done as much as possible.

I suggest using the following rules while developing your routines.

**Timeboxing;**

It's all about putting a separator between time for entertainment and work. You can design your day as 45 min work and 10 min short breaks and you repeat this 5-6 times a day. Then you are good to go for entertainment stuff.

Does it really work? Is that simple?

I know it's not that easy. Our brains are lazy, when it sees a difficult task it likes to postpone it to 5 min later, 10 min later, or just a later time in the day. Frequently you see that task is postponed to tomorrow. When our brain decides to postpone, it finds a place to escape. This place is mostly an online newspaper or Twitter, Instagram, etc.

I call these moments ""escape moments"". Time-boxing makes sure you blocked those websites or apps for a specific time period. So you crash your ass and do the work.

So basically you promise yourself that you will focus on the next 45 minutes for that specific job and you will not run away. If you can't avoid escape moments I recommend using some browser extensions that will block websites and apps. Also, remind yourself that the only way to reach your goals is to get the work done in front of you.

**Singularity;**

I recommend that stay in one context for a timebox. I don't mean it should be one task but if you are coding just collect tasks that involve coding in the same timebox. If you need to write emails, you can just collect them in another timebox.

Context switching is costly for our brain. Each work context has its own variables. So boot loading our brain with new variables frequently will end up with low-quality work. For ins. if you are making a side project. Just keep side project stuff in different timeboxes than your full-time job. If you are creating content and writing code, put them in separate timeboxes.

I hope my post creates awareness about developing focus, avoiding distractions, and keeping the work-life balance.",1644333927.0

“why should i want to live if life has suffering? Sure it’s necessary for happiness but does that make it worth it? If I’m dead I won’t have to be happy and I won’t have to suffer?

I never thought this way until i heard the idea from others on the internet. I hate it. I have a good life, but does it make sense?

"I’m being spoiled, abused, have depression and ADHD. Also, I’m lazy and I need help",4,snh7zn,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snh7zn/im_being_spoiled_abused_have_depression_and_adhd/,5,"My mother has always been abused both physically and mentally by my father. This is why we both moved out, I was a baby so I don’t remember much. She originally moved to another place but my father begged her to stay and promised her he would help her financially so she decided to come back to the place where my father lives. She got custody of me, won in court because she said some “Doesn’t matter how rich you are if you aren’t loved” bullshit and thus I live with her still. She has always been abusive with me, yes, both physically and verbally, just like my father was with her. She would hit me, push me against the wall, pluck my hair, throw various things at me, call me many things and so on. When I was around 11 or so, I confessed I think I have depression and she said to just think positively. When I attempted suicide, she beat me, never asked why I did it and if I’m okay. She hasn’t hit me until recently and she kept justifying how she didn’t hit me that hard. After I told her that the only thing she’s good at in life is hitting me, she kept focusing on that and got offended by it. I don’t understand how one can be so blind and compare me saying that over her hitting me. Moving on. Her mother, she would say things like “All mothers love their children, no matter what they do, they do it for their children”, “She didn’t hit you that hard, she didn’t even abuse you”, “Older people know better than you do”. When I tried to kill myself, she said how I deserve to get beaten up to learn a lesson. Now my father is another story, he is 100% a sociopath. He told my half-brother how he wished his mother never gave birth to him. When my other half-brother died, which he also complained about to me, he was faking sadness, when my brother was in so much pain when he was alive and my father never cared. I don’t know if he ever hit me, but he always gaslights, manipulates, lies, is being fake, makes me feel terrible for anything I do. Every time I fail, I’m the one to blame, no matter how much I try. He is a man on a stage, pretending he is the main character. He’s also filthy rich, so even if I tried to report him for abuse, nothing could be done. My mother tried, no one helped her. His boys were getting hit by his girlfriends and he didn’t do anything about it. 

So my problem is now, I have shitty parents, yeah? But the thing is, my mother always did everything around the house. She never tried to teach me anything and even when I ask for advice, she laughs at me for not knowing some things “everyone knows”. I want to learn, I want to work, I really do. But there’s so much I don’t know. I hate it when people say how mothers who spoiled their kids care for them. It’s not true. It’s harder to teach someone how to do something rather than just doing it on your own and giving the ending results. Thinks about it like homework. You ask your friend for help, instead of explaining it to you, they give you the answer to the question and you are still confused as to what the hell you just did. When your professor asks you how you managed to do your homework, you don’t know!

My father didn’t want to pay my high school loan so I’m practically left with only middle school. He can pay, he’s very rich, he just doesn’t want to. He says it’s the principle’s fault for not giving me a diploma, but I know I wouldn’t give someone who owes me 1300 dollars a diploma. 

My biggest issue in all this is I plan to move out next year and live with my boyfriend. I need to save money if I want to make our lives better. I want to learn to be independent, more than anything. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t even be here, he is my hope, the reason I’m still fighting.
How do I become independent? How do I avoid getting hurt even though my parents make me feel awful? I’m soon 20 but being spoiled has destroyed any possibility of me living alone now, though I am looking for a job as I write this. I want to believe there is still hope, even though I may not feel like it right now.
If you’ve read this far, thank you so much. I really need someone right now.",1644316686.0

Find your daily footholds (part 1),1,snq7zg,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snq7zg/find_your_daily_footholds_part_1/,0,"*Each of us is different and is set to find his own unique calling.*

Daily footholds are rituals we develop as part of our essential self and acknowledge that we will do them for the rest of our life. It is easy to be lost in this word of constant noise and streams of different information. The chaotic life may throw us from one shore to another. It is easy to tumble around for days, months, even for years till we find something we can cling upon. But, alas, this may not last long, as the chaotic winds of life may sway as again, and we will continue to tumble. That is way it is so important to develop and cling upon your own daily footholds, which will help to return to the track no matter how strong the winds that may sway you are. They will keep you at bay no matter the tragedies that may influence your life.

Daily footholds are the first step in developing and finding our ideal day of expression and fulfillment. They will renew the day from the same familiar blank page. The winds of noise that swayed you the day before will not matter in this case. You will start the day anew. From the same page.

There are rules in finding the ideal daily footholds.

First of all, **they must be done first thing in the morning**. You want to start each your days the same way. This will help to begin from the blank page. You may think this will be cumbersome and unimaginative, but the rest of the day is still set in front of you and there will be time and place in each day to experiment and be wild.

Second, **the morning footholds must be easy to do and not demand mental strain**. Remember you are going to do those rituals every day for the rest of your life or at least the considerable portion of it. And those will be actions that you can rely upon. If you choose something difficult from the get go, say you intend to do some pushups every morning or some elaborate morning exercise, soon you may lose interest, as those demand physical or mental strain. The idea is not to develop strength, it is to develop discipline.

Thirdly, **they must not be rushed and take some time to do**. The footholds are rituals, and rituals must not be rushed. Some time must be allowed to reset the inner clock, to mentally rejuvenate for the chaotic day to come. Then again, when something is rushed it is done with some resistance, and when the resistance is accumulated, you will not be willing to do the task again.

Fourthly, **they must be done in the absence of destruction**. You must not invite the outside world to participate in your morning rituals. If you think listening to music, news or podcasts is a good idea when doing these morning rituals, then rethink. Those things are the product of outside world, which by chance may one morning bring news or an outbreak of a new trend that may sway you away. These may hinder the efforts to reset the day. The outside world could wait, those activities will have time and place throughout the day to enjoy and consume. You may listen to familiar and calm music though, as the sound of familiarity is one thing you can cling upon.

Fifthly, **the morning footholds should be adaptive to be carried out regardless of the place and circumstance**. The chaotic life may throw you to different shores. You might turn out to be in different places and circumstances. Thus, our morning footholds must be such that everything we need to perform them should always be at hand and easy to carry.

*I will post the second part that gives examples of daily footholds same time tomorrow.*

One example, is sports and games, video games, card games, board games etc.  I enjoy playing them, but I am bad at every game I've ever played and can never ever beat others.  The only time I can beat anyone is if its a complete beginner ( and in that case, they generally over take me as soon as they have practised for a few days) and little kids (and even then I'm meant to let them win).  Older kids beat me at everything (I am early 30s) and so does everyone else.

""But practise makes perfect"", nope, not for me.  All practise does for me is take me from being embarrassingly dreadful, to a little bit bad.  It never takes me from the little bit bad point.

"I lost my job today, and idk what do.",3,sng5mf,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sng5mf/i_lost_my_job_today_and_idk_what_do/,4,"I (28f) wasn't fired, but tonight I was notified I have 3 weeks to find a new job, which is highly stressful and disappointing. I recently moved, I have rent and other bills piling up. So, I needed my job.

**About my job**

I was a contractor for 9 going on 10 months. Initially, my coworkers and I were told we'd transition to a permanent role last month. However, we had to re-apply and interview for our positions instead, but our boss ensured us it was only a formality.  However, only 3/8 of us were hired. There were 10 jobs avalible. I believe 5 of my coworkers would've been hired, but I know 2 had other obligations. I'm unsure why that didn't include me because I was just as hardworking if not more at times. My recruiter is also confused. She's the one who notified each of us.

 In my boss's defense, he did encourage some of us to apply for other positions at the company, including another contractor role, while we waited to hear back. However, we assumed it was a formality too so none of us did, and the role is closed now.  Again, I'm unsure why he wouldn't prefer me on his team. 

I was unhappy at the job. It's completely outside of my career field.  My boss ignored me at times. He also underestimated me while overestimating others. He always assigned me with 2 of my coworkers that never did their assigned work leaving me to pick up their slack. My assumption is he wasn't sure who was/wasn't working because the system we use doesn't track our individual productivity. **However, I never expressed any of this outwardly. I was remote. The pay was good, flexible hours, and I needed the money. I showed my boss I wanted the job (time, diligence, effort, etc.)**

**My Career Goal**

My goal to find an entry-level in Graphics Design by July. I gave myself 5 months because I need to create a new design portfolio from scratch. My portfolio from college is subpar and outdated. I'd hate to take another temp position or job outside of the creative world because it moves me further and further from starting a career. 3 weeks isn't much time to create a solid portfolio and land a job. 

**IDK now**

I feel pretty lost, sad, not good enough, and screwed over. I cried a lot tonight and last night (frustrated with my job/finances/life).  I at least wanted/needed this job until I could find something new. *Maybe, this is the pressure I need to get things done*, or maybe it's unfortunate.  I may have to accept another role outside of my career goals/field with lower pay. 

Things could work out for the best, but it would require swift and strategic action. However, I don't even know what to apply for at this point. I have a degree. I  can code, design, edit content, and write, but I have no portfolio or experience outside of college. I can't afford another year working dead-end jobs.

**Any words of encouragement or advice on how to get through this and reach my goals would be helpful. Could I reach my goal in 3 weeks?**",1644312404.0

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644294008.0

I am planning on moving to Florida for a little to get certain licenses for a job that I would like them traveling to another country to save while making US currency.

Leaving your phone outside your bedroom before going to sleep,1,snlxvm,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/snlxvm/leaving_your_phone_outside_your_bedroom_before/,1,"How good of an idea is it to leave your cellphone outside your bedroom before you go to bed? 

I heard this as a life-pro-tip many years ago, but I've never implemented it mainly because I use my cellphone as my alarm clock (an issue that could be easily solved by purchasing an actual alarm clock), and because in case someone calls me in the middle of the night for any emergency or whatever reason (which has never happened) I wouldn't be able to hear the phone.  

I think it's a pretty sound advice because very often I wake up and the first thing I do is pick up my phone for about an hour before actually getting out of bed, and I figured I could really use that extra time in more productive activities by leaving the phone out of reach. 

It's also apparently a healthier approach because some experts don't recommend you sleep next to your phone because of the amount of radiation that it emits which can disrupt sleep, amongst other things. 

So, what do you think? Should I sacrifice that potential moment when someone might need me for some emergency reason in order to improve my sleep and use my time more efficiently?",1644331577.0

# Introduction

So Freaky Friday was a thing. Repeatedly. With such an invigorating and intellectually stimulating plot, the next remake is just a matter of time. My bets are on 2026. Anyway, imagine you switched bodies with someone you look up to, an idol of yours, someone that has achieved everything you dream of achieving yourself one day. They have it all. The money, the brain, the body, the fame. And out of nothing, within the blink of an eye, you inhabit their body, living their life. You have everything you ever wanted, just like that. It's weird at first, but you certainly don't mind. Fast forward a few years. Life is not exactly how you would have hoped. A lot of things went downhill, alarmingly fast. The money? At this point, you've lost pretty much everything. And with it, all of that status, fame, and the cognitive abilities of your shiny new brain. But hey, at least you gained one thing: a whole lot of body fat. Generally quite depressed, you catch yourself daydreaming a lot lately. If only you could be like that person they keep mentioning in the news. Apparently, they managed to build an empire out of nothing within just a few years, unbelievable! And they look somewhat familiar, almost like the old version of yourself, just healthier, more charismatic, and better in every way. Oh, how you envy them...

I bet everyone has heard the stories of lottery winners that have lost everything within just a couple of years. A rich person is more than just the number on their bank account. It's the sum of personality traits, skills, habits, and the network they create around themselves. The same thing is true for pretty much everything else in life that's worth achieving. A healthy, fit person wasn't just lucky. They spend a lot of time and effort on maintaining their body, using habits they have built over many years.

So instead of waiting for a Freaky Friday scenario to miraculously make all your dreams come true, how about you adopt the habits of this future version of yourself, the version that has everything figured out?

# Step 1: What do you want?

Sit down, with a pen and piece of paper (preferably multiple, especially if you're ambitious, and everyone likes to think of themselves as ambitious, right?). How do you want your life to look like roughly 5 years from now? Which job do you have? Where do you live? Do you own a house? How about your relationship? Are you married by then? How's your lifestyle? Any new skills you picked up? Any bad habits you finally got rid of? Dream up the perfect life for yourself, as vivid and detailed as possible. Try to cover all aspects. Use this list for inspiration:

* Health/Body
* Mental/Emotional
* Partner/Love
* Family
* Friends
* Mission
* Experiences
* Finances
* Learning

# Step 2: How will you be like?

To circumvent any limiting beliefs you might have, in the next step, you will stop associating yourself with this ideal future version you have constructed. From now on, this is some random person that just happens to perfectly align with your own aspirations. What are they like? What is special about their personality? Can you sketch out a typical day for this person? What do they do throughout this day? Which habits do they have? Also: which habits are absent? A successful real estate investor might do regular trips throughout their preferred neighborhoods to stay up to date on how certain parts of it are developing and serendipitously stumble across potential deals. A passionate teacher might spend Saturday afternoons volunteering for an organization that keeps local kids off the streets, not only to support them, but also to widen their perspective on what education actually is, and how important it is for the next generation.

# Step 3: Research habits of real-world examples

To help round out this person you are constructing in your mind, think of some real-world examples of people that are doing what you want to do in the next few years, or at least parts of it. Depending on how famous these types of people would be, you can either google their habits directly, go through some interviews, ask around on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, or maybe you even know some already and can just invite them for a coffee?

# Step 4: Assess your habits, and adopt new ones

At this point, you should have a list of habits, traits, and skills that are central to this person. Notice how we didn't focus on how they got to where they are, but just on what they do repeatedly. In most cases, simply adopting these habits will inevitably lead you down the correct path. Assess how well your current habits align. Which ones would be easiest to adapt and adopt, which ones would have the greatest impact? But don't overdo it, take baby steps and go for one habit at a time. If you're having problems when it comes to new habits and sticking to them long-term, I highly recommend ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. He summarized the most effective ways to integrate new habits into your daily routine.

All this talk of habits and Freaky Friday got me thinking: What if instead of bodies, Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis switched their daily routines and habits...? That's blockbuster material right there!!! Million-dollar idea! If you're secretly working on the 2026 remake of Freaky Friday, you better not steal that plot without at least giving me some credit!",1644344772.0

How to find who I am?,34,smrqkm,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smrqkm/how_to_find_who_i_am/,41,"I’m 33, but I feel like I have no idea who I am. I feel like I’ve always been led by others, caved to other peoples opinions and suggestions, and never really learned to form and -stick- to my own beliefs. I feel like I don’t even know what they are. 

I’ve looked online and a lot of exercises have questions to find yourself like ‘what could you talk endlessly for hours about?’ … ‘what do you most believe in?’ … ‘what values do you hold most close?’ … I draw blanks at all of them. 

I’m starting my journey to be my authentic self, not conform to other peoples expectations and adopt other peoples belief systems. I want to think for myself and act what’s best for me. 

Can anyone provide any resources, thoughts, advice for my situation? I literally feel lost, like I’m going through the motions of life and have no idea who I am… so of course I can’t act authentically if I don’t even know what my authentic self is!!

I read brene brown book ‘Braving the Wilderness’ which was insightful. And I’m starting to look into implementing boundaries for myself (My boundaries are highly lacking and I usually get taken advantage of. I don’t feel that my opinion matters, and I should always cater to others).

help! I want to improve who I am for myself and my relationship,2,sn7elr,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sn7elr/help_i_want_to_improve_who_i_am_for_myself_and_my/,0,"So currently I'm aware that I am an upset angry person  with myself more so than anything else or anyone but it obviously comes out on the person I love which I hate. (No physical violence or anything like that, just sarcastic or dismissive) I am trying to change and it feels like I am getting nowhere. 

Backstory: was sexually abused by a family member for 4 years when I was 8. Learnt to keep my emotions hidden which also encouraged social anxiety and depression and a hugely overactive thinker. Struggled emotionally throughout my life with random outbursts or breakdowns especially after having a drink. (Have since been to therapy and worked through that side of things. It was just letting my guard down and all the pent up emotions would get out and to everyone else was shock cause they can't see what goes on inside my head) 

More recently I moved half way around the world. Met a girl and fell in love. We travelled loads all over her country together. Pure bliss. When I finished up work at the end of 2020 I decided to stay in the country to give the relationship a go. It separated us distance wise for a while because of visa work but we both drove ,6 hours each way each weekend to be with eachother when we could and all the attention was on eachother. Every little detail mattered. 

Eventually there was a change in my visa status and I was no longer allowed work. We decided for me to move back and move in with eachother and apply for a relationship visa. I am currently on interim which means I am waiting for a response from immigration on what my future is. Till then I am not allowed to work or volunteer or anything. Basically just a stay at home person .. to some that sounds amazing but I am a very practical person and physical person so want to be out doing things and feeling like I can contribute to the house and purchases and everything but sadly I can't. Repeating the same jobs at the house every day is driving me mad and that frustration on visas and no money and repetitive meaningless tasks just constantly has me on edge. 

I have never liked myself as a human being. Not that I have been awful in any sense, in fact I have been quite caring for a lot of people from what I went through as a child. I just don't see myself as a good person overall. Been terrible with compliments gift receiving etc. 

I have since gone back to the gym training to get myself somewhat back on track but it's only covering a short amount of what is mostly all day spent on my own at the house. 

I just want to know where to start so o can be happier with myself which I know in turn will help me and my relationship with my partner grow more and more because I can see how taxing it is on her and I hate it. 

I can't afford or currently get counselling as it could hurt my visa chances and going out and about to meet friends for coffee isn't really an option as it's 2 people living on 1 income. So socialising becomes very difficult. 

If this feels written all over the place I do apologise just how my brain processes things and I struggle with trying to line it all up. 

Anyways any help or advice for goals to achieve or anything would be very much appreciated. Just done with getting nowhere",1644284398.0

If you lost the love of your life. If your life has no meaning.*

**How to get the most out of your life:**

Firstly. Secure your future by following your passion. Trust your gut we're only here once. Working mindlessly for someone else 9-5 for 40 years will eventually take its toll on you. Read books on your goals specifically by those who are living the life you wish to be living. Create something you believe in, leave your mark on the world. Develop relationships with like-minded people that have similar paths to yourself.

Secondly. You gotta hit the gym. Decide what you wanna be before you start lifting. Embrace proper dieting practices, eating healthy is half the battle. Don't be intimidated by others remain consistent with your routines while increasing your lifts each week and the results will soon follow along with a new sense of confidence. Persistence is key.

And finally, Real love. Don't be led astray by society's standards on dating and feeling guilty for missing out. Quality over quantity. Look for a real connection opposed to one which is based on your material values and what you can provide. Make sure your relationship energizes and supports you in your quest rather than derail and distract you from it. Find a teammate not a liability.

And that's it the only formula for success. **Take charge of your life today**. We only live once and we'ill die one day.",1644189955.0

I would like to drop some bad habits that I've picked during those 2 years, like being too dependant on people that give you attention, being more outgoing with randoms (Never had a problem doing small talks, its the action of going out to know new people that scares the shit out of me), stopping those cycles of anorexia/binge eating that I reckon I have problem with and the (sorta?) alcohol overuse.  
Also I would like to try to start to sing/rap, it's a thing that I love (the whole process of writing and hearing music) but dropped because I feel judged by others if I fail, what could I do to not feel the pressure?  
How can i take the leap of fate and start building my future? 

&#x200B;

Also for some background, I have a family that loves me, lot of friends that truly care about me, and no serious struggles in life that are pushing me away from my goals, but i'm still feeling stuck in a sort of vicious cycle that's keeping me away from my full potential.",1644276687.0
So much anxiety about something so many people can do...,1,sn90tv,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sn90tv/so_much_anxiety_about_something_so_many_people/,1,"I am extremely afraid of driving, so much so that I am 37, had my G1 (learner's permit)5 times, but never really moved past that. 

 I am so anxious behind the wheel that I feel as if I am being yelled at if anyone tried to give me direction...which sucks, because It makes me come across as such an intolerable person.  

 I really want to change this, i need to take the stress of driving off of my husband's shoulders and allow my daughter and i some freedoms that we don't have when my husband is working. 
 It needs to happen, but I just don't know how to get past the fear.
 
Country driving and highway driving are no problem at all! I can drive in all kinds of inclement weather, I can drive in the dark, I can drive for long periods of time.....but when I get into a city or large town, I am hyper focused. People are crazy! 
 I have been almost T-boned multiple times over the years by really bad drivers ( they blew through stop signs and just missed me on all occasions, usually looking at a cell phone).

What has helped me with SA,2,sn0vra,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sn0vra/what_has_helped_me_with_sa/,1,"I work a retail job in a store in a very touristy busy town. Im talking to people all day and obviously these conversations entail mostly small talk which is ok at times but when it’s all you do it is so emotionally draining as an empath with social anxiety as you all know. I do enjoy it sometimes and try to be as “real” as possible with my customers and can meet a lot of good people but on bad days and at points on good days the negative thoughts tell me I cant talk to anyone, and I start believing them and so I do have awkward encounters. 

I try to think of it as how funny and stupid it is that we, as a human spieces are so conscious of what another human is thinking about us.. And when we talk its like we are just making noises like other animals make- and those noises make us feel self-conscious and then we think about them afterwards…?

Anyways I want to share what has been working for me recently... I've realized that its all about establishing the self image. My belief about myself dictates how I interact with others. I am my own best friend and believe I am confident in many areas such as style, but when I start thinking insecure thoughts about myself like “Im not doing my job good enough,” “Im unapproachable and make people feel awkward,”  or ”I will never get past my struggles” I carry that self image around with me, putting out an inhibited personality and then seek validation in others during conversation (looking for signs that they like me.. ugh)… then replaying and dwelling on that awkward conversation.. The cycle continues

It helps me to focus on thinking about imagining myself succeeding and feeling comfortable, poised and confident. Truly imagining it and dwelling on how it would feel if it were real. and carry that around with me instead of replaying my past social “failures” in my head and dwelling on them.

The negative will cycle continue for me when all I think about is what I can do better or what I should have done or said. 

I think about the analogy of clearing a calculator before going on it to solve a new problem: You have to clear the machine of previous problems before typing in the new one, or else parts of the old problem will interfere with the new one and give you a wrong answer

Dont get me wrong, this habit takes a lot of brain training and sometimes I still find myself feeling tension and regret and shame socially. But I remember I can not carry it around all day. For me, feeling good in conversation is not feeling any pressure or forcing anything, authentically expressing myself. I know that I can be awkward sometimes, so what. I will focus on feeling good and being true to myself, so that I will fully become it externally.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

7- I should try to be more positive around people. I kinda focus on argumenting for no reason sometimes and that's not really healthy. So, I want to look back on my interactions and just try to be a little better next time.",1644209234.0

Backstory - I’ve been depressed for more than half my life (I’m almost 24). I’ve had a lot of issues with confidence, self doubt, anxiety etc. None of these have disappeared but I feel like I’ve gotten some control of it. I believe I’m still depressed but I’ve also managed to be able to function a lot more lately by distracting myself whether it’s productive or not. My mental health was very poor these past few years to the point where I’ve just locked myself away from the world and haven’t done much at all. 

Things have improved now, or at least I tell myself that. I’m investing, reduced my bad habits or gotten rid of them etc. I’m about to do a full time job but my confidence/doubt issues have come back. I’ve been away so long that I don’t think I can even do the job right - I’ve got a degree and my knowledge on things is quite broad so I know I can do whatever I need to do.

I'm an insanely negative person.

I genuinely don't understand how people can be positive, look at the bright side of life, etc. I'm trying to do that more often and it's a challenge. My mind just likes to go to the worst case scenario first.

I also have conversations about plenty of negative topics, and I'm worried it will drive people away. For example, I complain about lots of things, whether that be politics or the professor of a class I share with someone I'm talking to. I like to bring up downer topics, and I find it very hard to let go of the mindset that downer topics are better topics to talk about because they're so ""deep"".

I'm also interested in a lot of negative, sad and/or tragic stuff and I find myself drawn to it. My latest ""thing"" has been watching plane crash documentaries. I could probably tell you the details on at least 5 plane crashes with 50+ fatalities right now. I've loved anything related to disasters all my life, I think I was around 7 when my dad showed me and my brother clips from documentaries on the Challenger explosion on YouTube, and I've been hooked ever since. I like documentaries about serial killers, all kinds of disasters, etc. I like researching about diseases, the more deadly the disease, the better. When I was 9, I used to play veterinarian and made up fictional diseases for the animals. 

If I had to choose between 2 videos to watch, one titled ""best movies of 2021"" and one titled ""worst movies of 2021"", I would choose the latter, because I would have a ton of fun listening to that guy bash these movies. 

I think you get the idea.

So, how do I stop living in a cloud of negativity and deliberately exposing myself to it? How do I become like all those inspiring people who love life and care about a lot of positive, uplifting, interesting stuff like space exploration and the ocean clean-up project? How do I stop walking around thinking that the world is shit and it's better if an asteroid strikes the damn thing (that's a bit of an exaggeration, but a few years ago I would have probably agreed with that statement)? How do I start enjoying life and having a positive outlook? Is that even possible or are these people faking it?",1644182322.0
Accountability Partner wanted and offered,2,smudgb,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smudgb/accountability_partner_wanted_and_offered/,5,"Hello all, my life experience and reading leads me to understand that a big part of hitting goals is 

* Writing goals and plan of how achieve 
* Creating a completing vision of what look like when completed
* Getting motivated and taking the small actions to make it happen

* Having someone who holds you account to hitting these steps/commitments along the way.

Therefore I wondered if people wanted to partner up? We could set a DM/whatsapp to share current goals and the milestones need to hit. Then Weekly check in with each other to hold account.

The murky swamp [the constant self 8],1,smvfu3,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smvfu3/the_murky_swamp_the_constant_self_8/,0,"“I must attain and retain the cleanness of my space!” was being repeated over and over again.

The writing session started with slogans as mantras reputed in my brain while I was doing the ritual of cleaning, retaining myself and limiting myself from sitting down and commencing to write. This ritual resulted in usual overflowing eagerness and I was ready to start. Ready to put whatever was lingering in my brain to the paper.

Nonetheless my ideas and mind are hectic today. My mind jumps from one thing to another. And there is a fear floating deep inside that if I will not produce a worthy, cohesive text each day, I will stop. This is a thought that brings anxiety. I know myself, if I stop this may bring a succession of long unproductive and meaningless days, when I just convince myself that it is alright, that one must enjoy and be content. This is false. This does not bring long-term happiness. One must serve others to be content. If only happiness was the meaning of life, then most will surrender to their vices.

I am afraid of my laziness, of not being useful. And as a result, I am afraid of stopping due to not having good ideas in a sequence of a few days. That should not matter. If I dry up, then I must drug up my nose through the ground of murky ideas till I find my foothold. I will plough through the rocky grounds till my soil is fertile again.

When we commence our journey, we do not know and cannot predict what will lie ahead. Our journey may end up in a murky swamp of ideas, which we will either drown in or persevere; adjust and find our foothold, find a new ground till the land of ideas is dry to stand firmly upon.

A step in a murky swamp is still a progress. A sentence written with dried up creativity is still a progress. A nail driven in a board with weary arms is still a progress. Each step at a time, till we find our footholds and the second wind brings us home.

What is home? What is the difference between home and house? What makes a home? A house is a physical structure. Home is more philosophical. The idea of a home is not physical. Home is the place where the people we care about are. Home is the place where the ideas we care about are. Home is the place where the efforts we put in are. And in all these we give ourselves to it. Home is the place to which we give ourselves, to which we work for, to which we surrender.

So, when I write “the second wind will bring us home”. That means not to the place where we can relax, it means to the place where we can find the meaning. We must persevere through the murky swamps to find the meaning, and not to drown in oblivion.

And finally theres the life advice. Theres a lot that he says, and I fee like I should try and keep track of it all but obviously thats impossible, but trying to pick what to try now and what to try later is also tough.

Trying to balance all the Christian teachings with the life teachings and the high lever vocab and phrasing makes me feel like an idiot. I feel worse than I did before reading it...

How to unlock your social self?,5,smggf2,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smggf2/how_to_unlock_your_social_self/,2,"Hi, so right to the rip thank you for reading and any input is appreciated.

I have no idea how to talk to people. I grew up being bullied and having huge self esteem problems but I've worked on myself since and it's paid off physically but emotionally I don't know how to start.

I'm introverted by heart so I'm already shy by nature. It's hard for me to direct the conversation or try to talk to someone I don't know if I have to be the one to start the conversation. HOWEVER if someone approaches me and talks to me, I can go for hours with no problem. My best example is if I see someone I find attractive while I'm out and about, I would have no idea how to strike up a conversation out of the blue. Or even meeting people randomly. 9/10 I'm the guy that's posted up at a table alone at a public event because I don't know how to socialize in a group of strangers. It really sucks constantly feeling alone in a sea of people. Another easy example, I have over 1000 matches on tinder and I have not talked to anybody I've matched with mainly bc I have no idea what to say or how to start a conversation.

I'm 25 and I only have one friend that texts me everyday and that's not even to check in on how I'm doing. I'm used to being alone but I don't want to deal with it anymore if I know it's possible to change, I just don't know how to change and become more directly socialable.

TL;DR: idk how to socialize so it's hard for me to make new friends and meet new people. I feel stuck and alone, want to change but don't know how.

[Advice] How to get up after a period of slump,2,smgsqc,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smgsqc/advice_how_to_get_up_after_a_period_of_slump/,0,"Two months back I posted this on r/getdisciplined:

I got good advice and implemented that advice. The result was I had a good period of 2 months of productivity. But as invariably happens, I had to go out and was not able to follow my routine for some days and my period of slump started again. Today after almost 2 weeks into the slump I am deciding to get back up. I realized that since this keeps happening, again and again, I can write and form an approach to get back up faster each time. Here is an approach I came up with. It is a post from my journal. I would like to share it with others and if you feel there is something I can do differently or do better, feel free to add a comment. Here it goes:

I have this habit where I am very productive for a period. But the period invariably comes to an end sooner or later. I stop feeling like doing anything, I give up working on my goals, I start mindlessly scrolling LinkedIn, watching YouTube, and reading on Medium without actually doing anything to make progress towards my goals

I know I have this habit of falling down once every few weeks/months. But I also know the importance of consistency. I know that I will be able to achieve my ambitions only if I keep working on them consistently. The power of persistence and determination is not lost on me. So how can I stay consistent or at least not give up everything, lose my progress and come back to square one?

I think I have to accept that my nature is such that my productivity will come in ebbs and flows. I have to accept that there will be periods of great productivity followed by periods of low to no productivity. Once I accept my nature, I can stop working against it and instead create an approach that uses this to my advantage.

Having accepted my nature the next question is how can I keep making progress towards my goal despite this non-consistent nature? The answer lies in keeping to get up after every downturn. Even though I know I cannot keep working consistently all the time and I will fall off the wagon at some point, what I can do is to keep getting back up and keep coming back to the same goals again and again and again. This way though my consistency is not in staying on track 100% of the time but it lies in consistently getting back on track after every failure.

I know I will fall off the wagon. I also know that I have to keep coming back up to work towards my goals again and again. So can I design an approach that helps me make that transition faster? Is there a system I can follow to get back up faster after I fall off the wagon? There must be and if not then I should try and come up with such a system.

The first step to building that system is to try and understand how and why I fall off the wagon. The reason for me is mostly one of the following:

1. I go out somewhere where I am not able to follow my routine for a few days. I am not able to eat healthily, I don’t have a piano there to practice, or I simply don’t get the time to do reading and writing or work on any other goal I have. This breaks up any momentum I have built. Since my momentum is broken, inertia builds up. I am not able to start back up immediately after I return to my home and back to my normal routine. And ultimately my lazy unproductive period begins.

2. I pick up so many tasks that I spread myself too thin. With so many goals and so many directions I am pulling myself in, either I am not able to give time to everything that I want to do or I make so little progress each week that I don’t see the results and thus don’t feel motivated to keep working. It also leads to burnout of sorts where I feel I am done working on goals and need a break.

The obvious question to ask now is how can I tackle the above two issues:

1. For point 1 above the key to understanding is that the reason I am not able to get back up again is that my momentum is broken. There is inertia built up. So I cannot expect myself to get back up to the same level of productivity on day 1 of getting back from the break. To overcome inertial and build momentum, I need to start again in small baby steps. for eg, instead of expecting that I will read a book for 1 hour, I can say I will read for 5 min. Instead of saying I will exercise for an hour, I can say I will exercise for 5 min. The key here is not to expect to get back to my previous levels of productivity on the first day itself but to do small actions that will compound over days to get me back to my same level of productivity.

2. To avoid point 2 in the first place, I need to prioritize my goals. I need to see if there is a goal that I can drop or postpone working on. To do this I can ask myself a few questions. Is this goal still as important to me as I initially thought? Is this the right goal to work on right now? Can defer working on it? If I don’t achieve this will it really make any difference? I have to understand that if I keep trying to achieve 10s of goals at the same time, I will end up achieving none at all. As Oliver Emberton explains here, if there is a ball full of bees, and all the bees are trying to take the ball in a different direction, the ball would end up going nowhere. Instead, if I can reduce the bees or try to align them in such a way that they move in the same direction then I can get my ball moving. In the same way, I need to pick goals that are aligned with one another. I have to group goals in such a way that they work in synergy and pull me in one direction instead of dividing my focus and attention into 10 different things.

Now that I have tackled how I fall off the wagon and what to do to minimize it, the next thing to think of is what to do if I fall off the wagon. How to get back up? This will again depend on what got me off the wagon in the first place.

1. If I got off the wagon as I went somewhere where I was not able to follow my routine, then as mentioned previously I need to focus on building momentum. I need to start again from very small steps and try and get back to previous productivity levels in small stages spread over a period of days. The key here is to start small and adjust my own expectation.

2. If it is point 2, where I fall off the wagon because of burnout, I need to accept that I need a break. Maybe for a few days, I should take a break and do anything I feel like doing without judging myself for it. I need to accept that I am a human and not a machine. I need periods of rest and recovery. To do that I can maybe take a break from diet and indulge in something I like, maybe replace heavy workouts will light strolls, maybe spend more time with family. I can focus on rest and recharge for a few days so that I become rejuvenated to work on my goals again with fresh vigor. I can probably take a week off from my routine. Once I feel I am rested, I can start following the approach of point 1 of starting small and building momentum again one day at a time.

I feel confident that if I follow these steps I can keep getting back up and keep making progress towards my goals despite falling off again and again. If you feel there is something else I can add to it please feel free to let me know. If you also face the same issue as me maybe this post will help you.

I started reading all of them and I cried when I saw that the person they describe isn't me anymore. 

Through the pass of time I've become a different person and not a best version of myself, I actually became more like a sad, bitter and conformist guy. Of course I would like to be the very best version of myself but even though I try I always end up going back to my old self. 

I've been reflecting about myself and been thinking that perhaps due to my personality disorders (narcissist and egocentric) I am doomed to be like this always.

What causes some people to get stuck in self-absorption and never even try to self-improve?,5,smbtai,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smbtai/what_causes_some_people_to_get_stuck_in/,3,"What is it that makes some people have such a limited mindset that they can only ""see"" within the narrow range of themself or their own little world, whereas some people have a much wider range of vision and can ""see"" and take into consideration the needs and concerns of others as well?

It is a topic that rather fascinates me, because I think in many ways it is at the core of so many problems in our world.

A child is born into this world innocent, but primarily self-centered. If a baby wants to scream and cry in the middle of a service where hundreds of other people just want peace and quiet, the baby cries. If a baby wakes up in the middle of the night and wants to start screaming, it screams. If a child is being fed food and they want to throw their food at the wall and at other people, they throw it. There just is no capacity in an infant or a very young child to restrain these self-centered impulses.

Naturally, because they are innocent and do not know any better, we indulge them. No one tries to explain to the infant screaming at 3 am that perhaps he or she should consider that mom and dad needs to sleep as they have a very busy day tomorrow! We just get that you cannot reason with infants and extremely young children, so we coddle them and continue to feed them or continue to wake up at 3 am when they cry.

Yet something happens to human beings as they grow and develop over the years. The natural hope in the process of development is that the ""infantile"" mind that we are all given at birth will slowly begin to expand and grow. Whereas a baby cannot really see beyond it's own nose, we hope that as a child grows it's range of ""vision"" and insight will continuously expand outward. We hope that the child will learn to take into consideration the needs, feelings and concerns of others, and make healthy choices that will benefit all - not just themselves. Even if they end up a hermit on a mountaintop, singing just to the birds, we hope that their mind will be able to take in all the world, respecting and valuing it everything and everyone alike.

Yet I think that we know this does not happen to everyone at the same rate. And that is ok. Every life is different and no two people have walked in the same shoes. We cannot expect everyone to be exactly the same. As long as they are growing, that is what matters.

But some people seem to reach a certain level of growth, and they just stay there. It is as though they learn how to function in the world rather than lay in a crib and wait to be coddled, but their capabilities have only been developed just enough to be in service of themselves. They might go on in life and become incredibly successful in the eyes of the world, even making vast fortunes. They might have beautiful cars, beautiful homes, beautiful wives and apparently beautiful lives.

But on some level they are still like that toddler who, if he wants to throw his food at the wall, throws his food at the wall and could care less how it effects anyone else. If they want to wake up at 3 am and have a tantrum, they wake up at 3 am and have a tantrum regardless of who needs to sleep. There is something inside of them that never developed past a very, very young stage, even if their bodies have matured and even become very, very old.

Now some people, through one reason or another, they wake up to this at some point in life. They realize that for whatever reason, they got ""stuck,"" and they work on trying to fix that. It might be a struggle for them, but they do try, and that is a good. It is never a matter of when, but if. Life is a journey, and no two journeys are alike. It just matters that someone takes the step, buys the ticket, and gets on the train. It just matters that they try, because trying means growth is there. There is no stagnation.

But why is it that there are some who never seem to ""wake up?"" What causes some people to simply develop to a certain level, stop, and never realize that they are actually stuck? Why do you end up with elderly people who cannot see past their nose, and yet can find some young person who sees the needs of the whole world and cares? And of course, all kinds of variations of caring/not caring in between.

I liken it to a person sitting in a very huge, dark room with one very small, tiny, tiny light next to them. Like those tiny lights on keychains, that barely illuminate anything. They can basically just see themselves and maybe a little beyond. Yet they have the capacity to turn on lights that would enliven the entire house and show them everything, but for some reason they just have that one tiny light going, and they never even think how nice it might be if they could see everything and see it very clearly and well.

Anyways, I know that this long, and so most people probably will not read this far, but it is just a topic that I find interesting. What causes some minds to get stuck in that tiny, narrow mental space of self-absorption, and never even think to want more? What causes some to grow and expand and see the needs of others, whereas some can only ever see the needs of themself?",1644192379.0

"If you have a negative self image, is the subconscious mind an enemy or a misguided ally?",2,smam30,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/smam30/if_you_have_a_negative_self_image_is_the/,2,"Hi there. I have been learning more about self image and the principle that we generally act in accordance with our self image (mainly from works like PsychoCybernetics). I've been interested in the mechanics behind this and this is my question: **If you have a negative self image, does the subconscious mind act as an enemy that directly tries to maintain your bad circumstances, or does is act as a misguided ally that through its efforts to avoid your bad circumstances ultimately keeps you in them?**

*Example* (1) \~ You may have a person who believes that they are unlikeable and that they will always fail in relationships. The person laments about feeling lonely but when someone shows that they like this person and invites them out, the person turns down the invitation. Does the person do this because their sub conscious is trying to uphold their negative beliefs about themselves by keeping them alone, or is this their sub conscious' misguided attempt at trying to protect the relationship from failing. i.e. they believe that the person inviting them out will find them unlikable if they go out together so, to avoid this, they turn down the invitation, ironically leading to the relationship failing.

*Example* (2) \~ If a student believes that they are 'dumb' and has an exam coming up, they might not study as hard for it as they may believe that they'd fail no matter what. Since the student doesn't study, they fail, which reinforces their initial self image of being 'dumb'. Here we see some clear self sabotage and I'm interested in whether the subconscious is causing this directly or indirectly. i.e. is the student's subconscious mind actively trying to keep them 'dumb' by avoiding studying in order to stay consistent with their self image, or is the self sabotage their subconscious mind's misguided attempt at avoiding feeling stupid (e.g. if they don't study, they don't have to revise difficult material as studying the difficult material makes them feel dumb)?",1644189164.0

I would say something or take action on something and then look back and see where I could improve.
This is a common method that I'm sure everyone uses to a degree.  

But it started to cause issues as I was doing it too much, as I felt a part of me was judging another part and I was never good enough. 
No matter how much I improved... I wasn't “perfect”. There was always a little more improving I could do. 

I would achieve something awesome, and my mind would just go “yep but you could have done this, and it would have been better.”  Essentially blocking myself from celebrating anything I did. 

There was also this judgement on others. Always seeing what they were doing wrong.  Sometimes even calling them out on it. 
""You should be doing this"" or ""you shouldn't do that.” This can be ok if it comes from a place of caring, and in the right timing/situation, 

I was doing it to people around me too often as my mind was wired so heavily on pointing out the wrongs in the world…as I was doing within myself.

If anyone is going too hard on themselves just remember where you came from and how much you have already grown. Yes, there will always be a few things to improve upon… 

 It doesn't mean you don't deserve a pat on the back!
Celebrate your wins as you fucking deserve it!! Much love <3",1644175974.0

I am on some random Facebook groups (it's still popular among zoomers in my country) and well sometimes I stalk their profiles, almost fucking everyone my age has photos with friends or at least some people commenting shit on their profiles. And I know a lot of people meet through those Facebook groups, but how in the flying fuck they do it?

I already gave up on having friends IRL, but seriously is it that hard to have friends online, when I spend 16 hours daily in front of PC?  Am I that much unable to make friends? How hard can it be?? And I don't even have a strong social anxiety or asperger's or something. Am I doomed? 99% of the people have at least some friends, so it shoudn't be that fucking hard.

I'm not adding another objective for now, I'll try to apply those I gave myself better. So, I'll plan for the next day right now and follow up with what I did and didn't do tomorrow.

1-Sleep at least 8 hours (take melatonin if there's less than that left before I go to bed) and don't sleep in (cause it'll fuck with any sleep schedule I try to maintain).

2- Study at least two hours a day with full focus and with a max of 6 five minutes pauses (not included in two hours). Finish work that's due in less than a week first then study a bit of each subject. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

3- Try to go rapidly over what's going to be in class before it. Keep focus while in class and at least keep note of what's important

4- Make sure to always be hydrated and to have eaten enough. Also, keep a 30 minutes slot for hygiene (personal and of the house).

5- Work out at least a little bit, even if it's just 5 minutes. If I'm sitting down for a long time, get up at least every 30 minutes and do some jumping jacks.

6- Plan your day by chosing what to do each hour. Also, stretch before going to bed, even if just a little bit.

A Manual/Guide on how to Fix Sleep,16,slq1n7,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/slq1n7/a_manualguide_on_how_to_fix_sleep/,4,"I've seen many people struggle with sleep. This may be that they feel tired in the morning and can't fall asleep in the evening. Others struggle with sticking to a sleeping schedule, stay up way past bedtime and sleep in on the next day.

After reading a lot about sleep and fixing my own sleeping schedule, it's about time to share the knowledge and help others fix their sleep!

&#x200B;

First, you should know that your sleep is controlled by a lot of different hormones which for example tell your body how awake or tired you are. I won't go into much depth about hormones since this is about how to fix your sleep and not necessarly on how the underlying biology works.  
If you notice trouble with your sleep, your hormones are probably out of balance and/or rhythm. Luckily there are some great ways to basically ""factory reset"" these hormones.

**Go for a walk each morning**  
Your hormones do not have a perfect 24-hour-rhythm because this kind of rhythm doesn't really exist. We can't just look at a clock for our body to know what time it is. Our body gets its time from light. Light dictates to our bodies what time it is.  
If we go for a walk each morning (after sunrise!), we receive a ton of light. This light tells our body what time it is and helps our hormones to get back into their rhythms again. Light is essential for good sleep.  
Keep in mind that the outside lighting on a cloudy day is still about 10 times as intense as the lighting inside of a well lit building. It will not be sufficient to turn on the lights while staying inside. You'll have to get out of your house, 20-30 minutes will already do the deal.

&#x200B;

**Reduce or even stop drinking caffeine**  
Hormones again. Long story short: Caffeine blocks the receptors which are responsable for measuring the amount of adenosine (you can view this as a by-product of brain activity). If these receptors are blocked, they won't be able to measure the concentration of adenosine which will lead to your body **not knowing how tired you are**.  
Caffeine does NOT give you energy. However, it may put you in a better state of mind (which better sleep may do as well!).  
Caffeine is also able to stay within your body for multiple hours or even days since its half life time (the time after which only half the amount of caffeine remains) is really **dependant on your age and your body composition**. Assuming it takes 8h to half the amount of caffeine and you have a morning coffee with 200mg of caffeine, when going to bed again 16 hours later, there will still be 50mg of caffeine left. This is about equal to drinking a 200ml can of red bull right before going to bed.

&#x200B;

**Turn off your devices**  
From our current knowledge, blue light keeps us awake. To be more specific: Light with a wavelength of about 490nm signals our body to stay awake and productive.  
You can make use of night mode which removes these wavelengths from your display but putting your phone down in the evening is the save call.  
And, you almost guessed it, this is also related to hormones!  
This light supresses the release of melatonin, a sleep-hormone.

&#x200B;

**Summary**  
Your sleep is controlled by your hormones. Too little light in the morning or too much (especially blue) light in the evening as well as caffeine can affect your natural hormonal rhythm. This leads to you being awake longer in the evening and tired again in the morning.

Get some fresh air in the morning, put your phone away at least an hour before bedtime, and reduce your caffeine intake.

&#x200B;

If you want an example how well this actually works:  
I've went from a 4am-1pm sleeping rhythm to a 9pm-5am rhythm within a few weeks and have not bounced back ever since.

I had a rough early 20's as i had depression/anxiety and spent a lot of time on my own instead of making friends at college. I also have jumped around different work places so although i made some friends at work they never lasted. 

I'm currently working from home due to COVID. The people i work with are ok, but they are a lot older than me and different (different hobbies,stages of their life etc) so i don't think there's many people at work i could actually hang out with.

I play some indoor soccer (futsal) once a week with a team but most of the time it's just pick up games with random people each week. I also joined a soccer team but we train once a week and play on the weekend. The team I play i'm friends with them but only just see them at soccer. 

Each weekend i feel really lonely with nothing to do. I have some friends form high school i hang out with sometimes (e.g. on Friday i went to play pool with my friend) but then saturday/sunday i have nothing to do. I get depressed. I feel like most people in their lat 20's already have their established social group and friends. 

What can I do? or do I just accept it? Should I just go to things and do things by myself? e.g. go to a museum by myself? i getsad as i wish i could share those experiences with someone.",1644111734.0

I’ll find a show, or a video game, or a fidget toy and I’ll literally only do or watch that one thing for MONTHS at a time in my spare time. For example, I have been in an Overwatch obsession since May and I basically haven’t explored any other interests since then. I played a little bit of other games but not that much. My resolution this year was to relax and not overwhelm myself with a busy schedule, so I’m taking less work hours, less classes at school, and less commitments in my volunteer life. Recently, my days have basically looked like this: do what little school and work I have, and then play Overwatch with my friends or watch Overwatch content for the rest of my spare time. Personally, I love this setup. I feel very relaxed and in my little personal bubble and like I am isolated from the world’s garbage. But I sometimes feel like I may be hiding too much. Like I’m not getting any new information if that makes sense. I’m not trying new interests, I’m not keeping up that much with the news (just the basics). I feel like people my age (20f) are constantly seeking out new knowledge and experiences and I personally just don’t feel the motivation to do this. I love what I have right now but I’m worried it’s going to come back to bite me in the future because I’m not knowledgeable in random life facts or in social activism or whatever. Like I have a solid foundation of all of these things, I’ve had many conversations about social issues with my friends and in my classes. I’m not clueless but I am worried that if I don’t constantly hunt to learn new things I’ll become behind everyone else if that makes sense. Like maybe my tunnel visioning so much on one thing at a time is actually harmful even though I love it.

Don’t Let Past-You Stop The Present-You From Moving Forward In Life,7,slr8xf,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/slr8xf/dont_let_pastyou_stop_the_presentyou_from_moving/,0,"I get you, I know the pain you’re feeling…

It’s the pain of something you once did in the past that you simply can’t shake off. Rather than shaking your head with embarrassment, you feel the pain inside of your core, you get a lump in the throat and wanting to shed some tears because of how damning your mistakes were in the past. It doesn’t matter if these mistakes were made last year, 2 years ago, 3 years ago and so on, whenever it was, you must realise that they have shaped you up into the person you are today. It starts with realisation… realising what you did in the past was wrong and you shouldn’t done it. Sure, it may be too late for some people, but now you’ve got that feeling, rather than committing the same mistakes over and over again, you’ve stopped, you’ve realised it and you’ve changed the manner about you. Be proud of that step because it’s incredibly hard to change yourself without nobody else asking you too, instead, you pulled the trigger yourself, you put your own foot down, you wanted change and nobody else. 

We hear the phrase all the time… “the past is the past”, but you know what? It truly is. The person you were years ago isn’t the same person you are today, you’ve grown to build this knowledge and realisation, and it’s never too late to build on this. Sure, what you once did was shameful, but I’m going to give you that second chance, I’m going to give you another reason for me to trust you again, for you to show me who you really are and what you’ve got in you. Because, deep down, what everyone of us really needs is a kick up the backside and someone screaming “WAKE UP”, but instead of doing that, I hope this post will help you make better decision and guide you into the right path of life. 

Mistakes happen, awful ones, terrible ones and unforgivable ones. But, at the end of the day, the only person who can truly give you a second chance is yourself. If you’re sitting there with your hands in your head and asking yourself over and over again “why did I do that?” as soon as you wake up and the last thing you do before you go to sleep, you will never move on with your life, you’re never going to experience what life truly is, and that’s laughter, joy and love. Instead of building yourself up, you’re tearing yourself down by each brick, everyday. You need to cement yourself as a human being that once made mistakes, a lot of them, and you know what? You’ll continue to make them, as we all do, and sure as hell I do, too.  

Life will guide you into the right direction at the right time, and I fully believe that time for you, is right now. Beating yourself up for days, weeks and months prior has done nothing for your growth and progression, but instead it’s breaking you down, this is not YOU. The second you give yourself a second chance in life, the more positive and happier you will become. You won’t shed millions of tears anymore, you won’t have sleepless nights every night, you won’t shy away from doing the things you love to do, you will be motivated to turn your life around and start from scratch again. Is there a clock on growth? Is there a clock on learning from your mistakes? Is there a clock to becoming a better you? Absolutely not. The people who decided to turn their life around had 1 very simply decision to make… and that was to DECIDE. They DECIDED to make this leap of faith. With that decision, motivation is crucial. Changing your life around for the better isn’t going to work in a few days or weeks, it’s a continuous process that is never-ending. Expect more from yourself, constantly learn and build new things, gain some knowledge or an education. 

Learn to live with your mistakes and apply it into making better decisions in the present and future. You’ve got what it takes to turn your life around and be better and by being better, you DO better. In life you make mistakes, you learn from them and you grown WITH them. We are human, we will make mistakes, as small as dropping something or as bad as a criminal activity. Realising what you did in the past and turning your life around shows grit, determination and a lot of heart. Deciding to becoming a better person shows exactly what kind of person you are, you want to do better, you want to be better and in the end, all of your efforts will be shown as you wake up in the morning with a smile on your face and realising how far you’ve truly come.",1644133503.0
I'm a 19 year old loser.,3,slxbuk,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/slxbuk/im_a_19_year_old_loser/,6,"I know i should be positive, but it is what it is. No matter how much I try to improve myself, I fail everyday. The girl I used to love just broke up saying ""GOODBYE LEAVE ME ALONE"", 3 heartbreaks already in the past. I'm the only child, and I'm super lonely. I have no cousins or close friends. I have a toxic mother who yells at the top of her voice everyday, and I have overprotective parents who treat me like shit. They won't let me go out. My father stays out of city 6 days a week and only comes home on Sunday, and when he does, my parents fight all the time. They don't even respect me, everytime I get criticized and yelled at for my slightest of mistakes. I have no friends, the ones I used to have left me, and I just feel like a complete shit rn. Got bullied almost throughout my entire school for being weak and dark-skinned. I'm a freshman in college, ..and I don't wanna start it all again. I was addicted to porn and bad stuff, and I'm still struggling to get over it. I have no one to talk to, or listen, and it just keeps on getting worst everyday. My mental health got worst in this lockdown, I'm trapped in my home and my mind since almost 3 years now. I used to come first in my class till highschool, that I thought that was because I was intelligent, but it was just because of my mother, she didnt allow me to do other things, always criticized for my mistakes.

The mesmerization of sleep drifting [the constant self 7],1,sm2oaq,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sm2oaq/the_mesmerization_of_sleep_drifting_the_constant/,1,"Can you feel it? Can you feel it again? The serene fleeting feeling of numbness. The underdeveloped shiver of invisible goosebumps under your skin. Your numb gaze peering aimlessly at the unseen essence roaming in the distance with a futile attempt to discern it. As if the meaning is hidden within that haze…

In a way you like this feeling. You cannot attain it voluntarily and you cherish that comfortable numbness. Sometimes it descends upon you in times of indecisiveness or exhaustion. The feeling of a ponderous cloud floating weightless, ready to succumb to every whim of the wind. A cloud inflated and overflowing with rain drops. But will it rain?

You like keeping all the heavy raindrops tucked inside, it gives the feeling of weightless floating. You are free from the fetters of the world. Your skin is chill, evaporating the droplets outside the brim. Eventually you will descend. The droplets will fall and the hazy cloud will give way to the calmness of the starry night.

The gust of the second wind descents on your head like a nimbus ready to rain.

The heavy and sparse raindrops fall. The sun sets. It gives way to a starry night.

>*To die – to sleep,*  
*No more; and by sleep to say we end*  
*The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks*  
*That flesh is heir to: ‘tis a consummation*  
*Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;*  
\- Hamlet, William Shakespeare 

To die… To sleep… To slumber… To recover… To rejuvenate… To rebirth…

Some people postpone the gratitude of going to sleep as much as possible. As if these fleeting, restless hours would bring some much-awaited comforts of aptitude, as a solace that the day is not lost to unfulfilling or mindless drifting. Until the last hour, when the conscious mind succumbs to the unconscious, and similar to the expired day of drift, at the expired hour our mind drifts to sleep. Thus, the secret sleep is ruined. The secret sleep, the metamorphoses of rebirth. When we recharge, recover and gain new strength. The serene slumber is ruined, and the vicious circle of unfulfilled drifting starts anew.

Sleep well. Put the destructing blue light of the screen as far as possible. Tomorrow the sun will rise again. You will regain your strength and the first thing you will do is the diligent cleaning of body, mind, sole and surroundings. Then away with some work, so your spirit is blessed with the serene sleep and you start over the path of your refinement.

Trying to disassociate from politics,2,slwsy9,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/slwsy9/trying_to_disassociate_from_politics/,0,"I have found politics to ultimately rot my connections with people. It has made me say things just in order to annoy others or challenge them and it has made me to demonise those with differing views in the worst cases.

Both those on the left and right are often corrupted in their motivations, and a lot of us political just to satisfy an ego in some sort of a narcissistic, twisted way. A lot of radical conservatives and a lot of radical modern liberals function under the same motivations.

I have decided to lay off politics and and focus on reading, gym, and conscientious work- the general self improvement practises ive usually done, but exclude political interest and delve even deeper in those practises

I decide to worry about my issues and the issues of those around me. Improve my life to improve the world, not the other way around. Anyone on the same route, I would be glad to hear any tips on the way that helped you. I mainly do this due to the alienation ive felt from the outside world due to my political interests during the past 2 years. I wanna improve my relationships and acceptance of others.

The discipline of intention.,3,sls2tm,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sls2tm/the_discipline_of_intention/,0,"Hi there,

Our world is getting more complicated, and so are our lives. It’s increasingly difficult to find time. So, we choose the default mode, autopilot. We take it, making sure it’s temporary. 

“As soon as I’m done with this, I will take some time for myself.” 

But the race doesn’t stop. One demand pushes the other. And our default choice, autopilot, encourages this. We quickly accumulate the “Yes’s” ( A new car, house, TV, project, responsibility). Together they accelerate our infernal machine. And our lives become even more complicated. 

It would not be a problem if the effects were minor. 

But how many missed careers, broken family lives, financial failures, chronic fatigue, addictions, burnouts, depressions are born and nourished in this life choice by default. 

What to do? 

So simple on paper but more complicated in practice as all activities that bring value. It’s about taking back control of our lives through a process of reflection and action. 

Reflection & actions : 

* **Define your intention:** What I want to achieve in the different parts of my life. Emotionally, intellectually, physically and spiritually. 
* **Assess your current situation:** What is my reality? Being aware of it is the first step. 
* **Create your options:** What are my possibilities? Most of what you aspire to have already been done. Ask, read, learn. You’ll refine your options and prepare for the next steps. One of the advantages of our new (complex) world is that all information is just one click away. 
* **Action:** Start small, but start. Each step will give you more appetite and allow you to adjust the direction. 

Whether you get there or not is less important than taking your new path. You go from being in autopilot mode to creating a life of intention. 

Despite what we think, time flies, and many people arrive at the end with “I should have.”

So let’s enjoy it now and take the time for reflection and action. 

I wish you a life of intention. ",1644136831.0
I need to stop ordering food and make my own dinners,90,sl9ecg,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sl9ecg/i_need_to_stop_ordering_food_and_make_my_own/,53,"Hi all,

I order takeaway way too much, and it costs a lot. My goal in the coming months is to reduce my dependency on this and make more of my dinners.

Often times I justify ordering by saying I don’t have the energy, I don’t have the time. I’ve tried meal prepping in the past and then I’ve not eaten what I’ve prepped. It’s just not as tasty or fulfilling as what I order. I’ve bought ingredients and then watched them rot in the fridge.

A lot of times, I feel the world can be a very mean and tough world. The violence, the environment being destroyed. But I have not given up hope.

I'm a really bad listener. I interrupt people a lot and when they are talking its basically just a waiting game. I'm not fully listening and just wanting for my turn to speak. I also get REALLY upset over little things. Things most people wouldn't get bothered by really bother me. I feel a need to justify everything I do. I try my best to be perfect and try to hide every flaw. I won't try new things because then I'll be bad at it and embarrass myself. I find it really hard to just admit fault because then I see myself as a bad person and hate myself. I don't apologize for mistakes unless I literally have to. A lot of the time, I split and see people as either good or bad. I either hate them or love them. I lack empathy too. I really, really want to feel for people but I feel nothing. Nothing at all. I don't care if bad things happen to people unless it affects me in some way.
