Mod Post: Attention Adult Content Sellers!,173,rf2x49,FreeCompliments,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCompliments/comments/rf2x49/mod_post_attention_adult_content_sellers/,23,"This is a minor friendly subreddit with users as young as thirteen. As such, we are unable to host *any* accounts that feature adult content for sale. This includes 

- even if it's old.
- even if you are tagged as NSFW. 
- even if you are otherwise abiding by our rules. 
- even if you were told this is a good place to post. 
- even if you are abiding by Reddit's policy 
- even if you only do it occasionally and appropriately 
- even if you have only have sold content in selling subs. 

If your account is used to sell content, either in part or in whole, on any part of reddit (in your bio, in other subs, in comments, in posts, in pictures or other media), you *cannot* interact with this subreddit. Period. End of. 

We do not have an issue with *you*, the user behind the account. You are a perfectly nice human who deserves all the compliments in the world. We welcome *you* to interact on this subreddit and get your free compliments. But your *account* is not one we can host here because of our demographic. 

The only way to interact here if you have NSFW content for sale on your profile is to pick from the following options 

- **delete the NSFW content and either appeal your ban or do it before you interact here.** Great for: accounts with old selling content you don't need, accounts you're really attached to, people who don't care about their selling content. 

- **or, to make an account that does not feature NSFW selling content and engage here with that.** Great for: sex workers who use reddit for income, people who are happy to operate two accounts, people who don't want to delete content. 

These are the solutions. There are no third choices.",1639356786.0
Helpful clarification about flairs and titles,13,sgefp2,FreeCompliments,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCompliments/comments/sgefp2/helpful_clarification_about_flairs_and_titles/,2,"Hello.  We hate removing your posts so here are a few notes about how to flair and title your posts appropriately. 

#***Flair***  
‚Ä¢ **Pictures of yourself.**  
Did you post a picture of yourself? Flair it Selfie. Yes, even if your title has a question. Yes, even if you think your title is motivational. Yes, even if you didn't actually take the picture yourself. If you want a compliment on a picture of you, please flair it selfie.  

‚Ä¢ **Text posts**  
Question, Compliment, and Motivation are flairs for text posts where you are explicitly not seeking a compliment. 



#***Title***  
‚Ä¢ **Be positive.**  
Rule 1 applies to titles, too! If we wouldn't allow someone to leave it as a comment for you, we won't allow you to say it about yourself in your title so please, no ""My ex said I was fat"" or ""I looked so ugly here"" types of titles. A little self-deprecation is fine but we really are going for positivity here - not self roasts.  

‚Ä¢ **No sad stories.**  
Positivity also means no overly negative titles. We understand sometimes you need a mood boost and it's natural to share what has you down but if title after title is ""I'm suicidal"", ""My dog died"", ""My SO says I'm ugly daily"", or ""My life sucks right now"" it tends to bring down the mood of the sub. We want people to come here to feel good and make others feel good. Venting may help you but it could be triggering for many others. It's fine to say you need picking up but if you want to be more specific, you can comment on your post (with trigger warnings as appropriate).

‚Ä¢ **""Honest opinion""**  
We discourage people from asking for ""honest"" opinions. Only compliments are allowed on this sub. We like to think all the compliments are already honest anyway. A few times we've banned people for being insulting and their defense was ""they asked for an honest opinion"". We discourage asking for critique for the same reason. Tact can sometimes be hard to convey via text.

‚Ä¢ **Requesting non-compliments**  
Again, only compliments are allowed here. So please don't ask for friends, advice, ratings, ""guess my"" anything (age, ethnicity, hobbies, occupation, etc), first impressions, jokes, celebrity lookalikes, etc. What one may find flattering, another may find offensive and the answers to these questions aren't inherently complimentary.

‚Ä¢ **Self-promo**  
Please don't give your social media in your title, ask for DMs, offer to compliment or upvote everyone who compliments or upvotes you, or make any other offers in order to boost interaction with your post.",1643564731.0
