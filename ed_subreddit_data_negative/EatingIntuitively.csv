Lately I've seen some discussion about censorship within this subreddit so I thought I would tell you my criteria for bans and deletions when it comes to people disagreeing with parts of intuitive eating.

This is a subreddit for intuitive eating that is laid out in the book ""Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program that Works"" by Evelyn Tribole & Elyse Resch. This is not a subreddit to debate if parts of intuitive eating are ""right"". We welcome questions if you are unsure about aspects of intuitive eating, or if you are not sure why some things are included in the principles of intuitive eating. Questions and concerns presented by people willing to listen and learn from the responses will be left up. Posts and comments trying to argue against intuitive eating or parts of intuitive eating will be deleted. I do not ban people from this sub lightly; so far only one person has been banned. Only obvious trolls or people whose comments I have to repeatedly delete will be banned.",1589547745.0

How do I deal with so much anxiety about seeing family after I just started IE?,8,s9q5qn,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/s9q5qn/how_do_i_deal_with_so_much_anxiety_about_seeing/,12,"I have had an eating disorder since a very young child.

Help needed: can‚Äôt afford to indulge my junk food cravings,23,q0wip5,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/q0wip5/help_needed_cant_afford_to_indulge_my_junk_food/,24,"Hi all! I‚Äôm new to this subreddit but I‚Äôve been practicing IE for around a year. At first it worked really great; I listened to my body even when I was craving McDonald‚Äôs every day for weeks on end and eventually stopped craving it and even became mildly repulsed by it. Same thing happened with chips, cookies, and ice cream. 

But now for the past two months I‚Äôve found myself really struggling. I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for movie theater popcorn and found out about a year ago that I could get it delivered to my house. The first few months after finding that out were fine, I‚Äôd eat it here and there. But lately I‚Äôve been eating it two to three times a week. And the constant salt taste in my mouth seems to have somehow ‚Äúreactivated‚Äù my taste for McDonald‚Äôs because I‚Äôve started craving it again and LOVING the taste. So now I either order McDonald‚Äôs (on a food delivery app as well, so üí∏üí∏üí∏) or popcorn *every single day.* Often both on the same day. Last year (September 2020 to August 2021) I spent $2,000 on fast food. In the past month of September 2021 alone, I spent $800 on McDonald‚Äôs and popcorn.

I know a lot of it is definitely psychological; I‚Äôm a grad student and I suffer from double depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. All three are stable and going pretty good though thanks to medication and exercise. But I know they also play a role because making myself food is the #1 thing I struggle with the most in my life, depressed or not. And my current semester is hectic with the final year of my master‚Äôs, two part-time jobs, my role in the student association, plus funding and PhD applications for next year. But I‚Äôm doing good generally compared to other times in my life, so I don‚Äôt know why I would emotionally eat so much. But the crux of the matter is, I do want to eat comfort/junk food constantly, not even because it makes me feel good‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt anymore, it makes me feel awful‚Äîbut because my brain has learned that that‚Äôs what I do when I want to numb uncomfortable feelings. 

To go back to the IE aspect of it, I know that a lot of this craving is because I have started mentally restricting again: when I noticed myself eating more and more popcorn and McDonald‚Äôs, I started telling myself, ‚ÄúStarting tomorrow, no more fast food‚Äù and deleting the delivery app from my phone. So this obviously just keeps leading to more craving. But here‚Äôs the kicker: I cannot financially afford to buy this food anymore. This $800 last month set me back financially big time. Plus, I don‚Äôt even *want* to eat the food from a conscious perspective because it makes me feel awful afterwards, lethargic, bloated, gassy, plus it upsets my IBS. But it‚Äôs like when a craving kicks in, I am powerless and no longer in charge.

If you made it through this novel, you‚Äôre amazing and I love you. Any and all tips are appreciated!

TL;DR Spent $800 last month on fast food, can‚Äôt continue to spend like that but trying to stop feels like restriction and the cravings feel uncontrollable. What should I do?",1633314858.0

"I Hate Food, but I Hate being Thin",14,ou773d,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ou773d/i_hate_food_but_i_hate_being_thin/,20,"Tw; descriptions of food hatred and malnutrition 

I (20F) hate the way food makes me feel nauseated, bloated, and lethargic. I hate having to prepare it every day three times a day, and I hate digesting it. It‚Äôs such a magnificently huge time drain because it takes me so long to eat, and it‚Äôs a distraction from work and hobbies. I was raised a vegetarian so I have to eat extra calories and protein every day to make up for not eating meat. I don‚Äôt do that.
Because I‚Äôm anxious, I rarely feel hungry, so most days I end up eating one or two small meals, sometimes not eating a first meal until 3pm or later. This is terrible for my health. Side effects of being morbidly thin include: anemia, worse anxiety and depression, low energy, head hair falling out, increased body hair growth, body aches, stomach pains, easy bruising and injury because my bones and skin rub against one another, back pain from my spine rubbing against school chairs, and sleeping too much. 

My family, friends, and even neighbors have pointed out how much my being thin bothers them. I know it comes from a place of concern, but they bring it up at every single meal. Clothes in stores don‚Äôt usually fit me so I wear mostly old T-shirts and children‚Äôs jeans. All this kills my self-confidence and I hate my body because of how gross and emaciated it looks. I‚Äôve been to the doctor and a psychiatrist several times and they‚Äôve found nothing wrong except my weight and eating habits. I don‚Äôt want to be thin, but I rarely feel hungry anymore, and whenever I think about food I get angry that I‚Äôm thin and tired and so avoid eating further out of sheer stubbornness. 

As my therapist puts it: you don‚Äôt have an eating disorder but you have disordered eating.

Triggered by a YouTuber,14,ooj2ui,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ooj2ui/triggered_by_a_youtuber/,6,"Hey friends, this is a new account for me. I‚Äôve purged my old account of anything related to diet culture but it still had an ‚Äúicky‚Äù vibe around it and I wanted to start fresh (just sharing in case anyone wonders why my account is so new, haha). 

On why I returned to IE but you can skip ahead:

I started my IE journey today. Well, I have tried before. But I‚Äôve always found myself drawn back into diet culture, which of course has led to binge eating and poor mental health. Recently I had a near breakdown over my obsession with my weight and with food. Literally was staying up all night looking up information about how to overcome food ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù because I was convinced that I was addicted to food and would never change. Then going into work for 12 hour shifts after and continuing my research during my off time at work. Seriously. üòï 

One day last week I found myself completely exhausted and I sat with myself for awhile and realized how bad my mental health was. I was suicidal at that point. And I accepted that obsession with these things was literally killing me and ruining my quality of life. So now I‚Äôm here, and I‚Äôm starting again. I‚Äôve ordered the workbook, guided journal, and card deck off of Amazon and I have the book and daily reader already.

ON TOPIC HERE:

Anyway, I was scrolling through YT today, just relaxing and feeling all the good freedom vibes you get when starting this awesome journey. Then I see a YouTuber called ObesetoBeast and he posted a video about another YouTuber, Trisha Paytas. And he calls this video ‚ÄúTrisha Paytas is Fat and has Eating Issues.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt tell you why this video is triggering me so badly. I don‚Äôt watch Trisha‚Äôs content except very occasionally and I watched Frenemies for awhile before it was cancelled. She‚Äôs problematic and I recognize that in her. I also know she‚Äôs very wrapped up in diet culture and has a poor image of herself, and people make fun of her looks pretty regularly.

IDK just the fact that he posted this video and so many people are probably supportive of him doing so, just because of Trisha‚Äôs body size. 

I‚Äôm in a larger body, one bigger than Trisha, and it just hurts. I feel this deep empathy for her even though I abhor some of the things she says (conflicting!). It makes me angry and also so sad that complete strangers continue to believe they have the right to speak so negatively about women in larger bodies. Because they‚Äôre just trying to be helpful, or because ‚Äúfacts are facts,‚Äù or because they‚Äôre taking a stand against obesity, or whatever excuse they have to be a bully. 

I guess I just needed to vent about how I‚Äôm feeling but I also wanted to ask, how do you guys handle getting triggered like this? I get that the world is fully steeped in diet culture and avoiding this stuff is impossible. But it‚Äôs still hard to see it. Ya know?

Anyway, thanks for reading my lengthy ramblings. It helped some to know this is a safe space here.",1626843025.0
Feel like giving up,11,on89f1,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/on89f1/feel_like_giving_up/,28,"Hey friends, I hope this isn‚Äôt too depressing but I am so overwhelmed and sad and just tired.

I‚Äôm morbidly obese and I have tried to start my IE journey a few times but I always end up falling back on the dieting wagon. Usually this is because something happens with my health that scares me and makes me feel like if I don‚Äôt lose weight I will die young (I‚Äôm 30). One time my doctor said we had to handle my weight issue or I would be headed for danger - she made me feel like it was do or die. She said my blood pressure was too high and I had to make changes right now.

Every day I start out either attempting IE or dieting, just depending on the day. And by the end of the day I have these horrific binge eating episodes that leave me feeling so sick and disgusted with myself. I really feel like I‚Äôm killing myself but the more I try to restrict the worse my eating gets.

Struggling w/ Shopping for Clothes,12,of3kku,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/of3kku/struggling_w_shopping_for_clothes/,6,"Trigger Warning - Weight loss is mentioned, but no specific numbers. 

Hey all, I was just looking for advice about a certain issue. 

I‚Äôve been practicing intuitive eating and I have ultimately lost weight. I don‚Äôt know how much because I do not keep a scale and my intent wasn‚Äôt to lose weight. I was binge eating a LOT when I started my journey and so this was a natural occurrence of learning to listen to my internal hunger signals. I know this is a controversial topic for some people, but IE does result in weight loss for some, and I happened to be one of those individuals who dropped weight. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

One major reason I‚Äôm aware of the WL is because my clothes are becoming baggy and loose. I now realize I need new essential items like jeans, leggings, underwear, things that I wear on the regular. But I am afraid to go shopping. I don‚Äôt know what clothing size I would wear, I haven‚Äôt paid attention to sizes since I started, and I‚Äôm afraid I will be triggered by this. Logically I know clothing sizes don‚Äôt mean anything. I know I can try to test the clothes by holding them up to my body and kind of guessing at what would fit, but it would be pretty difficult to not utilize sizing (ex. I love this dress, might need to go down a size! I‚Äôll go grab the other size). 

So ultimately I‚Äôm pretty overwhelmed and confused about how to handle shopping for clothes and this whole process. I do NOT want to turn this into a diet/weight loss issue in my mind and I don‚Äôt want to mess up my progress with IE, which has been life changing for me. 

On top of this, I thought I would ask how you handle being told your weight at the doctor. Sometimes they tell me even if I specify that I do not want to know. Has anyone reached a neutrality towards these numbers or are they always triggering and upsetting?

Thanks ahead of time. I know even discussing this topic can be difficult for some of us and I appreciate everyone‚Äôs insight.",1625603870.0

Rationing food on a low income,15,nk6cw1,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/nk6cw1/rationing_food_on_a_low_income/,21,"Hey. I'm on a pretty low income. By living with a parent, spending nothing on entertainment, saving nothing, and getting a relative to cover my phone bill, I typically have about $40-50 to spend on food each week. That's only if I don't need money for clothes or something.

I realize that $40 or $50 is not SUPER low, but I have a high appetite so far, and it has always been a tight squeeze for me.

Inevitably, I end up spending some of it on fast food. I can't stop myself. But overall, what I do is carefully ration it out, so that I always have food during the last week of the month. And it never feels like I have enough.

I'm starting to wonder if my well-intentioned rationing is backfiring. It might be keeping me from healing. I rarely get to eat some of the foods I love, because I'm always trying to ration for that last week.

Whenever I've talked with people with similar incomes, they've said, ""I'm always hungry the last week of the month."" They seem to eat more at the beginning, then taper off. They're not rationing as much as I am.

It makes me wonder if that's the more normal, intuitive way to eat when you're poor. But I'm terrified to try it. What if I'm miserable?! What if I get so desperate for food in that last week, I overdraw my bank account?

Does anyone have experience with this?",1621885171.0

Summer here and so is great produce (I live in SC) and there are a lot more fresh and delicious tastes to be had. It's hot, so my usual standby meals are just too long and heat up the house too much. And there is only so many ways I can spin a salad.

My anxiety around food can be overwhelming/ Difference between neutral and satiation?,18,ngknbc,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ngknbc/my_anxiety_around_food_can_be_overwhelming/,14,"TW: Binge, anxiety

I've been binge free for almost a week now. I've had lots of binge free weeks/months in the past but things have been especially hard these past 2 months due to finals.

I've been diligently following the intuitive eating principals that resonate with me, such as eating without distractions, taking the time to acknowledge my hunger and fullness, and eating the foods that I desire.

Yet it's so so scary. I'm so afraid of when I'll crack, when I'll eat a little too much past my fullness, when I'll binge. I'm scared of the chips and icecream in my kitchen even though I haven't touched it. I feel hungry often, so I'm scared that I'm accidentally undereating and will crack and binge due to that.

I get hungry like every 2-3 hours and I'll make a balanced meal but I'll stop eating the moment I get to neutral, which only takes eating 1/4 of my plate most of the time. I don't know what satiation or satisfaction is like and I'm scared to go past it. All I know is hungry, neutral, and a stretched, nauseous stomach from overeating/binging. I'm scared that I'll mess up, disappoint myself and everyone, afraid to fail. I know there's no right or wrong, no actual failing, and I'm the first person to believe in myself but damn, I'm scared.

What in the world does satiation feel like? The moment I eat a bite or two beyond neutral I get an intense wave of anxiety and I feel all of the diet thoughts attack me. I feel like a bad person for eating 1 or 2 raviolis beyond neutral, like my character depends on my ability to ""control"" myself from eating. I dislike this feeling. I know I'll be okay. I know I'll get through this. But damn, it sucks.",1621467292.0

I love the principles of IE, and when I am eating mindfully and intuitively, it always feels great. The problem is, I rarely am able to eat that way! Over the years I‚Äôve formed the habit of binging while watching TV. No matter what kind of mood I‚Äôm in, no matter what else is going on, if I decide to have a TV binge, the food inevitably goes along with it. Today, for example, it was an entire box of Entenmann‚Äôs donuts. I KNEW I wasn‚Äôt hungry, but I couldn‚Äôt stop eating until the box was empty. 
I‚Äôm trying really hard to NOT restrict myself, so I buy one or two ‚Äúplay foods‚Äù with my grocery shopping- but even though I know I should be eating healthier foods, I still always opt for the play foods first and then binge on them.

I became malnourished and didn't think I had a problem until I went for a visit to my OBGYN and it was my gynecologist who had to tell me how worried she was for me. I was in shock and scared, my mother didn't care and I recovered all on my own with the help of an older friend who basically guided me through it all. My body seems to have found a weight range that it wants to be at and I accept it, I don't restrict anymore, I eat what I want whenever I want and I don't feel bad about it but recently, I was let go from my first job and my shady boss' reason was that I wasn't fit to work there because I'm always complaining about my leg and back f.y.i I literally have scoliosis and my mom took this opportunity to come into my bedroom the next morning to sit down and tell me about how she thinks the real reason my boss let me go is because he thinks that I'm fat and unhealthy, I sat there in shock at what I was hearing and I started to defend myself by informing here with everything that I learned about the human body that is true and not the diet culture B.S. she was spouting to me--she claimed to have understood and then left but 2 nights later her and I got into a big fight and she brought it up again but much worse...she held up my leg (i was sitting on the couch) and told me that it was too big and that I ""eat too much"" and that hurt a lot. I told my therapist about this but unfortunately it seems that she's wrapped up in diet culture as well...she agreed that what my mom said to me was terrible and reassured me that even if my weight was an issue for the boss that that wouldn't be okay at all but once I started to share some of the stuff I learned through extensive research and how diets don't work long term, and then  I tell her how diets obviously didn't work for me and she goes, ""Well, you probably made the change too quickly""...I've thought about that comment for days, she said it as though she meant well but I can't accept that. I sent her an email confronting her about her comment but she said that we'll talk about it more on our next session. My ED thoughts still taunt me, they tell me that I'm doing something wrong and that I should be dieting and that I shouldn't be ""overweight"" and I just feel so alone and misunderstood.

TL;DR: My therapist and my mother are both diet culture nuts, but in two different ways, and it's making me feel terrible about the choices I've made for my physical and mental well-being since recovering from an ED. What should I do about all of this?

UPDATE \*3/29/21: I got to finally talk with my therapist about all of this and as it shockingly turns out...it was all a big misunderstanding. She's a telehealth therapist so she apparently didn't get to hear the part where I said that eating super ""healthy"" was a big part of my restrictive eating disorder and only suggested that I went into it ""too fast"" because she thought I was doing it for health reasons. She apologizes for the misunderstanding and informed me that she's against diet culture so she definitely didn't mean to come across in the way that she supports diets/diet culture. I'm so relieved about this, she even reminded me to listen to my body and I told her that is actually what I've been practicing and that it was called Intuitive Eating and she was happy to know that it had a name and actually wrote it down for research! :) Problem solved--except for mom but I don't care what that insecure hag has to say about me anymore.",1616556539.0

So I gave up dieting about a year ago. I read the book and reflected on the fact that I had spent all of my 20s on some kind of diet only to end up still chubby-just maybe very slightly less so.

So, I stopped. It wasn‚Äôt hard for me to stop restricting and as a result it didn‚Äôt take me very long to get to the chips-can-get-stale-in-pantry stage. I still over eat on occasion but I know that that is normal and ok too. It is not an every day thing. I eat a large and yummy salad for lunch most days because that is what I genuinely crave. I have joyful movement in my life.

As far as my habits go, I believe I am doing well! I honor my hunger and respect my fullness 90% of the time.

I am second guessing myself because I have gained weight and may still be gaining. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to say how much I weigh and I wouldn‚Äôt want to trigger anyone...just...trust me when I say I am definitely fat. I don‚Äôt think that is a dirty word, it is just a descriptor of my body. I **know** that I have better things to focus on than becoming smaller, I believe in HAES, I do think I‚Äôm healthy, I do think fat people should be allowed to exist and feel good about themselves.

I promised myself I would never go back to dieting. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense, really-I was devoting so much mental energy to be only slightly smaller than I am now-think like one clothing size.

After years of Binge Eating Disorder I finally gave up on diets. I grew tired of the back and forth and feelings of guilt when it came to eating.  So I decided I was going to follow my self and what I wanted. I truly believed that if I did I wouldn't gain weight, and I would eventually get to the point where my body was meant to be. 

So I started. I gave up on rationing, counting macros/micros and any other dieting technique I'd followed through the years. I went in on following my hunger/cravings to show me what I wanted to eat. 

After months of Intuitive Eating I discovered that half the time I wasn't craving food at all, but actually feeling my emotions. 

You see I had experienced eating disorders for so long that my body and mind had gotten used to eating whenever I felt emotions. 

For me--it was anxiety. Any time anxiety would come up it was my signal to eat sweets. So I would roam into the kitchen looking for something to satisfy my sweet tooth. But that anxiety? It never went away. It kept coming back until I recognized what was truly happening--I was masking my emotions with cravings. 

After I realized this I stopped myself from eating and instead sat to relax. If the emotion passed, I knew it wasn't a legit craving. 

When you are experiencing a craving for something ask yourself, ""Is this emotion, or an actual craving?"" If nothing comes to you, sit and relax for a couple of minutes. Give yourself space to notice what's happening. If it's a true craving you'll be able to sense subtle differences in how you feel. 

Give it a try. 

I‚Äôve included a podcast episode below where I go into more details on this topic. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

PSA: Things with fat taste better üòâ,73,lbpvdz,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/lbpvdz/psa_things_with_fat_taste_better/,23,"I‚Äôve been working on intuitive eating for several years now and consider myself mostly recovered from my disordered habits, but every once in awhile I notice diet culture thinking/behaviors that I haven‚Äôt let go of yet. This week, it was my habit of buying nonfat yogurt. One of my favorite breakfasts right now is some kind of Greek yogurt with granola. I just got myself some Chobani with 2% milk fat and...the difference is insane. Even as an intuitive eater, my brain was still programmed to buy the lower fat option because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done and that‚Äôs what society tells us is the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù option, but wow, I won‚Äôt be going back to the nonfat stuff anytime soon.

Just wanted to share this because I know when I was first starting out, challenging this type of thinking was really hard for me, and even now, having let go of tracking my food, and after getting to a good place with exercise, there are remnants of that disordered thinking in my head. It just goes to show how deeply ingrained diet culture is. If you‚Äôre still struggling with unlearning those rules: it‚Äôs a process! You‚Äôre doing great!

Oh, and buy the full-fat option. It always tastes better. üòú",1612365755.0
Bringing flavor back to my vegetables,12,lbut4y,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/lbut4y/bringing_flavor_back_to_my_vegetables/,3,"I was cooking a couple days ago and instead of just warming up in the microwave my frozen cauliflower and Brussel sprouts like I usually do, I decided to season and roast them with some oil in the oven. The flavor was amazing and reminded me of what I would eat at a restaurant. Why hadn‚Äôt I done this before?! And then I realized some things:

- I think roasting vegetables is not as healthy as just warming them up in the microwave. 
- I think adding oil and seasoning to them will reduce the nutritional value.
- This is a treat not because it takes longer to make but because it‚Äôs not as healthy as bland vegetables.

When I was in high school, my mom started cooking with practically no seasoning in her food to reduce sodium and drastically reduce oil usage for health reasons. She used a lot of yummy nutritious ingredients, so it still tasted delicious to me, but it was missing that punch of flavor. 

Holy cow. I subconsciously had diet culture in my freaking VEGGIES! I‚Äôm glad I stopped to take the time and realize what I was subconsciously thinking and doing. Now I season them all the time regardless of how I cook them and it tastes great. I can‚Äôt believe I was demonizing **flavor** for so long. Happy that is over with!",1612377884.0

Why do all (most) nutrition apps need to be about weight loss?,29,l74drf,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/l74drf/why_do_all_most_nutrition_apps_need_to_be_about/,12,"These past few months this whole concept started bugging me. With Covid and lockdown happening, everyone's day to day lives has been impacted with major changes in all sort of aspects. We were forced to change our routines, stay away from friends and family, and our usual distractions were taken away from us - whether it was going to the pub with friends, the theatre, a cinema, art class, a run - whatever that was, we just could not do it anymore.

It's unsurprising that with a lack of outside, tangible distractions, in this day of technology, people resorted to online mediums - myself included. And next thing I realised, is this surge in fitness content that seemed to appear from everywhere, and *anyone* telling you what you should do to be healthy, and what you should eat to maintain a healthy lifestyle, how to not put up those kilos. For me, this caused actions that I now realised were all *but* healthy. And it therefore also does not come to a surprise these times were also characterised by a sudden surge in calls to mental health and eating disorders helplines. Is there a way to help?

There are a lot of (thankfully) good mental health apps around - Calm, Headspace and Sanvello just to name a couple - but when I started to looking into nutrition, I could not say the same - or at least, not in what I was looking for. Eating disorders are unfortunately a very complicated problem - that goes beyond my confidence in saying that this can be tackled completely through a digitised solution. But what about preventative solutions? What about disordered eating - what about those unhealthy food relationships that are still, hopefully, at a non dangerous stage? **Why does there not seem to be anything that wants to help teach someone about nutrition, and help them regain confidence around food and happiness around food? Why does there not seem to be anything that tries and heal the relationship between a person and food?**

Of the nutrition apps I have found while doing my research, I want to remove all the *calorie counting*apps. I am against them and I really think it's the wrong approach to nutrition. I think (at least from my personal level) that this can be one of the biggest ways to develop bad food relationship. It can become so easy to associate a low number with good, and a high number with bad - and this approach is *far away from healthy.* And also going through MyFitnessPal subreddits, I can confidently say that I am not the only one who thinks this.

On the other hand, I would like to highlight some apps I was not aware of, but which positively surprised me: Noom and Second Nature. What I liked about both is that they:

* aim at creating a *personalised* diet
* remove counting calories (although Noom associated colours to foods - green, yellow and red - and this could on itself be seen as good, meh and bad)
* have access to 1:1 coaches and chat group to support someone's journey (in the case of Second Nature they are registered dieticians and nutritionists. The fact that they are *registered* is to me an extra point towards them)

Furthermore, Second Nature also allows for:

* education of nutrition science
* in app journaling
* tracking sleep

And both of them try and push for a *behavioural change* within the individual. Which is a good and sustainable approach. **HOWEVER** they both tackle **weight loss**. In both cases the target is to help someone lose weight. And although this can be a path to increase someone's health for diseases such as diabetes and possibly other health related issues, **I think that branding weight loss as a goal is wrong.**

***Why do nutrition apps always need to be about weight loss?*** I have failed to find a solution that brings together nutrition and mindfulness, helping someone regain happiness around food, learning to appreciate it again - and because I have failed to find it, **it is something I am working on creating**. And I would like to ask you, what would be the best features you would like to have.

These are some I am envisioning right now:

* Assign a 1:1 coach - a registered dietician or nutritionist
* Mood diary and log - mood diary associated to foods eaten during the day, and just overall mood
* set yourself daily/weekly/monthly challenges - e.g. not weighing yourself for a week/month, eating that trigger food. Asking to reflect on your actions
* CBT inspired exercises

I would value any of your opinions!! These could be features you think would be useful, overall opinion if you would use anything solution of the sort, any professional I could contact etc

Intuitive Eating as a gateway to intuitive living!,89,l0tncp,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/l0tncp/intuitive_eating_as_a_gateway_to_intuitive_living/,12,"I was in a therapy session recently and talking to me therapist about why I don't do the things that are 'good' for me, even when I know they make me happy. In fact, I told her I have a list of good and bad ways I spend my time. Good = yoga, meditation, making art, spending time with friends, etc. Bad = social media, Netflix, not getting exercise, the usual suspects.

And as I was describing it to her, it dawned on me: I think about activities in the same way I used to think about food, before IE. There were good and bad foods, and I could be really 'good' for a set amount of time before I'd rebound and binge on all my 'bad' foods, rinse and repeat.

My way to break that cycle with food was to learn intuitive learning and learn how to remove moral value from food and really tune into my body and its needs. I learned that sometimes my body will want chips and chocolate and sometimes it will want salad and oatmeal. And the more I listen to my body, the more I crave things that make me feel good, full, happy, and satiated.

Why shouldn't this also apply to the rest of my life? Now that I have practice tuning into myself for food, why not do the same for movement and nourishment of my soul?

I found it amazing that, once I tuned into my body for things other than food, I noticed things like: I am a little too cold; I am thirsty; I want to dance while waiting for the kettle to boil; I want some fresh air; I need to lay down for a bit; etc.

I have always struggled to get in a regular exercise routine, but I am curious to see what a bit more body awareness and tuning in will bring into my life. I have always approached exercise intellectually-- putting myself on a schedule with activities that seem useful. I'm going to try approaching it physically-- what does my body really want right now? Rest? Vigour? Dance? Stretching? Play?  


I'm thinking of setting aside just 10 minutes each day to tune into my body and see what it wants. If it wants to stretch, I'll stretch. If it wants to run, dance, or do some burpees, I'll do that. If it wants to lay on the couch and just rest, I'll do that. I think my fear is the same fear I had when I stopped dieting and gave myself full permission to eat: 'If I do that, I'll eat chips forever and never want healthy food.' It definitely wasn't true for food, so I can imagine it won't be true for my body's other needs, too.

Same for the soul. With my soul's 10 minutes, I might choose to draw or write; I might choose to call a friend; I might choose to flop on the couch and play a mobile game or mindlessly scroll instagram to escape my life for a bit. I might choose any of the above, but that choice will be better than either trying to force something 'wholesome' or just mindlessly distracting myself to avoid making any choice.

IE is such a great entryway toward better general self-knowledge and wisdom!",1611091497.0

True health or Diet Culture? Curious about my weight.,19,kqfa84,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/kqfa84/true_health_or_diet_culture_curious_about_my/,9,"I have been on medication that is known to cause weight gain for about 6 months. I've been doing IE since November 2019. I gained weight during IE and I'm totally back to my set point range. I have noticed I've gained some weight since starting this med although I dont weigh myself at all. I can feel it on my body. I also turn away from the scale at the doctor. Only time I see my weight is when I get my doctor visit summary because it's plastered at the top unfortunately. 

Last time I went to the doc I saw I had gained x lbs and I guess it was mildly triggering for me because now I'm wondering if this medication has made me gain weight as I have weird appetite (binging some days and then eating very little or forcing myself to eat the next day because my appetite is averted to food). Being on this medication has been pretty good for me otherwise. I dont know. 

I can just hear that sad pathetic societally influenced fatphobic devil on my shoulder saying I should care. But realistically I don't want to get off the drug because I'm not ready to overhaul my medication regimen at this stage in my life as this one is finally beginning to work.

I've even thought about asking for a pill to counter balance the pill that causes weight gain (like metformim or something) because I have a VERY pervasive family history of diabetes, and I already show symptoms like excessive urination and thirst. I've also been to an endocrinologist regarding this and he had suggested the metformin pill to help regulate my hormones for my mild PCOS and diabetes prevention. He gave this advice in no relation to my other medication at all (he also suggested weight loss and low carb diets for someone who is literally in the middle of the BMI scale that doctors ""rank"" us by---but that is beside the point). I already have several life long medical issues going on and I don't want to add diabetes to the list.

Interesting Christmas,19,knxe8t,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/knxe8t/interesting_christmas/,2,"I've been actively practicing Intuitive Eating for 10 months now, so this Christmas was my first not having to worry about food. It was also my first year truly noticing my family's obsession with food, specifically my mom and older sister. Food came up in almost every single conversation, mentions of needing to diet after the holidays, and comments about needing to exercise, etc. Me and my family are very close, so when I visit, we have most meals together. My mom had planned all of our meals out for dinners while I was visiting, which is normal for her, as she's a planner. But this was the first year I noticed kind of an obsession around it. If we were having some sort of carb with a meal, she or my sister would want to skip it or they would complain about it. My mom would tell us if she had a Christmas cookie for breakfast, almost in a self-defeating way so that we would criticize her, I guess? It's almost as if the special Christmas meals just couldn't even be enjoyed in the moment. And I just found myself constantly having to brush their comments aside and literally separate myself from it all. I would tell myself that I am not them, I am not in that current struggle, and food does not hold meaning or morality for me anymore. It's just a meal. It took a lot of self control and self awareness to get through. But boy did it annoy me because it just happened All. The. Time. 

All this to say, goodness this journey has been a struggle so far. Ups and downs, wanting to go back to dieting a million times, all of it. But one of the best parts of it (and to me, the benefits far out-weigh the struggles, on top of it all just making sense) is no longer having food take up so much brain space. I absolutely still enjoy food, but mostly it's just another thing of life, and it's useful for my body. There's no more shame, obsession, fear (for the most part). And that's what I hear in my family member's words when they talk like that. I so long for them to find freedom like I have. And all I can do is just not give in to the diet talk, ignore the comments, and live my life authentically free. 

I think what breaks my heart the most is that my mom has actually made comments to me, sounding like she believes in this freedom I have found... For ME. But she won't allow it for herself. I can only hope one day she does. Because man, the never-ending relentless struggle to keep up with society's standards just isn't worth it. There's so much more to life. But one thing I know--we have to have grace for people. Because behind their diet talk is most likely a lot of shame, doubt, insecurity, and fear.

I allowed myself to eat and just ... wow!,35,k5kvfr,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/k5kvfr/i_allowed_myself_to_eat_and_just_wow/,2,"I'm fairly new to intuitive eating. I've come to it after a long history of bulimia, which turned into binge eating disorder, and an accompanying depression which, like for lots of people, has been particularly bad this year.    During lockdown I've ended up working from home permanently and my routine has gone to pieces. I've stayed in bed until the last moment before logging on to work, so of course no time for breakfast, and not having to get out of the house or take breaks at certain times meant I just stopped eating during the day. I've been incredibly tired during the day and I've been so unproductive. This cycled into feeling I didn't deserve to eat until I'd got enough work done. Which I now realize of course was why I wasn't getting any work done - I had no fuel in my body! Can't expect a car to drive without petrol so why would my brain be able to think without adequate nutrition?!

This realization hit me this evening. Yesterday I ate a bowl of cereal in the evening. No other food all day. Today by supper time I was RAVENOUS. Like, could have taken a bite out of the table hungry. I was faint and shaking. But I made a simple dinner of my fave veggie burger and salad. That was great, but after eating it I was still hungry. Normally I would have said that I'd had dinner so no more food. Well I listened to what the book says - I fancied more savoury food so I whipped up some veggie chicken nuggets and ate them with a bit more salad. 30 mins later I was still getting hunger signals so I ate a pain au chocolate and a bit of ice cream. Normally I'd be freaking out about eating so much, but then my housemate looked at me and said ""Good, you need to eat, you must be starving after yesterday"". Oh. My. God. Who would have thought that such a simple bit of validation of my totally natural hunger feelings would help me have such a realization!! I'm pleasantly full, I've had foods I love tonight. And I'm so so happy and content. I feel at peace. 

I know it's only the start of this journey but I hope I can remember this feeling when it gets tough.",1606950655.0

Question about weight gain,10,k5iszu,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/k5iszu/question_about_weight_gain/,15,"Please let me know if I‚Äôm breaking any rules with this! 

So I‚Äôve been eating intuitively since around April, (working towards it for probably a year before), and I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight (I don‚Äôt weigh myself, but had to throw out my whole closet and start over). I‚Äôm working on being ok with it and feel pretty comfortable in my skin. 

I found a thread a while back about when I‚Äôm feeling like nothing fits right and I‚Äôm upset about my body that I should do something that does make me feel good and proud of my body so I‚Äôve been doing a lot of yoga which has been awesome. It‚Äôs an adjustment because my body doesn‚Äôt do certain things anymore, but I‚Äôm ok with that too.

HOWEVER, I am struggling with something- my legs in particular feel.... swollen? Like if I sit on my knees it feels like my calves might burst open. My skin feels tight. Even sitting cross cross feels this way. Is this a normal part of weight gain or is this a sign of something else- water retention or something? I do have hypothyroidism so it‚Äôs hard to distinguish between symptoms from that and just normally weight gain stuff. 

Does anyone else relate to this? Is there anything that helps? Or is it just something I need to get used to? Thanks in advance.

My weight went up and up and up since I stopped purging with periodic dips, and this summer I hit the highest weight I‚Äôve ever hit. 

I‚Äôm in the middle of reading the book, and today was the first day I really tried to just let go. Even though I was eating a lot of food I felt physically more hungry today than I have in a really long time and it has me feeling confused. Like my stomach has felt more physical hunger pangs and I can‚Äôt really figure out why. 

Even though I do often restrict, my restriction is never extreme. There are plenty of days where I‚Äôve eaten what feels like similar amounts as today. There are plenty of days where I‚Äôve eaten less and not felt this physically hungry, and more when I‚Äôve not felt this physically hungry. And it has me panicking. While there were times it felt really good to just be eating full meals without any guilt or thoughts of future restriction in my head, the physical hunger that won‚Äôt seemed to be popping up even though I feel like my body would normally feel very good and satiated  and satisfied at this level has making me feeling very confused and panicked. I ate what felt like a very solid day of food where I ate lots of foods I love and that should have me feeling full. I‚Äôm not craving anything, nothing sounds particularly good, I don‚Äôt feel like my body is asking for something specific, I don‚Äôt even really have an appetite. 

Is this a normal experience? is it possibly partly because I‚Äôm on the 2nd day of my period? I don‚Äôt think I normally feel this hungry on my period but I don‚Äôt know. It made me just want to quit because I feel like just the change in mindset somehow changed my hunger ques and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seriously accepted the fact that I may continue to gain weight when I‚Äôm already so much bigger than I used to be. I so much want to let go of the fear and heal my relationship with my body and with food but I‚Äôm mentally stuck and this physical hunger has me feeling like I just took a whole bunch of steps backwards in this process.

Also, I hope this post will be understandable, and forgive me as English is not my native language.
  
How to deal with unlimited food on social gatherings? What I mean by that is: usually in the case of preparing the food myself or even ordering it, there's a limit to portion size, and I can be satisfied within that. But when there's a social event (maybe not exactly nowadays, ya know), and the host has prepared a variety of different dishes to choose from, I get this urge to have and taste everything. That's because everything is appealing to me, and, you know, I'm used think this is the only chance in a longer while that I get to have some more of the unusual tasty food than on a day-to-day basis. And in the end it's not all that pleasant, because I keep focussing on food and get overly stuffed. By now I get that it would be better to choose  just some of the foods that are available and have them mindfully, but I feel that my thinking would still be revolving around food instead of what the social events are for.

I've been doing IE for four years, and that was the first time I felt a really strong trust like that. I think I really screwed up my trust with the way I dieted. Most dieters apparently disconnect from their bodies' needs; I kept in touch with my cravings in order to better manipulate them.

I am NOT trying to guilt people.

This is me trying to work through some difficulties that I have with the IE movement as a relatively recent resident of Canada. 

Anyway, my main point of contention (or kind of) is that IE is highly individualistic. This is not a problem ‚Äî esp. in recovery ‚Äî but I do feel that it encourages consumption that does not take into account larger processes and mechanisms of food production? 

And please ... please do not trot out trite replies like, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no ethical consumption under capitalism,‚Äù because /there/ is a role that western consumers play in the continued subjugation of labour in the global south and there is agency there. This is not to say we all get bogged down in guilt ‚Äî abolitionists wore clothes made by slaves while fighting for abolition. That doesn‚Äôt invalidate their point or their efforts to get rid of an awful system. But, I‚Äôm not really doing that. Most of us aren‚Äôt. 

However ... I guess, I‚Äôm thinking of things like cashews, or coffee (which I know seems horrendously essential), or chocolate. The little treats. When most of the supply comes from labour that is so exploited so as to bring actual tears to my eyes, how can I justify mindlessly buying things (and tbh Fair Trade is problematic as well) because they satisfy ME? 

[It doesn‚Äôt mean that my actual behaviour is different either. I do buy hot chocolate once in a while too.]

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering how to square with the kind of lifestyle a lot of IE followers tend to lead: with lots of snacks, lots of variety, etc. Which is fine, because ... same. 

So yeah, to repeat myself: I‚Äôm concerned about how IE is framed as the most natural way of eating in a culture filled with highly palatable, engineered, and MARKETED food (and drink) that uses resources and labour that do not need to be exploited (and frankly, couldn‚Äôt exist without exploitation. See: Coca Cola) 

An economic and cultural landscape where the implications of  ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù consumption means consumption divorced from /accountability/ for fear of re-introducing guilt. I don‚Äôt know how I can justify eating without at least Some Guilt at Some Point (I‚Äôm not crying every time I drink a coke lol). And this isn‚Äôt a distant problem for me. The cashew processing plants that are in the news for the awful working conditions are close to my hometown. 

I Am Not Saying That You Guys Should Feel Bad. Especially for those in food deserts or in poverty (and EDs, etc.) although in my opinion those conditions likely limit your ability to truly eat intuitively. 

I guess I‚Äôm saying that I do. Feel bad, that is. And I don‚Äôt know where to go from here.",1605805147.0

In some ways I'm doing well with IE but I feel like I'm struggling right now. I started letting go of food rules early this past summer but only fully committed to IE about two months ago. Also, I'd like to note that I've had a few psychiatric diagnoses over the years including depression, anxiety, and anorexia nervosa, and I suspect I may be on the autism spectrum, which is relevant here because of sensory/texture issues ..

It's simultaneously overwhelming and exciting going from being able to eat \~30% of what is available in the grocery store (due to wellness culture influenced restrictions i.e. refined carbs & sugar, gluten, dairy) to 100%. My boyfriend is really happy that I've let go of my food rules and grocery shopping is definitely a lot more fun these days; we've been trying lots of different things. But it's also overwhelming having full cupboards and wanting a really fulfilling eating experience and feeling indecisive about what to have. I feel like I need more ""go to"" meals, especially for breakfast, so there's not so much guesswork every time, because that causes a lot of anxiety. But lately I've noticed a lot of textural sensitivities to foods so there aren't actually that many options, despite having very well stocked cupboard and fridge? I find most kinds of breads too abrasive to my mouth, which cuts out a lot of options, and is a bit disappointing since I just started allowing bread a few months ago after years of avoiding it .. my boyfriend's go to breakfast is an extremely crunchy (to me, abrasive) type of open face sandwich that is typical in Sweden, where he comes from, and I wish I could have that with him, but it feels too abrasive. So I think of softer things like porridge made with oats or quinoa, or cereal, or yogurt and honey, but those kinds of these that go in bowls make me anxious because of the imprecision of the components .. without a measuring cup, how do I know how much milk, cereal, yogurt etcetera to put in? I guess I haven't learned yet to trust my body in how much is enough - I'm not worrying so much about calories, though, it's more the imprecision of those breakfast options that bothers me.

Never Feel Bad About Eating Through Anxiety---BUT Learn From It,26,jsy2v2,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/jsy2v2/never_feel_bad_about_eating_through_anxietybut/,10,"There's a lot of talk about not restricting yourself from eating, even if it is emotional. There's truth to this, but only to a point.  

Let me explain. 

For the brand new intuitive eater--eating through emotions are going to be a regular thing. You're not going to be able to tell what you're feeling. Is it hunger? Is it want? Is it emotion you're pushing away?

Eating through it (if that's what you're called to do)  is going to be absolutely necessary in order to release the hold food has on you. 

**One can not let go of the diet foundation if they don't embrace food freedom wholeheartedly.**

Now, for the seasoned intuitive eater, restriction is going to be absolutely necessary in order to heal those emotional eating habits. **Eating out of anxiety is a learned response to life** (especially for the disordered eater). 

I would argue that even stress eating is learned, and must be challenged in order to overcome it. 

**If you're finding yourself at a place where you understand that feeding self is ok, that food is not to be feared and you're paying attention to your pulls to eat-**\-then go ahead and restrict as a way of figuring out if what you're feeling is emotion or hunger. And I say that ONLY if you have to question it. 

**Anxiety is uncomfortable. It feels more like, ""I have to get food to feel better!""**

Hunger/Want is a comfortable feeling. It's embracing. ""Food sounds good right now. Chocolate sounds good. Fries sound good. Salad sounds good. I'm going to eat something."" 

It can even be, ""OMG I'm Starving! I need to eat!"" 

or

Last night, I ate dinner, and the head hunger started really badly. I couldn't sleep it was so terrible. That hideous buzzing in my brain of an insect colony demanding more food. But it wasn't physical hunger, not the same, and I refused to indulge in it this time. It was miserable, miserable, and it finally faded after a time.

I don't know what causes this; I can't tell if it's a binge urge, my body asking for more nutrition, or what. It's not a specific craving for one food or another, it's a drive to consume more food in general.

This community has changed my life.,42,jry3a8,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/jry3a8/this_community_has_changed_my_life/,2,"I have actually barely posted, more of a ghost kinda person. However. I first found this sub 11 months ago and prior to that I had been recovering from an eating disorder for many years. I was eating regularly and had been steadily gaining weight over years into being quite overweight. I knew I needed to do something but was getting more and more terrified of trying to do anything because I couldn't seem to deal with food ""normally"".

I had gone through numerous phases to try and lose weight as I knew I was getting more and more unhealthy but all of them followed the same pattern dieting always used to be for me. Obsess about it like crazy, do it 120% for up to 3 months, crash and burn because I was not really looking after myself, put on all the weight I previously lost. End up depressed and feeling like I had no self control and was a total failure. Its like despite the fact I could now eat and I was nowhere near as bad as I had been I still was being ruled by food.

So I started searching for what I could do and ways to manage weight without going on a diet. Honestly I really struggled to find much as so much guidance, even national health service etc seems to be an eat this, don't eat that kinda situation. And that was not helping me. 

And I found here. I have not actually read the whole book (sorry) I have read parts but I mainly read a lot of articles and posts on here. I found other people who were terrified of leaving diets behind but also knew that these diets had become the problem. And other people who understood my fear around food, but also the balance of wanting to be healthy.

In the last 11 months I have been working steadily on my relationship with food. How I don't need to be afraid of it, that it helps my body and I need it. I enjoy how it tastes and eating something sweet because you had a bad day isn't some kind of cardinal sin! How some days I do struggle with how I feel with food, but that doesn't mean I am failing or something. Realising that my issues were not my will power or strength or something. But that the way I was living was not sustainable and what I needed to change was how I viewed food, not restricting what I ate or counting calories.  


Anyway I need to go to bed and this post has been long. but TLDR: reading everyones posts and seeing everyones go through a similar experience to me has encouraged me a lot on my own journey. I am building a much better relationship with food and thankful to you all for it :).",1605056891.0
Food colors affect my enjoyment,6,jrryz1,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/jrryz1/food_colors_affect_my_enjoyment/,2,"Hey ya'll. I posted earlier about how I'd been gaining weight for a long time (4 years), and was starting to question if I was doing something wrong. Someone suggested I should eat more things that give me pleasure instead of the stuff I crave. I decided to do that.

Previously, I was eating large amounts of meat and dairy--as much as I could afford. My body was demanding it, so I ate it. But what I enjoy (for now) seems to be mostly fruit, vegetables, starch, and sugar, with some dairy. Now I'm a little worried I'm gonna lose too much weight and have super loose skin. At least I'm getting some vitamins.

But that's not my question, just an update. What I'm noticing, now that I'm eating more plants, is that I have a pretty strong preference for green colored foods, and for cool-colored foods in general. I often feel displeasure from eating warm-colored foods such as carrots and tomatoes.

I'm not sure if that's something I should try to ignore. I have a visual sensitivity to color; warm colors have bothered me for a long time. I don't like to look at red things, lol. So I'm not sure if this is a body need.

What should I do? Will avoiding red and orange foods make me sick? I know I will end up eating them sometimes. I can handle yellow better, also.

I forgot to mention, sometimes brownish foods are unappetizing to me as well.",1605037460.0

Been on this intuitive eating journey for a long time now and I'm feeling very healthy. I still have slip-ups when I'm stressed or something traumatic happens, but generally, I am in a good groove where I feel like I have a balance. I eat for fuel and also for pleasure. I love making food and eating it both alone and with friends and family. I exercise a lot which has been the secret to having a good relationship with food and WANTING to make healthy choices which fuel my body.  

However, one thing I notice is whenever I eat sugar I backtrack. Not like, one small chocolate, I do eat candy and cake if I'm at a party or similar, but if I stay a weekend at my parents' place and eat candy one night, then eat pancakes with sugar for breakfast and dessert again, I fall into a negative spiral. I crave sugar again and I feel completely out of control and out of tune with myself. I crave sugar over everything else and I feel more sluggish causing me to avoid exercise which I typically love, and then i just want to eat more sugar. Every time this has happened I have had to force myself to stop eating sugar and after a few weeks, I am back to normal where I don't crave sugar. This doesn't happen if i eat sugarfree candy and artificial sweeteners. 

I am a type 1 diabetic, not sure if it's related to this as I have never eaten much sugar growing up and I'm used to artificial sweeteners in my everyday life. Sugar also makes it hard to regulate my blood sugar which in turn makes me feel worse overall.

What I'm asking is if it is unhealthy to avoid and have slight anxiety over sugar for these reasons. In a way, I feel like it's similar to have I have anxiety over foods I'm allergic to, but I'm not sure. I would like to be able to eat sugar like a normal person, but I feel very quickly dependent on it. I feel addicted.

I've never made a Reddit post before, so I don't know what I'm doing. I apologize if I breach etiquette. I figure I should add one of those labels (flair?) to this post, but I don't see where the button is.

I started doing IE about 4 years ago. I've been incredibly hungry ever since. I've gained enough weight that it's getting hard to stand up.

 I was a very, very aggressive dieter. I kept off a large amount of weight for many years, then gained PART of it back, then lost it again for several more years. I suspect that's not a common story. I really pushed myself hard as hell with my diet, and I've been telling myself this 4-year binge is the payback.

But I am also wondering more and more if it's even possible for me to reach homeostasis. See, I'm on an antipsychotic medication. These meds commonly cause large weight gain.

In addition to the hunger, I have profound fatigue and weakness. I can't really do much. The fatigue and weakness intuitively feel connected to the hunger, and they've improved as I've gotten larger. But I also have fatigue because of other illnesses. I also have severe rage problems that seem ""hangry.""

This hunger is ruining my life, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. The med I'm taking is non-negotiable. Can't be changed. My doctors and parents are opposed to IE and will not give me any support besides diet stuff. I cannot afford any other doctors.

I still feel like my body is not done rebuilding, but I'm not sure if I'm fooling myself. I crave LOTS of protein, but also plenty of fat and sugar.

What do ya'll think I should do? Disclaimer: I only take advice if it REALLY makes sense to me, and I'm leaning heavily towards eating until I either die or get better, lol.

Keep going!‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou can look even better!‚Äù...And somehow my thoughts become ‚Äúif you keep eating whatever you want you‚Äôll start gaining weight and looking worse‚Äù or ‚Äúyou need to make sure you don‚Äôt gain much more weight if you want to keep liking how you look.‚Äù The funny thing is that I‚Äôve been doing intuitive eating for a little while now.

Then when things got somewhat back to normal I decided to commit to intuitive eating since I was already kind of doing it. I read the Fuck It Diet and it inspired me even more. Throughout all this time I‚Äôve gained weight but then at some point I decided to stop looking at the scale and I haven‚Äôt since then. So my latest thoughts and feeling good about how I look have been solely based on doing mental exercises like positive affirmations and internally giving myself compliments.

Emotional eating,13,jjvwfh,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/jjvwfh/emotional_eating/,13,"Hi guys, 

I was wondering what you do in moments of stress and anxiety? Or whatever other emotions that cause emotional eating. I‚Äôve been working on processing my feelings and really letting myself feel them. I‚Äôve even had moments where I very clearly could separate my feelings and wanting food.

I know it‚Äôs not a disorder or anything but my emotions can get pretty intense (quite frequently) and I often feel physical effects like headaches. I guess in those moments when you can‚Äôt turn to food, what do you do? My other go to is television because it can be such a distraction.

Two of the more common side effects are nausea and a feeling of fullness. I don't think about or crave food nearly as much as I used to, and I don't always notice when I'm hungry. Not until all of a sudden my stomach is burning and my blood sugar drops. But even that just makes me feel nauseated. 

I've been trying to think of some snacks to keep around, something easy on the stomach and inoffensive. I got some yogurt, but when I get that burning stomach feeling, yogurt just makes it worse. It's the Oikos with stevia, because sugar also makes it worse (and aspartame gives me a headache). Raw veggies have always made my stomach hurt, and the thought of meat makes me feel really ill.

The TLDR of my previous post is I work as a nanny/zoom school helper for a kindergartener in his home from 8am-12(occasionally until 2pm) M-F.  I was having an issue eating intuitively dealing with the child‚Äôs schedule, and having him want to PLAY rather than have a snack on the one break long enough to make something from his Zoom classes.

I was given the great advice to use smoothies/shakes as a way to curb the ‚Äúhangries‚Äù, and at first this worked really well, but now....I just don‚Äôt feel satisfied or satiated by the shakes.  This leaves me feeling hungry again about an hour after I finish the shake, and then I am back to square one with my intuitive eating problem, except I have piled-on the feeling of a lack of satisfaction in eating by consuming a smoothie because it is all I have time for, not because I genuinely wanted to drink it. 

I want to add that I have a bad history with Shakes or smoothies anyway because they were my go-to ‚Äúdiet food‚Äù when I was deep in my diet-culture, and orthorexia days. 

I figured using them in this new light of keeping myself fueled and away from hunger would be a great way to ‚Äúreclaim the smoothie‚Äù for myself, but it isn‚Äôt working now.  It isn‚Äôt even that I dislike the smoothie: it just has been habituated already, and isn‚Äôt what I INTUITIVELY WANT to eat right now.  

I feel like I need to switch up what I eat in order to make the shake fulfilling again when I do decide to make it. 

Unfortunately, this schedule doesn‚Äôt actually ALLOW me the comfort of having the time to make what I would actually want to eat as I am caring for a child who often times doesn‚Äôt take enough time to eat his own lunch, and wants to get in some play-time before his next class. I am lucky to grab a small handful of blueberries, or some cheese &amp; crackers that the family has on-hand to snack on after I make him his lunch. It makes a great in-between snack, but doesn‚Äôt solve my problem of what to ‚Äúeat‚Äù between 8am and 11:15 am :(. 

I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Is there any kind of protein bar, or quick-grab snacks people like that I could purchase, and just take with me?

All of my college classes this semester are on Zoom and back to back. I barely have time to make a snack much less prepare exactly what my body wants between classes. I end up eating a snack that I don't necessarily want as I race back to my computer to join the Zoom for my next class, and this just stresses me out. I get super anxious about eating too much or too little because I don't have time to make a satisfying snack or meal. Any tips or suggestions on how to manage this? I would appreciate any bits of advice or any snacks/meals that y'all enjoy if you share similar schedules etc.! Thank you!",1601338095.0
New job has made my intuitive eating more difficult,18,j06ijm,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/j06ijm/new_job_has_made_my_intuitive_eating_more/,7,"I have had great success on my intuitive eating journey the past 9 months. At the start of the pandemic: like many people I found myself underemployed for 3 months. I used that time to do a deep dive into intuitive eating, re-read the book, and felt on the right path!

Well, I started a new part time job as an in-home nanny/school help aid for a Kindergartener.  Since many schools are doing zoom classes; I basically have to help the Kindergartner learn via zoom( lesson in futility....). The family is great, I really enjoy the work. It is challenging, but feels rewarding.  

My issue is getting the CHANCE to eat. I am basically busy with no opportunities to have a snack unless the child wants a snack on the break also. I make sure to eat before I get there, but I am not that hungry when I first start my day, so I usually end up ravenous just before my shift is up, and again...There really isn‚Äôt time for me to fix a snack if the child doesn‚Äôt want one. 

Occasionally I have a literal quick second to grab a handful of something on a break, but it‚Äôs challenging, and the snack I grab is never something I really intuitively want, it‚Äôs what I can reasonably grab in a second before I have to get the child back into class. 

This has left me waiting past my hunger until I am off my shift and then I feel like I am SO hungry that I start to make quick, poor, and less satisfying food decisions because it is all I can get my hands on. 

I think I also have an added ‚Äúinternal pressure‚Äù because the parents are home while I do this.  

I know they 100 percent support me having snacks, it‚Äôs that finding the time for me to MAKE the snack is difficult.  Like, I intuitively would love to slice up some of the fruit they have and pair it with some cheese or peanut butter, but most days I only have time to grab the crackers because the child wants to play during the break, not eat.  

If anyone has any tips I am open...I just find this more challenging than before.

###**UPDATE**### 
Thank you to the suggestion of smoothies/Shakes! Despite my resistance because of always using protein shakes as diet aids in the past I have been hesitant to include them, but having making a protein shake in a water bottle I take with me has literally saved my life! 

I make a shake with some chocolate protein powder, a banana, coffee, and some milk: It was both the caffeine boost I needed and gave me some needed energy to make it through my shift!",1601128806.0
6(ish) months of progress!,32,ix9f03,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ix9f03/6ish_months_of_progress/,0,"I'm almost coming up to 6 months of intuitive eating and wanted to share some reflections on my progress and future goals! I also want to say whilst there is a lot to celebrate here it has been a bumpy road. There's been times I've been knocked off course but I remembered that I'm on a 'spiral of healing' and managed to avoid guilty tripping myself and refocused on the IE principles. 

My successes: 
- Challenging the food police! I now eat what I want, when I want, without guilt. 
- Joyful movement. For the first time in my life I'm moving my body without anxiety or pressure because I'm doing it for the way I feel rather than how I want to look. 
- Gentle nutrition. I'm eating a balanced diet, lots of fruits and veggies, wholegrains etc with a good  balance of play food.
- No more bingeing! I cant remember the last time I had a binge episode or I ate secretly.

My goals going fowards:
- Feeling my fullness. I am a huge foodie and sometimes I'm enjoying a meal so much I just don't want to stop. I also have a very busy lifestyle and sometimes overeat without thinking. Eating mindfully is something I really want to conquer.
- Coping with my emotions without food. There are still some days when I've had a hard time where I reach for comfort food (or sometimes even alcohol). In the last few weeks though I've discovered yoga (something that oddly used to always make me anxious) as a way to slow my mind and body down. I'm confident I can use this and build other ways of coping without emotionally eating going forwards!

Random things I have noticed recently (about my body signals and IE),28,ityji4,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ityji4/random_things_i_have_noticed_recently_about_my/,8,"Nothing life-changing here or really anything new, but I have been trying to work on my mindfulness a lot more, so new discoveries have come up.

1. **My biggest sign that I am getting close to satisfaction is when food starts tasting different.** This took me a while, because I thought it was a weird fluke. I have no idea why, but when I'm close to being full, I kind of lose interest, start playing with my food, then it honestly tastes completely different.
2. **I am very easily triggered by other people's lifestyle choices.** Not just dieting to lose weight or anything like that, but literally everything. This was a BIG problem in my dieting days. I would see one person go vegan, so I would try vegan. Then 3 days later, someone posted about Keto, so I would need to do Keto. Over and over again. Even though I don't diet anymore and try really hard not to follow anyone who does, sometimes it throws you for a loop. This happened to me yesterday when Lizzo posted a body picture, and everyone in the comments talked about how she went Vegan a month ago. For animal reasons, not diet reasons, but still. My mind immediately went ""hmm maybe I should look into it"". UGH. Like I said, even when it's not about restrictions or weight loss or anything remotely close to it, my mind still goes there for like a second before I catch myself. 
3. **I have no idea what to do with myself.** I was definitely a boredom eater. I knew i was an emotional eater, but I didn't realize how often I would eat just because I was bored. Now that I don't do it (as often) and food isn't completely taking over my life, I realize how much free time I have. I see how I used to just eat a snack because I wasn't sure what to do with myself. I guess I need some hobbies :/

One thing I am really struggling with is in relation to joyful movement. I really like being active, and I feel my best when doing so! Over the years I have really enjoyed dancing, horse riding, cycling, and lately, I have been enjoying the hiking trails near my home. 

One of the things I used to really enjoy about these activities is meeting other people while doing them. With COVID-19, I haven‚Äôt been getting out much and have been browsing online communities more. Unfortunately, that means I have been exposed to a lot more diet talk than I would like. These communities have been great for new ideas, preventing injuries, developing skill etc, and I love the passion shown by members. However, whenever I accidentally come across a topic that focuses on food and restriction, I feel like it really gets to me and almost sets me back. I have been finding myself fearful of restriction again, and not wanting to engage in activities. I know I should probably cut these out, I just miss being able to engage in excitement about my activities with others.

Food intolerances (specifically lactose),8,iqepew,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/iqepew/food_intolerances_specifically_lactose/,18,"Earlier this year, I began to suspect I had developed some level of lactose intolerance.  Over this summer, I've increasingly thought that yeah, milk and maybe dairy generally is a problem.  A couple of weeks ago I found myself doubled up on the bed with painful gas and passing some seriously TOXIC farts and decided okay, I need to try cutting out dairy just to see what happens because this sucks!!!  My husband said he wanted to stop drinking milk as he thought it was causing him some stomach upset also, so...no more milk.

Giving up milk is not really a big problem.  I use it in tea but it turns out I like herbal teas too.  And my husband has been experimenting with making oat milk and while it's not at all like dairy....I kind of like it in black tea also?

HOWEVER.  Cheese is a different story.  I don't eat a ton but I do like to have something like an english muffin pizza with lunch a couple times a week and honestly, it's really yum.  I also think it provides some specific satisfaction that makes me feel yeah, that was a good lunch so I don't wind up grazing on unsatisfying snacks all afternoon (which makes me feel not so great physically also). However, after a couple of weeks with no milk I'm noticing that on days I have my english muffin pizza at lunch, my stomach feels not so hot in the afternoons and evenings.  GRRRR!  My husband is 100% NOT on board with the idea of giving up cheese (even for a couple of weeks to test) so unlike milk, it's not as simple as well, we just won't buy it.

I know from an IE standpoint I should probably just let this resolve naturally and not try to ban cheese from my diet and at some point the discomfort will become great enough or so obviously connected to the food that I just DON'T want to eat it.  But right now I am feeling soooooooo uncomfortable and am wondering WHY THE FUCK I ATE THAT ENGLISH MUFFIN PIZZA AT LUNCH!!!

So, I dunno.  What should I be doing?  Buy some Lactaid pills? Research vegan cheese options?  Any other ideas for something yummy at lunch that might scratch the same itch as toasty melty cheese? Mostly I'm just annoyed that right as I have figured out how to enjoy cheese without making myself sick from bingeing on it...it seems to be turning on me.  Life is not fair, wah wah wah wah.

Really, I just want some commiseration from people who are not going to immediately tell me that yup, dairy is the devil and destroying your digestive tract and did you know you might also have a gluten sensitivity and oh you're probably eating too much sugar and HEY! Wouldn't a Whole30 be a great thing to try right now?

To make it short: after 4 years of restrictive eating disorders (anorexia and then orthorexia) I stopped counting calories for good. I quite like my image, but what's very detrimental to me is the fact that I can't stop weighting myself and from seeing my weight fluctuate I sometimes panic wanting to go back to the restrictions/my underweight body.
I weight myself 3/4 times a day and of course the best thing would be to simply go cold turkey : ditch the scale, throw it away.
But I can't: my mom is obsessed with weighting herself at least once a day, for she wants to ""monitor her weight so it doesn't go too far up or down"".
She even refused to hide it in another room even when I was severely underweight and recovering from anorexia (just like she refused to pay for a therapist or a dietician or a gynecologist, which led me to years and years of recovery and I'm not quite there yet)!

With wheat, foods with a little bit in them (like beer, fake meat products) seem to be fine but I've recently tried to cut out things like baked goods, cereal, etc. because I feel noticeably bad if I have them and feeling sick/nauseous is a trigger to binge for me. Lately I've been really struggling with not eating wheat (and not subsequently bingeing) and I feel like it's because I'm now ""restricting"" wheat products which is a trigger even though I'm restricting them as gently as I can manage in order to feed my body what will make it feel the best.

Favorite salad toppings?,21,icxkao,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/icxkao/favorite_salad_toppings/,46,"Just to start this post off: salads used to be a huge diet food for me in that they were ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and didn‚Äôt challenge any of my food rules.

This summer, I‚Äôve really been craving them (mainly because they require minimal cooking/stove/oven use in the heat, but also because I‚Äôm the kind of person who loves any food that can be customized with ALLLLLL the toppings - I‚Äôm a freak for oatmeal, fro yo, smoothie bowls, etc.) but I‚Äôm feeling stuck with my salad ideas right now.

So I guess this is a long-winded way of asking: what toppings do y‚Äôall LOVE putting on your salads?

HAES Dietitian VS Therapist?,14,ic2wps,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ic2wps/haes_dietitian_vs_therapist/,9,"Hey everyone. It's been a while! 

I am at the point in my IE journey where I need a little professional help. I have discovered that just intuitive eating on my own, along with lots of journaling, reading, and the IE workbook, I still have a really toxic relationship with food.

It's not the same as before. I haven't gone back to dieting. I always honor my hunger and cravings. I am definitely better. I have noticed the changes, like no longer binging, being able to go for seconds OR stop eating when my body tells me I either am still hungry or have had enough. That alone is huge for me.

But, through this journey I have also learned a lot about myself and my relationship with food. How it likely got started, and how my struggles are a little different than some other people. 

I have been putting it off, assuming if I just do IE correctly, I can do it on my own. But sadly, I think I need either a therapist or a dietitian. The problem is I don't know which would be better, or if I need both?

Can anyone help me figure out what each of them does with IE, and decide which to look for first?

Since i know this is often the first question people ask lol.. I have been IE for a year? Maybe a little longer. I honestly don't remember my start date, since the beginning was rocky and I Fell back into dieting a few times in the very beginning.

And yes.. I went through the first phase of eating all the foods. Like a long time ago lol. It's not that or about still restricting. It's just i need help with my mental health.",1597763819.0
Getting used to healthy vs. unhealthy food?,11,ibyrps,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ibyrps/getting_used_to_healthy_vs_unhealthy_food/,7,"So hear me out. I get the whole 'all food is equal' thing, especially in ED-recovery and why we want to approach it like this because otherwise, restriction makes us obsessed about what we want to avoid and crave it even more etc.  
But one thing I noticed is purely physical: If I were to eat, let's say, a pretzel bun for breakfast for a while, my body would rather crave this. If I ate a muffin everyday, my body wouldn't know they are other options that serve it better and ask for this, and when I eat it, it will feel good, but couldn't this just be because when a body really needs something, it's usually happy with whatever it gets? If my body needs maybe protein, but the only protein it 'knows' is in the form of..protein shakes or chicken sandwiches or whatever, it will crave those to get it. Right? If I eat 'healthier' for a few days and my body realized that eggs or chicken tights exist and are available to me, it will crave those now when it needs protein or so.   


Does anyone get me? It's no secret that while we want to treat foods equal, they of course are not equally made up science-wise. What I do is often eating the healthy options I truly like, and I will actually crave them more, and I DO enjoy this because my body is really happy about actual satiating nutrients, and maybe it's a mind placebo effect, but I feel better mentally knowing I'm providing it good things that are more useful for it to heal. But sometimes, I feel kind of guilty for that because I don't treat 'food equal'. I'm not restricting tho, but rather gently trying to build long term habits and making the way easy with preparing and having it at home. Before my ED, I ate paleo for a few years to try and relieve serious stomach issues I had, and I felt SO GOOD - during my ED, I ate chemically laden low calorie crap and felt horrible, but I still remember that eating less carbs works better for my own body (I could never eat anything sweet in the morning, and things like waffles or muffins turn me off really bad, but scrambled eggs and salami sound so much better - protein makes my body really happy, lol).

Can't let go of the scale + focusing too much on my body because of sports,11,ibfwm0,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ibfwm0/cant_let_go_of_the_scale_focusing_too_much_on_my/,8,"Hi! This is my first post here so I hope everything is in order. Also English is not my first language so please excuse potential mistakes.

So I'm 27 and I've been trying to eat intuitively for years now, after suffering from anorexia/bulimia in my late teens then binge eating in my early twenties. Last year I read The Fuck It Diet and it confirmed what I was already trying to do: stop trying to loose weight and instead trying to honor my hunger and (important) pleasure. I've been ""overeating"" a bit with this method (like eating pastries twice a day, daily) but it also helped me stop bingeing, and my weight stopped climbing.

I didn't weight myself when I was at home, didn't own a scale. But since I came to my parent's house for lockdown (so it's been like 5 months), they own one and I began weighting myself again. Like, everyday, even twice a day this past week. I know it's useless. I don't let it affect me, but I'm still afraid it will on a less conscious level. I don't know how to stop, it's becoming an addiction.

I also began rock climbing so I'm exercising more than usual. I love climbing, it's fun, but it's getting me focused on my body again. Part of me wants to get smaller (I'm mid-size/plus-size) a it would be easier to climb. A bigger part of me doesn't want that, because I don't believe in purposeful weight loss. It also ties to the scale question, because it will probably naturally make me lose a bit of weight (I'm gaining muscle so it's gonna affect my metabolism, and it's quite a work-out) and it makes me hope to see it on the scale. I thought I was past that in my journey!

I did try to focus a lot on changing my mindset about food and forbidden foods and kept working on accepting myself as I gained some weight.

I haven't bought/read any of the recommended books and workbooks yet, mainly because I'm not sure IE will work for me?

Lemme explain briefly. I started having stomach and appetite issues fiveish years ago. My appetite was just tiny, I lost weight without wanting to. I've always loved food, eating and cooking. I've never restricted myself, and either ran or played soccer so just kind of assumed everything would balance out. Like, I assumed I'd eat more when I was hungrier from exercise or life or whatever. But when my appetite issues started, everything went haywire. 

I think I have gastroparesis, which is when your stomach muscles are either fully or partially paralyzed. They don't jostle your food around to break it up, and food stays in there much longer. Leads to me feeling full very early into eating and feeling physical pain (once thought I had appendicitis) if I eat beyond that point. I saw so many doctors over the course of a year, when I had good health insurance (don't any more); got endoscopies, a colonoscopy, scans. I asked if I could have gastroparesis, and my doctor dismissed it pretty quickly. I guess my weight loss wasn't dramatic enough and the only symptom (feeling full quickly) wasn't enough for her to consider it. I wish I'd pushed it, because I really think I may have it and have way less resources and money now to pursue it. 

Anyways, the symptoms come and go. They've gotten pretty bad recently. I think this is disordered eating, but it isn't really based on restrictions (and binges), and I'm not telling myself not to eat certain things. Instead, it's more like, don't eat anything after you're full, even if your worried you're undereating, because you will be IN PAIN. 

Is there any way IE could work for me? Or should I find a way to see a doctor again? I'm just tired of feeling either so full I'm in pain from eating what look like healthy portions, or being so tired because I (think I) under ate but at least my stomach isn't killing me.

I just want a healthy relationship with food. And right now, it's laden with anxiety and fear. Also I don't think there's a real cure for gastroparesis, so if I do have it (and I'd need a doctor to confirm) I'm sort of terrified at the idea of this being the rest of my life.",1596806512.0

I was satisfied with the portion I had give myself. I was full, but I was not overly full, perhaps a 6 on the hunger scale, and the food was good enough that I would have liked to eat more...but I realized that if I did, I would probably get overly full, and that would not feel good.

This is just my experience and I respect that others may have different experiences.

I wanted to share a thought I've had over the last few days. I see a lot of a certain kind of post that is usually some variant of linking success of IE to forgetting about a certain kind of food that was, I'm assuming, forbidden in the past. Usually it's ice cream or cookies or ""junk"" food. I'm starting to realize how detrimental it was for me to internalize that that is the *only* way to know you're ""succeeding"" at IE so I wanted to offer an alternative. And no, I don't want it to sound like anyone told me that that is how to know IE is working. I just saw other people succeeding in this way and my brain put two and two together. In hindsight, I should've sat down and thought about/researched what succeeding at IE would look like for me personally.

I have been doing IE for almost a year and started to wonder when my ""I forgot about the jar of nutella in the cabinet"" moment would come. To me, nutella turned  from forbidden junk into just another food during my IE journey. I never forgot that I bought it, nor did I obsess over it. I eat it when I want it, sometimes that means opening the pantry and seeing it and thinking ""hmph, good enough. Not exactly what I want in this moment but I also don't want to get in my car and drive to the grocery store for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.""

I guess what I am trying to say is that, yes for some people, forgetting about an item of food they bought means that they are no longer obsessing over it or craving it so much and that is so freeing and beautiful. But for others, you may never get to that point. I think both are great. I hope I didn't tread on anyone's toes in this post. I just wanted to open up what success could look like and offer alternatives of signs of progress :)",1596218538.0

Last week I stayed with my parents for a week who live in the countryside as I wanted a break from London. It was the first time I had seen my parents since starting intuitive eating and it was like a light bulb went off regarding just how far my mum had brought me up to have diet culture ingrained in me. 

She knows I am practicing intuitive eating and she understands what that means in practice.  But despite this she tried to police my food intake, or assumed I would be policing my own despite me being very clear I was eating what I want when I wanted. Asking me if I was ""allowed"" to eat chips. Saying no when I asked if I could grab some chocolate from the cupboard knowing there was plenty, saying she was ""helping me because I cant help but eat the whole box"".

She also commented on my weight or how my body looked almost daily. My body composition has changed since eating intuitively, I think mainly because I've managed to stop bingeing and enjoy exercise. She kept making comments like: ""you've lost weight"", ""your legs look like they used to when you were young"", ""you look better in jeans now your legs have got thin"".

In hindsight, it is no wonder I grew up with a very unhealthy relationship with my food and body. I am not angry with her though. I feel sorry for her. I believe she says and does these things because she struggles herself with body image and wants me to be happy, and thinks the only way I can be is through restriction and trying to be thin. 

My dad made me laugh. Every time he heard her saying something like that he would say something like ""no, no! She looks happy and as though she has rejected the confines of diet culture!"" At least he gets it!

This is one aspect why the restrictive thoughts often still get me: When knowing I can eat XY amount of calories, I am more willing to allow myself to eat when I feel I need to, even without clear hunger signs.

Now (26F) I‚Äôve spent the last 3 years undoing all the  ‚Äúdamage‚Äù I did post college. I‚Äôve tried to learn how a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person is supposed to eat while exercising a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù amount. Along the way I definitely developed  disordered eating habits. Restricting calories so much for so long and then bingeing on jars of peanut butter. Over this time however, I‚Äôve lost a substantial amount of weight, learned how to exercise in ways that I love, and am finally getting some body confidence that I have been lacking for several years. 

Now I‚Äôm ready to heal my relationship with food. I feel good physically and I can do all the things I couldn‚Äôt do 3 years ago although, I‚Äôm still overweight. I‚Äôm not a skinny person that gains weight and goes on a diet to lose the weight. I‚Äôm not a yo-yo dieter. I‚Äôve just been a caloric deficit for so long and I‚Äôm trying to find my way out. A few months ago I was thinking that now that I‚Äôm close to my ‚Äúgoal weight,‚Äù what next? I can‚Äôt count calories for the rest of my life, but as soon as I stop counting them I gain a lot. I started looking into IE and thought I would give it a shot. I don‚Äôt have much to lose and if all else fails, I know how to lose weight, I‚Äôve been doing it for years. 

So I‚Äôve been practicing IE for 2 months, listening to podcasts, reading books and blogs. Really trying to understand the science of what I‚Äôve been doing to my body for so long. So far it‚Äôs going well and I feel amazing and I love not having to count every calorie. I love getting to eat breakfast again and snacks and surprising I find I‚Äôm full after only 1 plate full of food. I use to save all my calories so I could have ginormous dinners at the end of the day. 

I know I‚Äôm supposed to love my body at any size but in the back of my mind I‚Äôm terrified of being obese again. I was miserable, and not just from an aesthetic point of view. I felt horrible all the time and I never want to feel that way again. I know if I truly delve into IE and forget all of my food rules and get in touch with my body, my body will do what‚Äôs best for it. But I can‚Äôt get that thought out of my mind. I‚Äôm also tall (5‚Äô10) and I‚Äôve always held my weight well. Even when I was obese I looked good. I‚Äôm not scared so much of what I will look like, but more of how I will feel if my body needs to gain a lot of weight. I also lost my mom to breast cancer 2 years ago. She was extremely unhealthy and also overweight, so I have an overwhelming drive to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù for my family. The mental part of this is just so hard. I feel like I‚Äôm mostly reading advice for yo-yo dieters that are gaining and losing the same amount of weight over and over again. But what about me? I don‚Äôt know what weight my body wants to be at because I‚Äôve only ever been incredibly fit or obese. I‚Äôm just now starting to get to a happy medium and I‚Äôm terrified of losing that.",1595002100.0

For context, when I was dieting I ate a majority of veggies and fruits alongside lean meats like chicken. I didn‚Äôt allow myself to eat ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods like sweets and fast food (which is why when given the opportunity would binge until I reached the bursting point on them). I exercised to the point, not of pure exhaustion, where daily activities felt like I needed to put in extra effort. 

Anyhow, I‚Äôm 5 days in and I haven‚Äôt binged yet. I‚Äôve eaten till I‚Äôve felt satiated (I even put aside food for leftovers, which I would have never done before), yet I know the types of food I‚Äôm eating aren‚Äôt the healthiest (banana pudding, for example, is one of my favorite desserts so I‚Äôve had more than my fair share of it) and I‚Äôm eating more of it than I would have if not for restricting.

Reading the book, and sitting with these feelings has been really helpful.  üôè


I am having a really hard day on my IE journey.

I have been following IE now for the last 8 months, and honestly for the most part it has been going really well. I want to start with that. 

I do want to start by stating the big win is I no longer have any ‚Äúuncontrollable‚Äù binges, or have challenging emotions around certain foods anymore!  

I feel like after working through the books I have come to a much better place with my relationship to food, and I really do value that. I feel I have absolutely embraced challenging the food police, incorporated gentle nutrition, and I move joyfully.  

These are all huge wins!

My problem is finding body neutrality.  Just when I think I have made my way there: BAM...I think to myself: ‚ÄúWill my body find it‚Äôs way to a few pounds down?‚Äù

I am really struggling. It definitely doesn‚Äôt help that most of my friends are challenging each other on social media to ‚ÄúLose those Quarantine pounds‚Äù.  I have mostly been able to ignore it, but lately...I feel that terrible pull from a place I don‚Äôt want to go back to.

I logically know I never want to go back to the diet-culture way of doing things, but I feel knocked off my progress in a way that surprised me. I really thought I had found a way to let go of wanting to be smaller.

Kind of figuring out gentle nutrition,14,hqlxnw,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hqlxnw/kind_of_figuring_out_gentle_nutrition/,4,"So I have been working on intuitive eating for about 8 months, going fine with normal ups and downs but overall happy with my attitude toward food and my body. My doctor is great and is supportive, but wanted to do some blood tests last week to monitor some other health stuff that is ongoing (thyroid mostly). 

He checked my cholesterol as it was high back in Feb, and it came back quite a bit higher than it was then. No huge surprise, I love ice cream and butter!

The nice thing for me is - I have something to focus on with my nutrition that is not weight focused. In the past, I failed with trying to implement gentle nutrition because my brain only equated it with weight loss. Now that I know my cholesterol is too high, I have something else to focus on.

Luckily there are some easy fixes for heart health. Adding more soluble fiber to my diet? Sure thing, I like oatmeal and can make an effort to eat it a few times a week. I really enjoy fruits and veggies and can certainly make them more of a focal point in most meals. I also really like salmon and other fish that are rich in healthy fats, so easy enough to make an effort to serve them more. 

Obviously outright restricting won't do any good, but I do find myself thinking a little harder about wanting certain foods and how it may effect my heart and blood. Like, do I really want Oreos right now? Hmmm, they actually don't sound that good when I think about what eating too many might do to my health. Or they may sound AMAZING and I will have a couple. Either way is ok. 

Anyway, just finally realizing that having something tangible that I can focus on and imagine (I imagine my arteries getting clogged up and that is a little scary) is really helping me focus on making a few choices that will better serve my health and do NOT have anything to do with weight loss.",1594668404.0

I managed to get rid of it initially starting IE. But recently I've realised that it's back in a different form. Previously I'd feel guilty for eating something ""bad""like Ice cream or biscuits. But now I get guilt if I even eat something healthy like an apple or orange. It happens like this: I've been reading Evelyn Tribolis book. And what I've grasped from it is that eating should be mindful and enjoyed. So whenever I zone out during eating and eat a bit too fast without being really conscious I feel bad. Like even something simple as an apple. If I feel that I didn't enjoy the food,I feel guilty. Sometimes I feel obligated to leave food on the plate because I'm supposed to be satisfied with half the amount coz that's what IE does right? I'm afraid I've misunderstood certain concepts. Sometimes I have issues when I'm the last to eat at home and my mother has left food for me. So I tend to try ""clean my plate"". Sometimes I feel guilty for not cleaning my plate too. Idk what but the sense of relief I initially got from IE is going away. It's like I have trouble with the fact that I need to be 100% conscious and feel what I eat or else I've wasted calories and failed. Even if it's like just a small amount. At times I tend to apply IE only to foods which I know are of high calorie like Ice cream and rice but not to stuff like lower calorie fruits and leafy greens.So i just mindlessly eat some fruit and then feel gulity beacuse i didnt apply IE principles.in fact I know IE looks at all food equally so I'm not practicing it correctly.it gets so hard sometimes. I need assistance and any advice. What do you do if your mother has already prepared food for you and you don't get the chance to really think what kind of food you  desire for breakfast.

I know a lot of people buy treadmills and never use them, or at least not as much as they thought they would, but that hasn't really been the case for me. 

When I first got it, I was definitely still trying to change my body. I knew I got it for cardio when I couldn't go walk or run outside. 

And even though I had convinced myself during my IE journey that I just wanted to use it for my heart health, it still felt a little forced. But I thought it was just this weird connection between the treadmill and trying to lose weight.

Lately, I have been trying to pay more attention to what my body wants as far as movement goes. It's almost like I can *feel* what I want to do. Some days it's yoga or Pilates, other days it's beginner weightlifting videos on YouTube. Sometimes, it's going for a walk. 

Yesterday I felt like walking, so I went on the treadmill, and after 10 minutes I was just like OKAY THIS SUCKS. I knew instantly I was just over it. But then last night I ended up going for a walk at the beach and my body and mind loved it. Just being outside and in the fresh air and walking in a much more joyful way.

I'm just mentioning this here because sometimes it takes really listening to why we aren't enjoying something. It tends to take me a little longer to realize I am forcing something out of habit, not because I actually like doing it.

I'm less of a chronic dieter, and more of a chronic overeater. I'm a stress-eater, often obsessing over certain types of foods, but then when I get them and binge, I feel disgusted with myself and with the food. I'll tell myself ""well, I'll remember this feeling next time, and I won't give in."" But the cycle just keeps repeating. 

I also have a lot of food anxiety. When I was kid, we never had set meal times or any kind of schedule, so even though I never went a day without eating (unless I was sick), I could go several hours being very hungry, and then I'd binge the next time I got food. Now, as an adult, I have a hard time leaving leftovers because I'm afraid I'll be hungry later. I FEAR hunger.

But grocery shopping also gives me a great deal of anxiety. The idea of trying to put a meal together, much less a whole week's worth, feels way too overwhelming. But shopping once a day is exhausting because I HATE going to the grocery store. I'm an introvert, I don't like being around a lot of people. But I also don't like the idea of paying extra to have my food delivered, and not being able to pick my own produce. I try to go at times when I know it won't be too busy, but I still have a hard time staying in the store long enough to get everything I came for. I just want to hurry up and leave as soon I walk in the door, so I almost never try new things. I just grab what I know how to prepare, and get out. I'm getting so bored of all of our usual stuff, though, and so is my husband.

And then there's cooking. Cooking also gives me anxiety. Will I burn myself? Will I ruin the food? Will I set the kitchen on fire? Will I have everything prepared and ready at the same time? Every step of the food process gives me anxiety, it seems... except going out to eat. I LOVE going out to eat, which is another reason to hate this pandemic. Going out to eat relaxes me. I get to spend quality, unstressful time with my husband or my friends, and I know I'll have yummy food because someone else is cooking it. We've occasionally gotten take out and delivery the last several months, but it's not the same. And even though some restaurants have re-opened their dining services, I'm not comfortable putting myself and others at risk just because I'm ""too lazy"" to cook for myself.

So I guess like everyone else here I am looking for ways to have a better relationship with food, but maybe coming at it from a different perspective. I've never been good at following a diet, or counting calories. I'll usually try for a week or two at most, then I give up because it seems too overwhelming. But I do think people like me still suffer at the hands of the diet industry because there is a heavy weight of guilt associated with eating ""bad"" foods, especially bingeing. I hope this book (and the workbook, which I also have) will help me. The idea of ""gentle nutrition"" and ""joyful movement"" appeals to me, the idea of taking care of myself in a loving way.

What I learned after keeping a food journal for a month,40,hiwn1b,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hiwn1b/what_i_learned_after_keeping_a_food_journal_for_a/,14,"CW: some mention of calories, but no numbers.

So, I've been trying to eat intuitively for about a year and a half. Prior to this, I was on a highly restrictive calorie counting ""diet"" on and off for two-to-three years.

Due to a combination of trying to get in better shape (strength training and cardio), wanting to know more about nutrition, and, to be completely honest, trying to get my weight to stabilize, I decided to do more work on the ""gentle nutrition"" aspect of IE. I also had some compulsive eating to work through. For all my life, food has been my #1 coping mechanism for stress.

I also wanted to understand how different foods effect me. For the longest time I had convinced myself that all food made me feel the same. I didn't think I felt all that different after eating a cookie vs. a high-protein salad. I knew this couldn't be true, so I was curious to get to the bottom of this.

Basically, what I did was write notes at the beginning of the day and end of the day on how I felt (how much sleep I got, whether I was exercising, whatever). I'd also jot down what I was eating and when, along with where I was on the hunger scale (1-10) before and after the meal. I'd also write down my feelings afterwards (whether I enjoyed it, felt guilty, ate too much, etc.)

Here's what I learned:

1. **I usually overestimated the amount I was eating...‚Äì** Even on days when I ate very little I just assumed I was over-eating. Good old diet mentality.
2. **...and therefore, I was actually not eating** ***enough‚Äì*** For the most part my appetite balanced itself out; I'd eat more one day and less the next. I never felt overly hungry, but because I exercise, I wasn't getting enough fuel for my workouts. For the past few months my weight has continued to creep up, so I'm not under-eating all the time. I'm probably still caught in a subtle restrict/binge cycle because I don't fully trust my body yet.
3. **Journaling** ***did*** **trigger some calorie counting behavior‚Äì** After the first week I had a morbidly curious impulse and I went back and roughly calculated all my calories (this was partly how I realized I wasn't eating enough). Next time I journal I'll keep it more general (e.g. ""I ate some fruit and a salad"" vs. 1 peach, salad with balsamic vinaigrette, etc.). After that first week, however, I haven't been tempted to count again.
4. **It did also trigger some diet thoughts...** At the beginning I was eating far less, and I couldn't help but think ""now that I'm paying attention to what I eat, maybe I'll finally lose some weight!"" I even patted myself on the back for not eating until noon on the second day.
5. **...But calling out my diet thoughts like that helped me work through them‚Äì** After a while most of these diet thoughts just went away.
6. **What I'm craving isn't always what my body needs**‚Äì This was the biggest takeaway for me. I've always had a sweet tooth, and sugar has been a huge part of the ""refeed"" phase for me. Also, for the past two years that I've been doing strength training, I frequently hit plateaus, and my progress has been very slow. As an experiment, I thought I'd try eating more protein. As soon as I started, my sugar cravings *vanished*. After doing a little research, I discovered that protein (and fat and fiber) help stabilize blood sugar. This entire time (my whole life, basically), I've been riding a blood sugar rollercoaster. When I was restricting food, I had dizzy spells all the time. I even *went blind* for a minute while on the subway, commuting to work once. Even after I stopped dieting, I had days when I *had* to have orange juice first thing in the morning or I'd be dizzy. Since upping my protein intake, that's stopped happening. I no longer feel like garbage first thing in the morning because now I can go 10-12 hours without food.
7. **So yes, food does effect how I feel!‚Äì** It didn't hit me until I started eating more protein, but if I eat a lot of refined carbs my blood sugar goes crazy. When I had pasta for lunch and dinner, and I majorly crashed in the evening. Eating a variety of foods is so important! If I have a high-protein meal earlier in the day, before the pasta, I feel fine. Making simple changes, like having whole wheat toast in the morning, had a big effect on my energy levels.
8. **Eating properly helps SO MUCH with sleep‚Äì** Since I started intentionally eating more protein, I now sleep like a rock. In the past I probably wasn't recovering properly from exercise (especially when I was dieting).
9. **I was over-indulging all the time and** ***not even realizing it‚Äì*** I'm blessed with a strong stomach, so for me, over-eating usually results in a quick, uncomfortable trip to the bathroom, and then I feel fine and forget about it. Because of this, I didn't realize just how often I was over-indulging, especially on sweets. Writing it down made me more aware of it, and now it hasn't happened in weeks.
10. **Simply writing my feelings down put a stop to my food guilt‚Äì** Looking back over my entries, I was shocked to see how *guilty* I felt about my food choices for the first few days. For the past couple of weeks guilt hasn't come up for me at all.
11. **I kind of don't stress-eat anymore‚Äì** This one could always come back because I go through phases. However, another thing I was shocked to see, looking back, is how almost manic my thoughts were when it came to food. I'd be absolutely stuffed one second, and then a minute later think about having ice cream. I was compulsively drinking water, tea, and soda to deal with feelings of discomfort and stress. Since paying more attention to these thoughts they've subsided significantly.
12. **My hunger cues were completely out of whack‚Äì** As part of my journaling, I tried to record my hunger on a scale of 1-10 before and after a meal. I had a really hard time figuring out how hungry I was, especially before a meal. I kept reporting that my stomach felt ""weird,"" far more often than I actually felt hungry. I'm still working on figuring out when I'm truly hungry.
13. And finally, **Food isn't evil, nor is it magical, energy-giving manna from the gods‚Äì** Back when I was dieting, all my energy went toward restricting food. I felt like I had to constantly be on guard, otherwise I'd completely lose control. A few weeks ago, I went in  the total opposite direction: I was so excited by how much better I felt while eating right (and *enough*) that I way overdid exercise. For about six weeks I was doing strength training and cardio *nearly every day*. As a result, I had to take a full week completely off exercise, and even after that break I'm still feeling exhausted. No matter how great your ""diet"" is, or how in tune you are with your body's needs, no food is a substitute for rest.

Whew, sorry, that was LOOONG.

Conclusion: I HIGHLY recommend trying a food journalling.

Looking back over my journal, there's some stuff that already seems second-nature to me, but was a huge revelation just a few weeks ago. I still have a lot to work on, especially stopping when I'm full, and figuring out when I'm ready to eat. I don't have the patience (or mental energy) to journal all the time, and think overdoing it would contribute to diet thoughts. Still, it's a helpful tool that I'll definitely revisit in the future.",1593552249.0

Struggling,12,hh4r5n,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hh4r5n/struggling/,4,"I've been doing IE for almost a year now and have had some ups and downs but mostly felt really good about it.  But recently I'm really struggling.  My husband and I have been dealing with infertility for the past two years, and earlier this year we finally decided to go for IVF.  I went through the egg retrieval process in February, we got a good embryo, and were scheduled to have the transfer in April.  Then the covid pandemic hit and the transfer was delayed as it's an elective procedure.  Now it's back on, and scheduled to happen in a week.

So for the past three weeks I've been pumping myself full of the hormones needed to get my body ready, which is making me kind of bloated and probably also impacting my mood.  At the same time, covid cases in the US are, well, going through the roof.  My particular area is doing okay but cases here have started to slowly tick up. Some other parts of the state are doing terribly and apparently some patients from those areas are being relocated to our local hospitals.  I remember how quickly things shut down in March and I'm absolutely terrified that the whole thing is going to repeat, that I'm going to get a phone call this week saying sorry, it's off.  I'm also definitely wondering if it's really the right time to be getting pregnant but...fuck, we've been trying for two years and I'm not getting any younger.

At the same time, I'm honestly somewhat petrified of getting pregnant.  If this embryo sticks, it will be my second pregnancy so I know what's coming. With my first pregnancy I had awful morning sickness from weeks 6-16.  I also felt totally out of control with my body and fell into patterns of bingeing and exercising obsessively.  I had hoped with my new commitment to IE I would be able to relax about all that, but, well....it turns out knowing I am DEFINITELY going to gain 25+ lbs is still enough to do a number on me.

All of this is triggering restrictive thoughts (I think also having all the drugs that HAVE to be taken every day is adding into it somehow), basically orthorexia style thinking of I need to be eating PERFECTLY for this pregnancy to stick and to have a healthy baby.  But I'm terribly at actually sticking to an orthorexic diet so instead I'm bingeing.  And this whole being at home in a pandemic thing is a mixed bag.  On the one hand, I don't have to deal with a draining commute (which definitely exacerbated my morning sickness last time!) and in theory I have more freedom to do things like take a walk or take a midday nap if I notice I'm bingeing due to being tired.  I was actually almost looking forward to being pregnant during a pandemic a few weeks ago because I wouldn't have to go out to the office and put on this front of ""everything's normal!!"" while running to the bathroom to vomit multiple times per day. But....I'm feeling REALLY cooped up.  I also have to take a covid test this week and if the test is positive, transfer is cancelled.  With cases rising, I really am pretty much feeling restricted to being inside or going for walks super early in the morning when nobody else is out (and our neighborhood has also seen some random violent crime lately so now I don't even feel 100% safe walking in the very early morning or after dark).

Basically, I'm a mess and I'm eating my feelings and I know that's okay and sometimes it's just how you need to cope but...it's freaking me out because it's not like oh, my eating and weight will normalize in a week.  I know if everything goes according to plan, my weight's going up.  And I'm just struggling to embrace that right now.

Any advice, commiseration, encouragement?  Have you been through something like this?  How do I help myself move through to something that feels more stable?",1593303273.0

I have noticed whilst making special efforts to 'feel my fullness' that I often eat slightly more than I need to, and subsequently feel a bit uncomfortable and unpleasant.

It's more delicious home cooked meals - I'm struggling to stop eating delicious thing X now just because I might feel uncomfortable physically later. I am a massive foodie and love cooking - its genuinely a case of finding something delicious and therefore not wanting to stop eating, and often feeling this the discomfort is ""worth"" the taste.

Joyful Movement,30,hescis,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hescis/joyful_movement/,6,"Hello, this is a little victory as well as an info share...I've really struggled with getting back into intentional,  joyful movement since I started IE.  All my adult life I rarely engaged in athletic activity (I was active as in hiking,  gardening,  etc.) unless it was attached to a punishing diet.  My binge/diet cycle was so black and white that discarding dieting meant I also rebelled against fitness.

IE has given me insight into how I eat emotionally...i haven't completely discarded binging behaviors, but have let go of the most frenetic, obsessive emotional parts of the diet cycle. Which is HUGE.

SO my IE journey started about 5 or 6 months ago,  and there had been a lot of weigh gain. A lot. I keep reminding myself that I'm fixing decades of harm and it takes time.  And because I rejected physical movement as an adjunct to diet (in my brain), I've gotten stiffer and stiffer, more inflamed and tired out. I know what its like to be in a bigger body (I've lived in and left one and returned many times,  after all), and have adjusted to certain positions and movements being more difficult. Honestly if dieting produces weight cycling that returns me to this place over and over again,  what's the merit of debating whether it is more ""difficult"" to live in a large body? I acknowledge the feels about it and try to move on.  I have to also come to terms with the fact that I have never tried to stay mobile and exercise regularly in a large body (because I'm hiding!) and I have never actually tested whether I can feel strong and flexible in a body this size. 

Until now! My victory is that I found some movement that I love!!! It is paid content but I'm ok with that...Kaisa has a Mobility One routine (10, 30 and 40 minutes) that is focused on loosening joints,  opening hips and stretching dynamically and it is AWESOME. There is no talk of toning, slimming, etc. Every move can be modified or done at your own pace.  The instructor is not insanely thin. I just wanted to share that I really,  seriously enjoy these routines. Love in struggle xoxo",1592965135.0

I‚Äôve posted in the past about the conflict between caffeine and my ability to eat intuitively. Caffeine really curbs my appetite, which leads to bingeing at night, but I finally feel like I‚Äôve figured out a good compromise.

I‚Äôm no longer drinking my coffee before eating. I am waiting until I have breakfast in the morning to have my first cup, and then as the caffeine from the first cup dies down in the afternoon, I eat a full lunch, to full satiation, before having my second cup. The caffeine from the second cup dies down in the evening so I have a nice full appetite for dinner. I am also reminding myself to eat some snacks throughout the day even when my appetite is not fully there. There are definitely things I love to eat even when I‚Äôm not fully hungry. 

Two cups was actually a major reduction for me, and now that I‚Äôm adjusted it is a very welcome change as I‚Äôm less anxious and more relaxed. I‚Äôm also trying to caffeinate intuitively, so sometimes I will not finish a cup if I am energized enough already.

Having trouble squaring IE with fitness goals,10,hczh9j,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hczh9j/having_trouble_squaring_ie_with_fitness_goals/,37,"So... I'll attempt keep this brief: I calorie counted for a few years, but last year I stopped that and started doing IE. I gained a lot of weight this past year, but I also doubled down on my fitness efforts (weightlifting and cardio).

I made tons of progress in weightlifting after I stopped dieting, but after about a year it stalled again. I finally realized this probably had a lot to do with my diet. I was finally eating enough, but I wasn't eating the right kinds of food.

I briefly kept a food journal earlier this month, and I realized... duh! I was barely getting any protein. After I started eating more protein, I pretty much immediately started feeling better. I have much more energy, I've been sleeping well, and I can focus better. I used to get out-of-control sugar cravings, but since incorporating more protein in my diet, my sugar cravings are gone, and I don't seem to get blood sugar spikes and crashes anymore. My diet's a little boring atm, but I feel pretty satisfied with it anyway. I guess this is the ""gentle nutrition"" part of IE?

The trouble is, though, that eating the recommended amount of protein for someone of my height and weight, who's trying to build muscle, is *hard*. It's so filling! I'm pretty much only eating chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, fruits, and veggies, and I'm still supposed to be eating WAY more protein.

I'm trying to respect my fullness cues and not stuff myself. To be quite honest, I'm afraid of overeating because I'm sorta tired of gaining weight. Sometimes, though, it seems like I feel better and see more results if I *do* eat more than is comfortable. It's hard to reconcile eating *just* to fullness and eating *enough* to meet my goals.

I was in my bed reading an article when I heard my stomach grumble.

How many times have I done this before?‚Äù I got out of bed and immediately went to go eat. As I was getting my food ready, I was paying attention to how my body felt. I didn‚Äôt feel any pain or discomfort. If someone were to ask me how I felt, I would‚Äôve said fine and not hungry at all.

I then realized that because of the diet mentality, I wasn‚Äôt used to eating every couple of hours (even though the IE book said 4-6 hours is the norm) which led me to think that my clearly defined hunger was false.

What to do about compulsive eating?,5,hbmn84,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hbmn84/what_to_do_about_compulsive_eating/,20,"
This post is going to be a little messy. I'm not really sure how to explain this, so bear with me here.

Every night, right after dinner i get the urge to eat something sweet. Sometimes it's because i genuinely crave it, but i get this every night and i've noticed that most of the time i don't even really want anything. I just feel the urge to eat something because that's what i usually do after dinner. It's not emotional eating, it's more like an itch that i NEED to scratch in order to feel comfortable. 
I guess i'm just not sure what to do. I'm very prone to OCD / compulsive behavior with non-food related things as well, and the only solution for that is usually to fight the urge or it'll progressively get worse. But in this case i'm worried that'll be restricting. On the other hand though i don't want to eat stuff i don't actually want just because?

So basically: do i take the OCD approach or the IE approach?
(And what *does* IE say in this case? I know it says to eat whatever you're craving but i really don't know if this counts as a craving or not.) 


Ps: i say 'OCD"" but i'm using this term pretty lightly. It's not diagnosed or anything, i just don't know what else to call it. It's compulsive behavior that i've always had issues with in all sorts of things. I can only describe it as a strong, mental itch. Very annoying.",1592513154.0
"Intuitive eating impossible for me? Gallbladder problems, history of binge eating.",8,hbh7a0,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/hbh7a0/intuitive_eating_impossible_for_me_gallbladder/,7,"Im a woman in my early twenties; I started doing a generic version of intuitive eating for about two years after seeing a dietitian/counselor because of a period of binge/compulsive eating.  I grew up in almost IE ideal, what I ate was never really comented on negatively and I wasn't really in the 'clean plate club'or anything.  Most of my family is in bigger bodies, my mother was ""overweight"" my whole life and was never shamey about food or nutrition.  I never restricted growing up but I've always had a big appetite for enjoyable foods and I frequently ate when bored or for flavor and my weight was pretty much steadily going up until my early twenties.  I only knew about this because of being weighed at the doctor every couple years but I didnt really have an emotional attachment to the number and my self image was always pretty good about my looks.  When I started college I was stress eating a lot and I gained a lot of weight fast- I started working and going to school and I had increasing incidences where I would eat way past fullness untill I would feel physically sick.  I dropped out and worked two physically demanding jobs and that's when I started having more serious problems with it to the point I was referred to a dietitian who put me on a loose three meal and day plus snacks meal plan and encouraged me to eat intuitively once I was eating regularly.  
 We butted heads after I refused to give up dietary veganism, which I follow for ethical reasons and have happily adhered to since I was 14.  She claimed it was restrictive however I eat basically vegan versions of almost every 'normal' dish you can think of, never crave or desire non vegan food, and only crave and want the vegan food I basically grew up on.  I truly believe for me specifically (not generalizing to anyone else) that arbitrarily eating foods I dont enjoy or need nutritionaly is not in line with the principles of intuitive eating as I understand them.  
 Following what was most natural for my body I settled into a pattern of unrestricted eating with roughly two meals a day and lots of snacks.  I ate past fullness a lot but I was getting a lot of enjoyment from food, and a lot of my choices were high fat like vegetable tempura, vegan ice cream, stir fries, stuff like that.  
 This is notable because I started suffering a lot of GI symptoms, namely extreme uncomfortably bloating and increasing bad upper abdominal pain after meals.  After a year I was finally diagnosed with Gallbladder sludge/stones and I'm scheduled for removale within the next month or so.  
 To manage my symptoms I have to follow a very low fat diet, as close to fat free as possible.  I have sometimes pain so bad I cant stand up after eating small amounts of fattier foods, like a few spoonfuls of peanut butter or oil for cooking.  
 This has made intuitive eating impossible!!  I can only eat very bland foods and because of painful bloating after eating I have to have smaller portions.  Also I have to admit I believe that my food freedom in choosing my foods and my childhood of eating whatever I felt like is at least partially responsible for having this problem in the first place.  Because of the scans for my gallbladder I was diagnosed with fatty liver and high cholesterol which is uncommon in people as young as I am- especially people following a vegan diet as most vegan fats are not high cholesterol.  I work a physical job on my feet and exercise outside of work too so it really seems like its its only food choices measurably damaging my health.  I am very tempted to not eat based in craving/intuition after surgery, or limit which foods I should eat after.  I have to admit this experience has me questioning the underlying logic that binging is the natural response to restricting- I have a highly restrictive medical diet and I have not binged at all because I know the immediate painful consequences.  I have found ways to cope and handle stress without being able to use food.  
 All this to say I think for me I have to find another way to choose food and plan meals- I really think in my situation Intuitive Eating as its outlined in dietitians advice isnt appropriate.  Especially since my problematic overeating behavior doesnt seem reactive at all considering how I was raised.  I want to know if you guys have any advice on how I could rethink this situation if Intuitive eating really is for everyone/ the healthiest way to eat.",1592495456.0

I‚Äôve known since the start of high school that dieting was kind of a scam, and it‚Äôs nice to know that I‚Äôm not crazy. The last official diet I was on (Intermittent Fasting) was actually at the encouragement of my doctor this past year to help me. I was (and still am) an unconscious chaotic and waste not ‚Äúdieter‚Äù, and wanted some structure and thought IF would be good since half my family (who are in healthcare) were doing it. She‚Äôs never steered me wrong and she‚Äôs always provided top notch care, so when she said yes, I thought maybe I was wrong about diets all these years. 

Nope. I hated every moment of it though and it only made the problems I wanted to fix worse. I was irritable, always hungry, always messing it up, and started being scared of all food for the risk of me overeating. I‚Äôve always loved and respected food and ate with a nutritious balance in mind. The fact I couldn‚Äôt do that anymore broke my heart and made food a weapon for me. 

Not to mention that my family constantly criticized me for my weight even though I had a relatively clean bill of health and wasn‚Äôt fat by any means. Belly fat was like the plague in my family. Every time I tried being happy with my body, my family was there to subtly and blatantly remind me that I shouldn‚Äôt be happy with my current figure. I‚Äôm a pretty active woman, and every time my belly flattened from fitness, they would literally **cheer**. So many are in healthcare, so I thought they were just looking out for me.

Also, weird title, I know lol.

But these days, I promised myself to listen as closely as I can to my body, not weight myself for a few days and just let my body take the wheel. There have been moments where I was SO overjoyed by it - like three days ago, I was out shopping and got hungry, and even though my cupboards are so full of food, a pastry from a bakery sounded just so good. I usually don't even like anything sweet when physically hungry, but I went with it. I couldn't even wait until I was home to eat it (like a 3 minute walk), so I started munching on it on the way. It wasn't even that good as I'm usually expecting these pastries to be, the dough was flakey, but still, it did taste so good to me in that moment, the sun was shining, and my taste buds lit up so much, it was pure happiness. When I got home, I put the remaining 1/4 or so on the counter while I was unpacking. I was still hungry, but rather wanted something vanilla-milshake-like, so I made something out of protein powder and vanilla flavor and it was SO good too. I completely forgot about the rest of the pastry until hours later, when I was hungry again and I finished it.  
Yesterday, I had to wait for my mom after walking in the city for hours to go get groceries with her, and I was really tired, sleepy and so hungry by then so I went into a store nearby right before she came so I'd have some food with me while driving with her. I got some blueberries, nectarine, a big giant slice of tuna pizza and when I was almost checking out, I saw ice cream - the fruity popsicle ones, which I would never eat when hungry usually (as I said, sweets on an empty stomach make me feel weird somehow) and it was not a 'filling' food or so and very watery. But still got it. Ate it while driving with mom. It was the BEST thing ever, my taste buds lit up, I just barely stopped myself from telling my mom this cheap store popsicle for kids was basically the most fabulous thing I've ever eaten bc she might have thought I was high :D Had the by-then-soggy pizza hours later while sitting in a too hot laundry shop waiting for someone, at it was still great at satiating my hunger.  


However. I remember feeling so joyous years ago also, when I first stumbled upon intuitive eating, but somehow went back to dieting, and slipping from one to the other for another few years, never happy with one because I get anxious about something, doubt everything, then binge to 'start over' with the other concept 'tomorrow' yada yada. I have since learned a lot, and also not to treat IE as a diet and ALSO not to take any guidelines or what others do on it too seriously because what works for me is simply: whatever the fuck I want! (yes, I still have diet coke! I still don't eat too much soy or spinach or whatever because I find them too unhealthy, and other times, I do because I don't care, I read about nutrition all the time out of sheer interest, I love learning what certain chemicals do with insulin, our hormones, how I can help my iodine deficiency with eating less broccoli and more seaweed -it's one of my favorite foods, especially when toasted and covered in sesame seeds, I promise it's good! - and at the same time, I get to decide if I chose to take this information into consideration or if I'm fine with health/nutrition consequences for the sake of my pleasure and have my chemically laden diet coke, vanilla flavor or flaky pastry). Before, I took IE basically too serious, I remember reading how you should eat 'exactly what you want' and one day, I couldn't decide what it was exactly, so I drove into the city for 25 minutes, walked the streets to find the perfect spot-hitting-food, thought I found it, got some ham-and-cheese-crepe and when I bit into it, it wasn't good at all and I was completely devastated by all this effort. These days, 'good enough' is good enough!   
I also don't restrict things anymore that the IE often deems bad, especially diet food. I remember throwing all my flavoring drops out and not buying calorie free drinks anymore or fat free yogurts and trying my hardest to question whether I was eating that salad because I wanted it or because it was 'diet mentality'. Guess what I ended up craving and binging on? Fucking diet food! Damnit, I like that diet coke because I'm probably used to it from dieting for years, yes, maybe it IS some left diet mentality or maybe I don't like the actual spike in blood sugar and how it makes everything sticky when I spill it somewhere, and these flavor drops with that evil artificial sweetener are so great because I can just put a few drops into my tea or yoghurt and it turns into cookie/strawberry/whatever tasting magic while only buying one neutral flavor of tea or yoghurt - and I couldn't be bothered looking up whether to find those in a 'non diety version', I like them, that's enough reason for me.  
I now allow myself to throw out things I don't like and waste money, but also, I allow myself to eat up something even if it's not that perfect for that moment but those strawberries/salad/melon are going bad too quickly and it would hurt my poor-student-heart to have wasted money just because it wasn't the perfect moment. I'm way more relaxed and I've realized my rules are the only ones that count. 

It's still not perfect by any means, I still binge often, I get caught up in automatically counting calories in my head or getting anxiety when feeling too full or not being sure if I'm actually hungry and feeling bad for eating when not sure if I was hungry, but now I know this is what normal people do - they don't take courses to exactly determine hunger scales, nor do they worry so much about what sounds good, and if they want that piece of cake just because it's sunday and yolo, it's much more 'whatever, it's gonna be fine I guess!'. I'm not sure what would happen if I gained a bunch of weight now, I still want to lose some, but right now, it's rather because I'm okays with my body and I think it helps a lot with learning/accepting this way. But that's a worry for another day. I'm just..kind of scared that something will happen and I will lose this momentum, forget how I enjoyed this and it's freedom, or, what might be one big thing that drove me back to dieting before: The anxiety of not knowing, not controlling, not doing something I felt was progressive and like I was using self-restraint and willpower and being a responsible adult that was able to follow plans to the point and actually get results for it every day. I KNOW this is not how diets work, rationally I've worked through all of how it screws with your brain and other methods are MUCH better of a use of willpower (like, studying, working, helping others, education, saving the world, cuddling pets at animal shelters! All things that dieting actually made me NOT do because I was too busy starving) than punishing yourself for no reasonable outcome at all. But dieting is no act of rationality, I think we all know that. I'm scared that it will snap one day, and I'll go right back to use it as a coping mechanism for whatever issues I have because it sounds much better than, you know, actual coping mechanism like dealing with the problems etc.

Literally nothing. I have been browsing for 45 minutes, and none of my usuals sound good at all. That's when I was like.. oh, ok this has never happened to me before. It has always been my go-to when I don't want to cook, which is often since I am lazy and a super picky eater. 

It's a bit annoying, but mostly I'm just happy to have reached the point where food isn't the end all, be all thing anymore. It's not the ONE thing I love above all else, that I think about constantly, and that rules (or ruins) my life.

How do you 'not restrict'?,5,gzt8ha,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/gzt8ha/how_do_you_not_restrict/,5,"I've red it all, I've tried it all, I've failed at it all.  
These last months, I've thought a lot about what Isabel Foxen Duke says in her Interviews/podcasts and it really resonates with me: Also to her, the concept of Intuitive Eating (the 'street version', not the more researched and updated one that doesn't not make IE a hunger-and-satiety-diet) felt like just any other kind of restriction, until she came to a point where she 'surrendered', gave up, realized she can't control her eating. So she let herself be, and treated hunger and satiety as only informations that she's free to listen to, but also free to not to, maybe when she wants a brownie and she's not hungry, but it's sunday and yolo - she will have one, if she actually wants it. In the end, this gives you the option to chose what to do, to not overeat because it genuinely makes you feel bad, and to chose something that will make you feel good (maybe a salad because you know you will not feel lethargic after lunch at work, or said brownie because you'll be happy about it).¬†

I truly vibe with that and agree. But, still, I can NOT not restrict. Even if I know that it might end in a binge, there's always that fear that not making rational decisions will make me gain weight and if I don't have an overview by counting calories or only eating when hungry, I will inevitably have a bite here and there and it will at least slowly creep up. Even if I ate according to what would be 'maintenance calories' for my body and all that, I believe I would gain a lot of weight because of how my metabolism has changed, my completely wrecked thyroid and sitting around all day. She tackles this with questioning body imagines and whether it's actually that bad if we gained weight or not. But my mind is refusing to even tap into that idea, because I've been skinny and SAW that it made a lot of things in life easier for me - SADLY! I don't actually WANT to be 'fully happy' in a body 40lbs heavier, because I have been, long before I even thought about food and dieting and body images, and it still made life harder for me simply because of how our society is. I know, I might get some raised eyebrows on this and people saying that I should work on that more and deeper, and I get this fully - but it still doesn't change how the world interacts with me no matter how content I am about my body. I feel bad to admitting this, but it feels like..going for a job interview in a night gown - yes, you can be fully proud and happy and accepting about it, but chances are, you won't get that job. You could look for another job, sure, but if that's the one you want, you'll have to change your outfit.   


Either way, even without all this body image talk, I still want to 'not restrict' simply because I'm tired of obsessing, worrying, and especially, binging/purging and seriously harming my health that isn't so great to begin with. So my motivation is a different one, but still very strong - I just don't know how to stop my brain from panicking when I allow myself a cookie, then watch my hand grab the fifth one and hear my thoughts questioning if 'we should better full on binge so we can purge it because five eaten cookies is worse that ten purged ones' (I agree, it's stupid, but these are my automatic thoughts then). I want to not restrict, but I still want to make at least slightly rational decisions, and I know people with BED have found ways to do all that (Kathryn Hansen said some nice things about how she mostly listens to her body, but if she sees herself making decisions that she know she will not benefit from, she'll tell herself to better not in a way you'd tell a small child something like 'sweetie, three cookies are enough, you don't need the whole box') and it didn't backfire or make it worse.

Last week I focused on 'making peace with food'. Chocolate has been a huge fear food of mine in the past, and I have binged on it when emotional eating or when I've felt guilty about overeating. So last week I bought two bags of Cadbury crunchie rocks (something I usually only buy to binge on when I'm sad!) and committed to finding time each day to eat some mindfully when I was not hungry. Some things I learned:

- I sort of like the taste of them but I actually don't love it! I think if I want chocolate in the future I would prefer a richer, less sweet taste. But I do really like the crunchy texture! 

- That the taste of foods depletes after the first few bites. At first I didn't trust myself to eat the whole two bags in one sitting. But in reality when eating mindfully one or two bites was enough. 

- I want to eat more when I'm not eating mindfully. On a day when I was stressed and struggling to focus on mindful eating I ate a lot more. I actually dont taste them in those moments.

After a few days I felt like I had 'got it' and didn't need to eat them anymore. Then I had a real breakthrough this weekend when my partner bought home some cookies that I would usually overeat. When I fancied something sweet that day I took a few bites but again through eating mindfully realised that they didn't actually taste too good and put them down. 

After having worked through the food police chapter this weekend I realised that there is another big fear food of mine that I need to tackle: butter. I think I had been pretending to myself that I didn't need to do it because deep down I am too nervous about being able to trust myself to eat it. I really love butter and have spent a lifetime secret eating things with loads of butter on because I'm scared people will point out that I'm eating too much. It's also something my inner 'diet rebel' encourages me to gorge on - ""you love the taste just eat whatever you want, f*ck the rules"". I am very nervous about giving myself permission to eat it this week because again I dont trust myself.

Intuitive eating journey during quarantine,4,gvsi0g,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/gvsi0g/intuitive_eating_journey_during_quarantine/,6,"I have had a long history with eating disorders and dieting. Last summer I went on a strict low calorie diet for several months that rebounded into months of binge eating. During that time I got pretty into working out which only contributed to the binge eating. My feelings on binge eating were not like most people‚Äôs (shame etc) rather they were more like wow that was awesome and I did not really have any motivation to stop the behavior. I was just so hungry all the time! Eventually I moved in with My boyfriend and I realized I wanted to establish more normal eating patterns, because it was uncomfortable if I binged that day and then I had to eat dinner.  I really valued sharing meals together so it was important to me to stop. I still had restrictive mindsets around certain foods and I realized that part of the binging was that I just wanted to include these foods in my diet for example cookies. Buying a package of cookies would be triggering so I bought a small to go pack of mini ones and had a few whenever I liked. The package actually lasted me quite some time and I realized the importance of including treats in my diet. 
At the beginning of quarantine I was on a diet but I binged and realized oh no you are not doing this again so I relaxed in trying to eat intuitively. I eat pretty much what ever I like in a portion that is satisfying to me. For example I have protein oats with peanut butter for breakfast, same thing I had on my diet only a bigger portion. Originally I was eating an even bigger portion but my hunger went down so I lowered it again. I do use a measuring cup but not for calorie purposes just because it is hard to eyeball a portion once it is in the pan. Lunch is usually leftovers from the night before a veggie soup of some kind or eggs. I enjoy cooking so dinner is always a home made vegetarian meal.
Every weekend I have pizza and I stick to a x slices. Originally this was so hard after x slices all I would want was more but I wanted to get in the habit of eating normal portions. Eventually my body accepted the fact that ok you get pizza every weekend and it will always be there and now I do not want more. I know part of intuitive eating is allowing yourself what ever you want but because of my binge history I did not think it was healthy for me to eat in large quantities. 
A big thing I have noticed after eating to satiety every day is that my huge appetite has diminished. I no longer feel obsessed with food all the time. Sure sometimes I will get a craving for something but it is no longer the all driving force that it was during my binge eating days. I can buy a package of candy and have it sit in the house for a few days or bake cookies and not feel powerless that I will just eat them all which is a great feeling. My weight has stabilized a few lbs below what it was while I was binge eating and I am pretty happy with where it is at. I do weigh myself daily not for weight loss purposes but more to say look you can eat all this delicious food and it doesn‚Äôt change anything. Sure I could weigh less but it is honestly worth the peace of mind that comes with not having to obsess over food constantly. I enjoy my food but it is not the most important thing in my life.

With the coronavirus still going strong, we couldn't do a big celebration, so we did some landscaping, ordered pizza, and I baked him a half-size cake.

First, I am still frustrated by my oversized appetite. Sweets are one of those things that I overdo on the regular. But I'm also learning to accept it. When there's cake, I'm going to eat a lot of it. It is what it is. I'm not eating past the point of fullness when I eat these desserts, but I still eat an oversized amount of them. It feels like I shouldn't want that much, if you get my meaning. It's not the same as binge eating when I've been heavily restricting, but I'll have some now, then I'll go back and get some more later, then a bit more later, and before you know it, I've eaten a preposterous portion.

More importantly, I discovered how badly eating those foods makes me feel, which is a win for IE. Eating those foods produced an immediate sense of fullness that would fade within the hour, and I'd want more food thereafter. They had no long-lasting satiety. The rush of carbohydrates spiked my blood sugar and then it would immediately drop, leading me to want more food.

I didn't really think about it until it was the evening and I was going back for another slice of pizza, and it occurred to me how *blech* this was making me feel. I felt heavy, full of greasy and salty food, but still hungry. Rather than hitting up the pizza again, I opted for something with more protein and vegetables, and I felt enormously better.

An IE win here: eating food like that doesn't satisfy me longterm, and the rollercoaster of blood sugar swings leaves me feeling unwell. In the future, I can pair that ""fun food"" with something more nutritious to balance it out.",1591104724.0

I have been doing IE for about 7 months now after a most recent bout of severe restriction for a year plus. Since the first 6 weeks in the beginning of IE where I broke all of my food rules, my weight had been pretty much stable for several months. I think it slightly increased from January to March, but very minimally. I was working out in a routine so I was still feeling really great despite any changes in my body. And I felt in control of my eating; it felt balanced, nourished, I didn't feel deprived, etc. 

I will try to summarize what's going on here without taking forever but I probably won't be successful. I stopped taking birth control pill in January before having to go back on the pill to induce a period last month. When I started the pill my appetite became very low, and very little sounded good to me. I also became extremely depressed and got permission from my NP to stop the pill 9 days later. The week I came off the medication I started binging. Muffins, cinnamom rolls, cake. I'm talking a minimum of 4 or 5 ""servings"" of each in one sitting. My therapist sympathized by saying it was comfort food. She knows I do IE although that's not our main focus. 

This medication issue was conflated with the fact that I tweaked my back and decided to take a break from exercise because it seemed to be aggravating it. For about a week I did very little because even walking hurt. The second week I started walking again, now I'm back to walking almost daily. But this is much less than my typical exercise routine which usually involves 2 to 3 physical activities whether it be walking, yoga, jogging, HIIT, hiking, weightlifting, or rugby.

Since the birth control event/exercise break I seem to be binging multiple times a week. I can't shake it.

This weekend I ate so many twizzlers and chocolate bars until I couldn't eat anymore. Not the end of the world. But the pattern is what disturbs me. I seem to be continually eating beyond the point of fullness. My weight gain, which has clearly made a quick jump since all of this began, would be much less of a concern to me if I were respecting my fullness but I'm constantly ingroring my body's signals. Last night after dinner I immediately ate a bowl of cereal out on the front porch of my house. I realized after about three bites that what I really wanted was just the nice quiet time out on my front porch in the sun, not the cereal, but I ate it anyway. Then I get this itching sensation a few hours later to eat a chocolate bar. So I have that too. Before I'm even done the chocolate bar I'm uncomfortably full, but I finish it anyway.

Why am I ignoring my body's signals? I feel somewhat the same way I did when I first began IE, but that was after severe restriction. Before dieting I was always a bored snacker and now I feel like I'm battling that compounded by the fact that I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove to myself that I can always eat what I want by giving myself unconditional permission to eat even past fullness. Like I'm afraid to restrict my food so I choose to err on the side of having too much rather than not enough? But I still don't seem to be getting the picture because I keep binging...I felt like I was over all these issues but a series of events has set me back so far. I eat three meals a day as a base. But I feel overly occupied with food. Nearly anytime I think about, which is often, it I feel like I want to eat just in case I'm thinking about it because I am hungry. My hunger cues are not traditional. Being hungry feels different to me on different days.  It really sucks feeling like I'm out of touch again.  

Has anyone else ever hit a major SNAFU like this after you felt like you had established a healthy rhythm only to have it crumble to the ground? Really looking for some direction. I've been journaling more. At this point I am hoping to find an IE dietician I can get my insurance to pay for because I feel pretty much lost.

TLDR - Successful at IE for months before a couple life events sent me back to a whole new set of issues with over eating. How do I navigate this perceived failure and return to a way of eating that makes me feel good?",1590588383.0

My mood immediately turned, I got really down and sad. I decided to start thinking about dinner and decided I wanted fried chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens, banana pudding and  biscuits (food of my childhood) . I ask my husband what he wants and he goes greek salad. I'm now pissed and really sad. I'm angrily adding a ridiculous $60 cart of goodies to grubhub, going in between pasta dinners, ribs, fried chicken, etc. But nothing really sounds good or worth the money

Then I realize, I'm SO stressed with work that I'm sad and very anxious about returning to the work week on Tuesday AND sad, that if I'm being honest with myself, none of those foods sound appealing and I didn't want them. For lack of a better word it sucked to realize  I'm not gonna get the comfort, i.e numbing of a food coma to cover up these emotions.

So instead I took a shower did my skincare routine and thought about what I really wanted: something crunchy like bell peppers, bread, something fresh and somthing a little sweet. Then I decided If I really want soul food, I can have some tomorrow, it will always be there, and will taste a lot better later. So I requested my husband make his delicious tuna salad, put some bread in the oven and made a smoothie, not gonna get any bell peppers cause we're out,but this is  close enough for me! 

Never before IE would I be so conscious of what I'm  feeling, what would be satisfying or able to cope. I feel blessed. I just wanted to share, no one in my life really gets this everyone is deep in diet culture and my husband is naturally an intuitive eater.

I got super obsessed with fitness and weight loss, followed all the fitness accounts, etc. Never thought I could be lean enough.

I started working towards improvement several months back with a dietitian with an IE orientation and has been a big help. Though I am still struggling. I used to be able to put food down. But now I seem to get full very easily and it becomes uncomfortable. This also makes it hard to tune into my hunger and fullness cues. If I am feeling very full, is it a sign of meeting energy requirements for the moments, or it is due to my stomach shrinking from dieting. I also have a hard time of letting go of being lean and with the idea of weight gain.

Undoing 33 years of low self esteem, self worth and food guilt cycles is hard work but I‚Äôm getting there. One of my big tools, alongside this subreddit that I just found,is Instagram and I started a new account, leaving behind all my slimming world posts and starting afresh. I want to fill my newsfeed with positivity and inspiration, in all different ways (not every post has to be body positive!)

Don't get me wrong, I'm still working on me but I'm working on being happy with who and what I am whilst pursuing all that I want, knowing that my diet, my weight, my clothes size etc. can't define who I am anymore, that I can't live my life saying I'll do X when I've lost X lbs. That I can't keep re-joining the same old diet groups, what is it that they say, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Well I know I can lose weight on these plans, I just also know I can't maintain it. So it's time for something new, something that feels somewhat radical in a way but massively freeing.

I crave something before I'm hungry (or even get a tiny bit hungry) because it sounds good and I plan on eating it later - so I start preparing it, maybe even finish cooking it and setting it aside/in the fridge, and by the time I am hungry and ready to eat, it doesn't sound good AT ALL. I simply don't want it anymore and want something completely different so badly.

Often, I'll just wait until I AM hungry before I start cooking and preparing so I can gauge better what I'd like to eat. But by the time I am finished making it, I am STARVING and often, am not even hungry anymore because I have kind of overridden the hunger-wave which is such a weird thing.

It's so annoying! Last night while I was half asleep on my phone in bed, I saw something about rice and chili and wanted it soo bad, so I planned on making it today because it was in the middle of the night and I was almost sleeping lol. Now, I had breakfast and went grocery shopping and am getting hungry for lunch, nothing of what I bought sounds as good as rice and chili which I still crave so much! I'm getting hungry right now and I will probably start making it quickly now. But it's like, I already almost know that in 20 minutes, when it's steaming hot on my plate, my brain and body will go 'bleh, no I don't want that!'. Often, when I crave several things, I even make the effort of preparing a little bit of everything, but this doesn't always do the trick and I can't whip up several meals in bite sizes just so I can chose like from a buffet :D 

It's confusing me and I have had a lot of dips into IE over the last years, but this has always been an issue for me since the beginning :(",1590229690.0

The trouble is that food doesn't seem to have much effect on how I *feel,* and that makes it harder to eat intuitively. 

I've gone through phases where I've only eaten eggs, salads, protein shakes, and quinoa or whatever, and I didn't feel any different then than when I did when I was only eating cheese, cookies, and dumplings. I have a pretty strong stomach, so I can (and have) eaten nothing but cookies and ice cream all day, and that's the only time I've felt noticeably lethargic (I think I must be descended from milkmaids or something).

I've tried adding more fresh fruits and vegetables to my diet just to see if it makes any difference, but so far it hasn't.

How to switch to an intuitive eating mentality after a lifetime of diet culture and binging tendencies?,6,gn5yc9,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/gn5yc9/how_to_switch_to_an_intuitive_eating_mentality/,8,"I have recently discovered intuitive eating and am now working hard to apply the principles. I'm supporting this by completing at least one chapter of the workbook and am early in my journey (just completed chapter one on rejecting diet culture, and have been trying to apply the principles for about 3 weeks now). There are a few issues I'm struggling with that I would really appreciate hearing from others experiences on: 

1) How to stop subconsciously counting calories/applying dieting rules? Counting calories and thoughts like ""I've [exercised/ate a light lunch/etc] today so am 'allowed to eat x"" are still whirring through my mind. Even if I try to consciously reject them, I feel like I'm just pretending and still thinking in a diet culture way. 


2) I have problems with binging when my mental health is low. Intuitive eating has already helped me to not properly binge in the way I used to (which involved secretly buying and eating copious amounts of snacks I considered 'naughty') but I am still overeating during meals, particularly when the meal is something that I would have historically thought of as 'naughty'. I am listening to my physical cues, can feel when I'm full but still keep eating. I feel like I can't stop myself and my binging mentality just kicks in. I've had several times now when I feel groggy and unsatisfied afterwards, then guilty because I know I've not followed the principle and now feel physically unwell because of it. 


3) I found completing the diet culture chapter very powerful because it highlighted to me how after having spent 10 years dieting, it hasn't worked and has left me with some very deep seated psychological issues. My body image issues are quite severe. I hate having photos taken of me or having big 'life events' happen (e.g. holidays) unless I've lost weight. I feel very bought in to the fact that I need to now reject diet culture for my long term physical and mental health. However, I am getting married in 2021 and my body image issues are still there. I am really scared of not trying to lose weight doing intuitive eating and then having to go through a wedding where I am the centre of attention and everyone is taking photos of me and I feel fat and unattractive. I feel ridiculous writing that down but it is how I feel. I'm worried that my long term goal to build a healthy relationship with my body and food are at odds with this shorter term thing that is happening. I'm not sure I can fix my body image by next year and just enjoy getting married to the person I love whatever size I am. And I think whilst I have I have this tension in my mind it will be hard to truly follow intuitive eating. 


I suspect part of the answer will be to keep working through the book and accepting it's a learning process but would really value hearing from others experiences!",1589955108.0

"""Health is not a moral obligation""",26,gk5r89,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/gk5r89/health_is_not_a_moral_obligation/,35,"Hi everyone :) I just wanted to preface this by saying I've been doing a lot of reading on intuitive eating, and I think it's a fantastic mindset to apply to food! The principles align very closely to my ideas on food and health. I'm not a troll, I swear, just interested in discussion.

All my reading on intuitive eating led me to the HAES movement. I've been researching a lot, reading articles by people like @yrfatfriend, and it's been very educational. One thing I would be interested in discussing, though, would be the idea that you don't owe anyone health - as the title says, ""health is not a moral imperative"".

I'm not sure I agree with this. I don't think people have an obligation to be *dedicated* to their health: if you have bigger priorities in life, that's absolutely okay. But I can't help feeling that some baseline standard of self-care IS a moral obligation. 

For some context, I live in the UK. We have a free-at-point-of-service healthcare system, which means that taxpayers indirectly fund any medical treatment I receive. Beyond that, there's growing global issues around food sustainability and access. I feel that I have a responsibility to take care of my health as best as I can. If I don't have a balanced diet, I'm at risk of malnutrition or other medical issues. Other people will have to pay to support my hospital treatment. If I don't get some exercise, my cardiovascular health will be poor, making me at high risk for heart problems - which, again, other people will fund the treatment for. If I ate loads of meat and fish (for the sake of example), I would have a disproportionately large carbon footprint, and I would make those resources scarcer for those around me.

What it means to take care of your health will vary depending on your situation and your ability. I'm not saying that everyone has to eat kale and run (unless they want to), but it seems that - within the bounds of what is possible for me, in my individual circumstances - I have a moral responsibility to take care of my health *to some baseline standard*. (I.e. eating enough, not wasting resources, getting some movement, looking after my mental health).

If you're struggling right now, just know you're not alone. I thought countless times, ""what's the point."" And I almost gave up completely, went back to the old life of struggle I lived doing the typical diet/fitness plans. 

I'm so glad I never gave up. The healing that's happened because of the book and all the books and online content that have come out after it - mind blowing. 

Some days I wake up and it's hard, other days I wake up and don't even give a thought to my body and food. It just is.

I thought it was just ""being kind of full"".
But no, satisfaction is a whole other feeling I didn't even know I could have.

I have been practicing intuitive eating (and the F\*ck it diet) for a couple of months now and have really started to lean into complete permission to eat **anything** and **everything** in **any quantity** I want.
For so long I was scared I would just not stop eating, but I just decided; you know what, ""f\*uck it""!
And I went HAM.

I ate everything I craved. I ate past fullness a lot and have felt uncomfortably full many times. But I kept eating what and how much I craved.
I definitely gained some weight, but that felt good and safe. I was feeding my body and making the panic stop by lovingly saying: ""see, there is no famine. There is food, and you can have as much of it as you want.""

After two weeks of doing this, I was eating an evening snack and I suddenly felt a feeling I don't remember ever feeling before after a meal.
Such a soft, gentle feeling.
And then it suddenly dawned on me that this is what satisfaction feels like. I felt comfortably full and... satisfied.

wow.

I have never felt this feeling before....

Sure, I have felt full, but *satisfied*?
I don't think satisfaction ever had the chance to enter the chat when guilt, shame, obsessive food thoughts and restriction where hogging the server.

In the next couple of days this feeling kept happening! I would eat what I craved, a nice meal and then boom, all of a sudden; \*ahh\* I''m satisfied.
I can have more later if I want, but I'm just, cool right now.

And I move on.
And don't think about food all that much for the next couple of hours, until I'm hungry again.

WHAT?! How is this possible!? This is wild.
I am so surprised, and am wondering if any of you ever had a similar experi√´nce.

I got my period yesterday. Breakfast was poptarts and a couple cups of coffee. Lunch was lentil tacos. Dinner was baked tofu, broccoli, and roasted potatoes. I had some chocolate pudding with oreos for dessert.

I dunno the point of this. My cramps mostly went away since yesterday and I ate poptarts and coffee again anyway.

The feedback and advice you all gave me has been such a positive force and I can‚Äôt thank you enough! 

I did some journaling to help reflect on why I fell back into dieting and realized something very important. In the weeks before I decided to diet, I was killin it! I was waking up and writing down goals and objectives for the day and structuring my life around meeting the highest goals for myself: career development, creative writing, music, and doing things for my loved ones. My days were filled with meaning and happiness. But then I experienced some burnout. I was trying to do too much, and I had a period of exhaustion. To get out of that rut, I needed a project again, but I was burnt out on all my previous projects. 

So I fell into the easiest, lamest project! Dieting! Especially during this uncertain time, projects are a way to gain control over life, to get that dopamine and motivation flowing, and feel a sense of purpose, that you are moving towards something that will bring you greater happiness in the future. I‚Äôm realizing that this is the deeper reason why I find dieting so seductive. I‚Äôm convincing myself that it actually makes me a better person, and that underlying drive is so damn wholesome and healthy, but dieting is, again, just the lamest and most pointless way of trying to become a better person. 

So I‚Äôm getting back to my real projects, the meaningful and fulfilling ones, but I‚Äôm doing so in a gentler way so that I don‚Äôt burn out again. 

Reconnecting with my hunger and fullness is again a struggle, but in some ways I‚Äôm glad it happened because it has given me more clarity on myself and strengthened my commitment to actually becoming a better person, not a smaller one.

Ethical intuitive eating?,5,gg7zty,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/gg7zty/ethical_intuitive_eating/,16,"I'm not really sure what I'm after here, but I thought I'd post what I'm going through rn and maybe some of you will have some insights.

So I've started intuitive eating about 5 months ago. I used to binge multiple times a week and was either restricting or feel guilty about not restricting.

Now I feel I have learned a lot about my eating habits and am a lot more peaceful around food. I have gained a lot of weight, but my bingeing is down drastically. So many of my ""weakness"" foods have lost their glamour. So lots of positives I'm grateful for.

One thing that I'm having trouble with though is meat. I feel out of control around it and I often stuff myself when it's available. It seems like ever since I started to become mindful of my carbon footprint and reducing my meat consumption, my magnetism to meat has increased. When it's available I need it all... It's weird because at least 3 times a week I'm having a meat (white or read) centered meal... I'd think that would be enough. I dont have an iron deficiency and I eat legumes daily, so I don't think it's a health issue.

I guess I'm struggling to find a balance between being morally upright and removing all restrictions in eating. Does anyone have advice on how to approach this issue? Is the only solution really just cooking and eating more meat?",1588995258.0

Figuring out how it all started for me...,7,ge04bq,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ge04bq/figuring_out_how_it_all_started_for_me/,3,"I just started reading Just Eat It (waiting for the IE book still). It made me reflect on how I got to where I am in the first place. It almost feels like a backwards evolution thing looking back on it now. I think this is TW-free, but let me know.

I ate intuitively all my life, which naturally followed weird ups and downs where I would eat very little for a month or so and then eat ""normally"" the next. I didn't eat in the mornings. This was a thing even when my mom was breastfeeding me, so nothing wrong at all! This continued throughout my early childhood and even turbulent teenage years. Whew! I never had issues with my looks once I managed to accept my womanly body at age 11/12. Never thought about food in any weird way, ever. I ate what I enjoyed, I took pride even in eating whatever I wanted while girls around me went on diets and felt insecure. I maintained my weight no matter how many fries and donuts I ate - I didn't even really understand what all the other girls had issues with at all! This was because I ate intuitively, as I now realize. Food was only ever good to me.

Then at 17 I, for the first time ever, found a sport at school (weight lifting) that I actually enjoyed, that made me feel accomplishment and self-efficacy; I got an A on my reports! I'd always gotten D's or E's in gym class throughout my school years. This was so much fun! A plus was that not ""all the girls"" were doing it (edgelord alarm), and it wasn't a group sport.

I don't know why this really led to a change in my eating. I think maybe it was because I, also for the first time ever, associated with people who did have a focus on diet and nutrition. It somehow managed to influence me. So then I somehow got on the train that I absolutely needed to follow three meals a day. I'd never eaten breakfast before on a regular day, only on weekends and other special occasions. Even then, that usually wasn't until 11 or 12 because we all slept in. I was used to going to school on an empty stomach and then eat whenever I actually was hungry and/or **wanted** food, not because ""it was time"". But now that was going to change. Breakfast, lunch and dinner it was. Every. day.

Big mistake. I started fretting over food. When to eat, what to eat, how much to eat. Suddenly all my pleasure foods (an extra large portion of Chinese noodles and donuts absolutely were an amazing brunch before!) didn't fit in anymore. How could I eat them when I'd already eaten breakfast and lunch, as meticulously planned? I still didn't even care about weight or specific muscle gains, but somehow my issues with food started there. Instead of realizing that this just wasn't right for me, not what my body needed or demanded. I instead focused on the ""issue"" *in me,* because I couldn't get it to work. So I thought, since I naturally wasn't the breakfast type, IF would be for me. Wrong. I mean it definitely matches my natural rythm more closely than 3MAD, but... The control. The control is the issue. So what if I don't make it to hour X one day? The next I may be over that goal. Nope, not good enough. I felt I had to follow IF rigidly, instead of taking the realization that this was a thing that may just be my body's natural rythm to a better place. This caused me so much stress! If this was how my body worked ""anyway"", why was it so stressful to stick to the hours and numbers as instructed? ..Because all that control shit is my issue. So I scrapped that very recently.

My biggest struggle is still the ""should"" of eating, not even the ""shouldn't"". I'll gladly have a hot chocolate with cream and a cinnamon bun for lunch, but only after forcing myself to eat a breakfast that, despite inherently delicious and something that I used to love, just *wasn't good.* Because I wasn't hungry, and I didn't even *want* to eat. I felt that I *had to eat.* What I previously described as my ""binging"" to myself is really just how I always used to eat - very little at times, more at other times. The difference is that now the hot chocolate and cinnamon bun make me feel sick. But that's not their fault. I didn't binge on that lunch. It's because I forced myself to eat something when I didn't need or want to, instead of simply saying ""fuck it"" to that nEcCeSsArY bReAkFaSt I *had to have,* and JUST eating something I want and enjoy later on. I need to cut out the stuff that I feel I *have to have*, not the stuff I *want to have.* I need to lead myself back to a place where I can listen to my body and my mind again, not some arbitrary rulebook in my head.

Having a hard day...,13,gbmkja,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/gbmkja/having_a_hard_day/,8,"Hi all! I'm just having a bit of a triggering day with seeing people working out more during this quarantine. I just recently lost my job last week because of COVID, so I'm at home with my roommate more. As far as food stuff goes, things with her are already a little weird because she is technically the one who introduced me to IE. I had never heard of it before, and was very turned off from it at first. Once I officially started it after reading a lot and coming to my own decision to make the leap, I had more conversations with her and it became very clear that she is still in the diet mindset and she admits she is. The only part of IE she practices is trying to listen to her hunger and fullness cues, but other than that, she practices a vegan lifestyle and claims she still restricts a lot. I can tell, too, because her parts of the fridge and cupboard are very bare. And I get a sense that she eats vegan not for moral reasons but for restriction, because she will eat meat and other things sometimes. Not to pass off judgment and I would never say that to her, but it's just the sense I get. She definitely has a long past of disordered eating and talks about how she wants to do better but hasn't fully committed to to IE. Anyway, this was quite a shock to me because when she first introduced me to IE, I was under the impression that she was actually doing it. But unfortunately that's not the case. She has openly shared her struggles of weight gain and how she dislikes her body, too. 

So anyway... All that to say, I've noticed sometimes I'll hide things from her, like my formerly forbidden foods that I'm working through (cookies, chocolate, etc.). Like I still buy them and allow myself to eat as much as I want of them, but sometimes I'll hide them because I'm scared she'll judge me, especially since she's working through her own stuff. I don't ever really hide my meals, just the snacks. And so I know I have stuff to work through with that. Maybe I need to be openly eating those things or allow them to be in plain sight in order to work through it for my own journey. We do sometimes have conversations about it and she actually is very kind and supportive of me and my journey, so I have no qualms with her at all. But I'm constantly nervous she'll judge me for my food choices, and can see how sometimes I'll think of some of the foods as bad because of that. I still eat them, but the mental part of it can get out of whack sometimes. 

I wanted to give a back story of my situation, to also talk about how now I'm feeling triggered with exercise stuff. My roommate has admitted to having an unhealthy relationship with exercise before, and now she seems to have ramped it up all of a sudden. She's running a lot more and she just bought some workout stuff to do home workouts. The reason this is triggering for me is because I'm having these thoughts of, ""well crap, should I be exercising too?"" and feeling shame for not doing so. Which I know is tooootally my own crap to work through. I've gotten that feeling seeing other people talk about their workouts during this time, and I know others have talked about that on here already. And I firmly believe in each of us giving ourselves grace during this stressful time, that even if we're not being ""productive"", that we just need to be taking care of ourselves in whatever way that looks, and that it's okay to rest if that's what we need. So, I'm only 3 mos into IE, and while some days I've gone on walks and such and genuinely enjoyed them, and even done some yoga, I don't often feel a desire to exercise in the traditional sense, and I still see traditional workouts as triggering for diet culture rather than joyful movement. I'm just still not quite there yet if that makes sense.

Soooo all of that to say, does anyone have any advice or encouragement for me? I could definitely use it. And can anyone speak to how long it took them to get to a place of joyful movement and to where they desired and truly loved it? I realize a lot of this is emotional work I need to do and my recent job loss and being home more has its own added issues. But it always helps me to hear others' experiences!

When this subreddit was first established, it was not as well known and the people on the sub seemed to be experienced intuitive eaters so it sort of regulated itself. I am so glad to see that so many new members have joined us! However, as more people not as familiar with the principles of IE and the beliefs of HAES have joined, more and more posts have been made that could be triggering to people recovering from disordered eating that technically do not break the rules already put in place.

In order to keep this subreddit a safe space, any post made from now on that specifies a certain number of calories or a specific weight will be removed and you will be asked to repost without numbers. You may instead substitute numbers with x's. Ex: (x calories, x lbs.).

Additionally, we welcome people to talk about their experiences adjusting to a changing body but for people in larger bodies, seeing people talking about gaining weight in a negative light can be hurtful. From now on, any posts discussing weight in a way that may be triggering must be tagged with the TW flair, even if it may also fit with another flair.

Also, I have seen a few posts and comments labeling certain foods as bad. This is diet talk and goes against the first rule of the subreddit. Posts like this will be removed.

As always, I am open to any feedback on how this subreddit is run.

Sorry if this goes against any of the sub's rules; this is my first time posting and it's so niche I wasn't sure how to Google it.

I started really looking into Intuitive Eating at the start of the semester, and it was going really well! I was living on a college campus where I had access to dining halls and my own stash of snacks in my room. I was able to pay close attention to my hunger/fullness cues, and I felt like I was learning a lot about my body's signals and preferences.

But then, of course, fast forward a few months, where I'm now finishing my coursework from home since our school kicked everyone out as the virus spread. I find that I eat more erratically now, and that I'm less ""in control"" than I was before. It's more than just having snacks within arm's reach. I'm fairly certain that my sense of food insecurity comes from living with a sibling who often finishes certain foods or drinks that we needed/wanted for later without letting me know. When we eat, I tend to grab seconds even if I don't need it in the moment, because I'm ""afraid"" of my sibling or parent taking it all. It almost feels like I'm hoarding because I anticipate the food not being there the next morning.

It sounds ridiculous and is incomparable to actual food insecurity, but I don't know how to convince my body/mind that it's okay for me to lose out on another round of food/snacks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky....‚Äù,68,g6hrui,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/g6hrui/youre_so_lucky/,9,"Just in a bit of a reflective mood at the moment, I hope that‚Äôs ok.

When I was in the beginning of self awareness with my eating disorder, I used to get so angry with the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so lucky‚Äù comments.

They always ended with some version of ‚Äúyou have a great metabolism‚Äù 
Basically any way to say that I had nothing to do with my weight.

I got a bit fed up and started responding with ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my metabolism, I don‚Äôt actually eat‚Äù

I realise now, that I wanted some recognition and appreciation for how hard I worked to be that size.
The energy that goes into restricting is overwhelming and I wanted recognition for that!

But not only that, I now realise the disconnect between bigger and smaller.

If you are bigger, or fat even, that‚Äôs all because of you! It‚Äôs all your fault that you can‚Äôt lose weight, that you are bigger, that you don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúself discipline‚Äù to weigh less.
But once you are smaller, all of a sudden, it‚Äôs because of your metabolism or genetics.

So which one is it? I‚Äôm still the same person, even though I‚Äôm bigger. 

I‚Äôm in the process of deconstructing my beliefs around beauty and body size, and I find it interesting how society makes these decisions about people based on their size. Not just decisions, but judgements. 

I‚Äôve been smaller, and I‚Äôve been bigger. I‚Äôm still the same person. My outward appearance bears no real indication of who I am, except for maybe my religious jewellery. 

The biggest thing I‚Äôve realised, and this has been the most difficult for me, is that I am guilty of this myself. I look at people and make judgements based on their size. It has taken me a long time to be able to even admit it to myself that I am part of the problem. I take solace in the fact that now that I am aware of it, I can take steps to change it.
I can acknowledge that I am working from the programming I had growing up in a female body in this society, so can cut myself some slack there.

Now, when I look at someone, mostly other woman, I look at the variety of shapes, sizes and I wonder who she is as a person, is she happy? What makes her happy? 

I look at people now, and I see people. That sounds absurd I know.

But it has taken me years to see myself as a person. A human being worthy of love and respect, and an individual with my own likes and dislikes. Not just something to make other people happy, or less uncomfortable, and through learning to see myself this way, I can see others like this too.

I never realised that fixing my relationship with food would lead to so many self discoveries. It‚Äôs pretty hard going at times, but so worth it.",1587623889.0

First Day,7,g5zm5n,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/g5zm5n/first_day/,8,"So today is my first day of eating intuitively. I was a very very thin child and come from a family of thin people. I started dieting even thought I did not need to (basically out of comparing myself to others) and wrecked my metabolism. Before I started dieting, I first gained a little weight when I stopped playing sports. If I‚Äôd continued eating normally and incorporated a healthy workout routine I‚Äôd have been fine. I went down a roller coaster of diets, manly low carb, which wrecked my body and mind. The last I ate intuitively was when I was abroad for a semester in college. I was so happy and actually lost weight without trying. As soon as I got back to the U.S.  I gained it all back. I try to control my food when I‚Äôm unhappy / bored in other elements of my life.

I was over it. I was full after like 2 bites and the granola didn‚Äôt even taste that good, even though I thought it did when I binged it. I also think the act of pouring the granola into a bowl and sitting down to it as a meal made such a difference. Before I‚Äôd eat little crumbs out of the bag and try to hide it, but probably ended up eating more than I did today. 

I know this is gonna be a long process and I‚Äôm literally in my first meal but I find this very interesting. Is this a normal feeling? Does anyone have any advice?",1587555692.0
IE and transness,24,g5qc3l,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/g5qc3l/ie_and_transness/,9,"I don't know if there are other trans people on this sub, but I'm transmasculine myself and I find it soo difficult to reject the diet mentality. 

The peak of masculinity/androgyny these days (for transmasc peeps especially) is having a jaw and a muscular body. I've actually seen trans guys justify their fatphobia by saying that they couldn't be fat because it would make them dysphoric?? So instead of realising that you can be fat AND trans, they perpetuate thinness as a beauty standard and include it in their transition goals. I'm sick of seeing them say ""Wanting to be thin is just a personal preference"". It's never a personal preference when it includes stigmatising a group of people. 

Have any of you dealt with that? How do you get over these injunctions to be thin and to diet?",1587512123.0

Learning a lot and feeling better about my eating than for ages, maybe ever. This is my first time posting here.

I'm wondering, is there anyone else here with ADHD (/ADD)? It may seem like something that shouldn't have much to do with IE, but some of the symptoms of ADHD make being mindful and present very challenging! And symptoms include impulsivity, a tendency to either go ""all in"" with a pleasurable thing like eating or forget about eating altogether if you're distracted by something else, difficulties in processing emotions (if I feel an emotion, I'll feel like that emotion is everything, forever), poor planning, and being prone to stress (and thus stress-eating). All of this is complicating intuitive eating a bit! Also I'm afraid that once IE loses it's shiny novelty, I'll forget all about it.

On the other hand, listening to my internal cues instead of trying to build a constant routine or practicing rigorous self-discipline sounds perfect for someone who loves variety and has a strong aversion to strict limits and boredom.

So are there any adhd'ers here? How do you stay present and attuned to your body's needs? Do you think there are upsides to eating intuitively with ADHD?",1587246377.0

I realized something weird today. I actually miss that out-of-control feeling binging gave me (not going to lie, although I've eradicated the restriction pretty well so far, the binging is still definitely there, but I'm still missing having more frequent/bigger binges). I keep returning to binging because to me it's like the ultimate defiance of responsibility; like, ""I don't give a shit about trying to honor my hunger or whatever! You can't tell me what to do!"" And like, I know where it comes from, too (dysfunctional family, had to be perfect and maintain control over everything or all hell would break loose, so it makee sense that I enjoy not having to have self-control sometimes) but I don't know how to stop. 

It's just, like, committing to respecting my body and eating intuitively 24/7 is exhausting. I feel like I have to be perfect about it or else I'm not recovering, and sometimes I need a break. So I binge out of frustration/feeling triggered by my past.

The number one thing I noticed is that I had *zero* mental hunger all day. I wasn't hungry when I woke up, so I had some coffee and broke my fast closer to noon. After that, I had a small lunch a few hours later, and then a small dinner later. I simply wasn't that hungry, physically or mentally.

From my years of calorie-counting, I know for certain that I ate at a caloric deficit, but I also didn't want more food. I also noticed that I had zero carb cravings: no desire for bread or fruits or processed anything. All my carbs yesterday were vegetables.

I came home and hit the gym with a passion- I was excited to have time to work out and prepare for my CPAT (firefighter ability test), and I was waking up at 4 or 5 am to get to the gym when I was alone, and I was meticulous about triple cleaning everything, and washing my water bottle/clothes/phone when I came home.

There are lots of old habits being stirred up, but I feel I'm doing really well. Some things that have happened since coming home 

\- No GI issues from the college food. nuff said.

 \- nearly absent stomach hunger signals, I usually have a voracious appetite, but lately it's been silent. This makes it hard to eat without feeling like I've eaten ""too much"" because my other hunger signals (brain fog, hand shakes, food thoughts) are still present much much more subtle.

 \- finally gotten to eat home cooked, family meals again, not rushed process food I grab from class to class.

 \- I can enjoy my love of baking and cooking again 

\- after a nice little rest since the gym has closed, im enjoying other movement. As a 4 year long cross country runner, I grabbed my sneakers and hit the road for the first time in months, and just like I remember, it is not that fun. I think I'm still holding a grudge with running as it played a big role in my ED. but I've enjoyed movement like yard work, bike rides, family walks, balance training, and using the weights and resistance bands in my basement to continue strength training. this will greatly benefit my squat mobility as I think one of my hips is stronger than the other . I've even progressed to 2 fingertip pull ups! 

\- I've gained a little weight and I don't mind, I think I look great in my bathing suit. 

\- I am forgetting about candy and cookies, in my house, in quarantine. this is completely new for me. - I'm getting much better at not focusing on good/bad food, but I still struggle with mentally tracking calories. It's improving.

Putting food back,30,fvr5fx,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/fvr5fx/putting_food_back/,5,"Something that has really helped me with IE is the idea that I can always put food back if I realize I don't truly want it or I don't want to finish what I've put on my plate. As I work to become a more intuitive eater, reject diet mentality, and grow to trust my body, there are still times when I feel myself eating on autopilot. When this happens, I let it happen, but always tell myself that no matter how much or how little I've eaten, I can always put it back in the fridge/pantry/freezer at any point. This helps me with the ""all or nothing"" mentality that exists with dieting as well as the clean-plate club/not wasting food part of my brain. The little voice in the back of your head that says ""well I've screwed up my diet, might as well binge all this ice cream and start again tomorrow"" or the one that tells you, well you've put these chips in a bowl and you're not going to let them go to waste! I can't tell you how many times I've done that while not even really wanting all that ice cream yet forced myself to finish it :( 

For example, since I started IE, I have been buying reallllly yummy expensive ice cream and it has been such a treat to eat it whenever I want. Today, while on autopilot, I made myself a bowl. I took one, maybe two bites, and a voice popped into my head saying ""hey, I don't \*actually\* want this ice cream,"" so I just... put it back in the freezer so I could truly enjoy it when I was craving it. Every time I listen to that little voice, I feel my intuitive eating muscle getting stronger. 

I don't know if this makes any sense but it has been a huge help for me. Sure I have ridiculously small amounts of foods in tupperware all over my kitchen (and maybe some bites of sandwiches in my fridge...) but it has been a breakthrough tool. It just soothes my brain to know, yes, you can come back to this when you want it. You don't have to force yourself to finish and be uncomfortably full. I am so much happier for it. Also, I love finding random bites of candy in my pantry :)",1586142877.0

I'm having these REEEALLY intense cravings all of a sudden, specifically for sugary beverages and fruit-flavored candy.

Funny enough, the way this all got started was I got a prescription in the mail, and they had added a single Starburst to the package with my meds. This set something off in me, and I've had Starburst on my mind for DAYS. I'm seriously craving sugar the way you crave water after exercise. I have a sweet tooth, but I don't even normally eat much candy. I also chugged two big bottles of orange juice in a week, whereas I normally only have one.

The funny thing is I'm not even binging like I normally do in stressful situations. I normally find things to munch on all day long, but lately, I haven't been eating much at all. I guess it's just a classic case of wanting what you don't have, and other than candy, my kitchen is fully stocked.

I know this is the least of our problems right now but I had to get this off my chest (and low key I'm fishing for coping/food stocking strategies, haha).

Feeling Guilt & Shame about Appetite/Hunger,23,ft43q6,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/ft43q6/feeling_guilt_shame_about_appetitehunger/,3,"Hi, Friends.  Lately I have been feeling rather guilty and slightly ashamed for how much I have been eating. It's no surprise that with everything going on in the world that my anxiety/depression have been surfacing in both new and recognizable ways. A coping mechanism of mine was to count calories obsessively. I've finally made progress in IE (been giving it a go for about 5 months now) that I don't track my eating, even in my head. However, I ate a lot of food the other day and felt super guilty about it. So my mechanism kicked in and I calculated how much I ate compared to how much I exercised, etc. The weird thing is that the amount I ate was almost exactly the same amount recommended based on the amount of activity I had engaged in. Kind of wild that my body is that intelligent! But the main thing is that I just wish I didn't feel compelled to see if the amount I ate is ""appropriate"" for the amount I exercised at all. I just need to check in with how I feel and remember that guilt and shame are not productive emotions for me in general as I usually apply them to inappropriate situations/things just to make myself feel bad. Yet I have still been having thoughts about my body, about how it has grown a bit since starting IE, and about whether or not it will stop growing. I have been tempted but I just can't step on the scale because I know where that will lead me. Main lesson here is that my body is smart and I shouldn't feel guilty for being hungry or eating more than usual because I was particularly active one day. Thanks to anyone who read through this whole rant! Just remember to reflect upon yourself when possible and be kind to yourself if you accidentally engage in some unhelpful coping behaviors. Try to forgive yourself and treat yourself kindly. And reach out to friends, family, etc. if you are feeling lonely or need to refresh your perspective. I hope you stay well :)",1585761858.0

A good reminder about subtle restricting from your past,37,frgrhj,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/frgrhj/a_good_reminder_about_subtle_restricting_from/,2,"I have been doing this about 9-ish months, it would be a year except the first few months I kept going back to dieting. 

Anyways, it's probably been a good 6 months since I got past the first stage of eat all the things, but every once in a while, a new thing comes up that reminds me why intuitive eating is so important, and that sometimes our history with restriction isn't super obvious.

I was not an overweight child or teen, so my earlier restrictions from my parents weren't based on dieting to lose weight, but eating less than I wanted (or differently) because of not having enough money. 

In today's instance, it was because of a food I wasn't allowed to eat. My stepdad used to get those Hostess oatmeal creme pies, but it wasn't a ""kid snack"", so we had to stay out of them. I LOVED THEM, and always had to restrict them. 

As an adult, I haven't really gotten them much, so it's been years since I had them. When I went grocery shopping, I got a box because they sounded good. And surprise, surprise, definitely have not worked on my relationship to this particular food. Because less than 24 hours later, and the box (of 10 or 12) is almost gone. 

Like I literally cannot stop thinking about them. I keep getting up to get another one, now that I'm allowed to. 

It was just a good reminder to me that until you work through every single food you had an issue with, you're still going to go through these moments where you feel like you're out of control for a while. I imagine after a few boxes, I will be over it.

Just as a bit of background, I counted calories in the past, lost a bunch of weight, then started practicing IE about a year ago. I gained all the weight back, and then some, but for the past couple of months it's been stable.

I recently had a death in my family, and the day I found out, I ate an entire pint of ice cream in one sitting. I was obviously upset, but also very stressed out trying to decide whether I should fly home or not for the funeral (ultimately I decided to not go). Then I ate two more pints over the next few days. Then I bought three more this weekend, and I've already finished one!

Food is basically my main emotional coping tool. I've been mostly ok during this whole thing, but I'm really worried about my family who all gathered for this funeral. I've had a tense, fluttery feeling in my chest, and it *only* goes away when I indulge in something delicious.

For now, I've just decided to try to judge myself or worry about my eating habits as little as possible. Every day I indulge on sweets a little bit less. I figure the more I lean into it, the sooner I'll get bored of it, and the more I worry, judge myself, and restrict, the more I'll eat.

Moved joyfully for the first time!,35,fjz7ew,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/fjz7ew/moved_joyfully_for_the_first_time/,3,"My relationship with exercise has always been as disordered as my relationship with food. As a college athlete, exercise (in this case, running) was a second job, and I slowly lost my love for running long distance. After I graduated from college, running and exercise became a transactional process, where food was my loan, exercise was the way I paid it back, and calories was my debt. It was so exhausting and i was tired of forcing my body to move in ways I hated. 

Another reason I hated exercising was the pressure to burn the calories to get to that abstract ‚Äúcaloric deficit.‚Äù I would constantly be checking my Garmin watch to see how many calories I burned and where my heart rate was. If my watch didn‚Äôt work, then the entire workout was a ‚Äúwaste‚Äù in my mind. My anxiety would spike because I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to know how many calories I burned. 
 
I‚Äôm 2 months into my journey, and I haven‚Äôt exercised once until today. I was (and still somewhat am) over running and hardcore cardio like I used to do. But tonight, I was experiencing some intense cabin fever due to the Coronavirus and I was tired of being cooped up. So...I decided to try out a Zumba belly dancing video! And I did it without my Garmin watch! It was fun and stress reducing and a MUCH harder workout than I anticipated, but more importantly, I felt joy while moving. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve written off running or super intense workouts because there‚Äôs still many elements that I love with this type of movement.

Crazy food night,17,fidjki,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/fidjki/crazy_food_night/,5,"Had a crazy experience tonight, but got through it and learned a lot. I was going to a friend's house to hang and was craving Chinese for dinner, so I ordered Postmates to be delivered to my friend's house once I arrived. It estimated about 45-50 minutes so that's what I planned on. I get to her house, and about 30 min goes by and it still hasn't arrived. I then notice on the app that the est time isn't changing and that there's been some sort of error. At this point I am HANGRY. We call the restaurant and they never received the order... My God.

So we call in an order to another place down the road. Have to wait 20 minutes. Get there and the place was packed and chaotic. At this point I'm so ravenous and frustrated and stressed. I was literally scared that my body would think I was starving it.

We get back and I dig in... Only to get full a few minutes later. So crazy. I was just way past hungry and I hadn't honored my hunger much earlier in the day due to running errands and being too busy when I got home before I headed to my friend's. Just a recipe for disaster.

All that to say, I couldn't have anticipated the situation, but it was definitely a different feeling than I would have had before doing IE. Before, I would have been hangry I'm sure, but wouldn't have felt the flood of emotions that I felt tonight, along with this sense of fear and annoyance that I couldn't just eat. I also wouldn't have noticed the immense hunger signals as much and probably would have just ignored it. Not to mention my friend, who is pretty steeped in diet culture, didn't seem phased by eating so much later. Maybe she was full, but it just didn't seem to bother her that we had to wait so long. So I felt a bit alone in that I guess...

Anyway, not sure why I shared all this, but maybe just to say I may often find myself in circumstances I can't control around food, especially when I tried to plan something out. And that can be emotional and hard. But I just have to breathe through it, have grace for myself, and make sure I can feed my body as soon as possible. Whew.",1584163192.0

Early pregnancy wins & fails,2,fi7vw0,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/fi7vw0/early_pregnancy_wins_fails/,2,"Trigger warning: food tracking/vigilance; weight talk

A bit of background: I've been trying IE for about 2 years now with mixed results. The absolute greatest benefit has been in terms of mindset and body acceptance. But I still have guilty thoughts about weight loss every now and then, especially as my weight has never stabilised.

My concern about constant weight gain is moot now because I recently found out that I'm pregnant! It's been an interesting ride with food so far. 

On one hand I've been trying to make sure I'm getting enough nutrients to grow a healthy human, which means I've reverted to focusing more on food (for vitamins and minerals rather than calories). I feel ok about this at the moment but I can see the potential for foods to become ""good"" and ""bad"" and becoming obsessed with getting enough of this or that nutrient. Of course there are also foods that I'm not supposed to eat like soft cheeses, wine and too much coffee üò≠

On the other hand I've been paying more attention to my body than ever before. The result is being able to really give my body what it wants and put things aside if I don't feel like them or if I'm full, while at the same time allowing myself to have a burger or some chocolate when I want it. In a way I feel like my IE has levelled up.

I realize the logical thing to do would have been to get rid of them as I gained weight, but alas, all I did was tuck them in storage bins. Now I have three bin-fulls of clothes and a lifetime of emotional baggage sitting next to them. 

I started going through them to list on Poshmark, and I didn't realize how emotional this process would make me. I'm trying to view it positively (having more space in my closet, investing in clothes I love now), but it's hard to let go of them emotionally. I guess I was holding on to them with the hopes that at some point I'd naturally lose the weight over time. Does anyone have tips on how to get through an emotional closet clean out?

"The problem is not that you binge eat, but that you are prone to binge eating in the first place",80,fffoio,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/fffoio/the_problem_is_not_that_you_binge_eat_but_that/,19,"A lot of shitty anti-binge advice on the Internet is like ""hide your trigger foods"" and ""breathe and count to ten,"" but they don't ever focus on why the person is prone to bingeing in the first place.

Hiding your ""trigger foods"" or doing OMAD aren't ""cures for bingeing."" That's like saying that avoiding elevators for the rest of your life helped you get over your fear of elevators. 

In order to stop bingeing, one has to get rid of their desire to binge in the first. And in order to that, one must remove any and all restrictions. Conditional permission to eat and fear and judgment around food (and lack of sleep in some cases) are what make humans binge in the first place.

So last night I worked an evening/closing shift at the restaurant I work at and because it was so busy I wasn't able to eat anything for my 8 hour shift besides a few bites here and there. When I do ally got home I ate a lot of food, like a bowl of pasta several slices of toast, chocolate and went to bed feeling bad. 

Instead of beating myself up this morning when I realized that I'm hungry I made myself a large bowl of porridge ignoring the fact that I had this really large late night meal. What I ate last doesn't impact on what my body needs right now. 

Also I realised that I've been thinking of eating a lot of food as bingeing and that being a bad thing, but since I've been eating intuitively I've not 'binged' sure I ate a lot on a short amount of time but I didn't feel out of control, of course I would need that amount of food, I'd just done a full days work on next to nothing!

My IE Journey,15,fevwq2,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/fevwq2/my_ie_journey/,11,"I've never actually talked about my journey through IE at all! I am excited to share. 

First of all, I have tried nearly every single diet or type of diet out there. And some, I enjoyed the options of food I had and I felt ok. But there was always that element of restriction in the back of my mind. I felt like it was a little itch that was driving me crazy. 

Then I heard about IE. And I laughed a little. ""Oh sure, this must be for the sorts of people who waltz through life somehow remaining societally ideal and perfect, all without effort!""

But it wasn't! I noticed many different kinds of people did it. And I wondered if I could too! I came of course from a past of constant dieting, but I was so so tired of it. So I started IE. 

In the beginning it was a little scary. All the foods I hadn't been ""allowed"" all the quantities all the times of eating... It seemed crazy. But I started to actually feel MORE in control after a while. I was worried I would feel out of control, but to me dieting all the time felt less in control. 

After a while, the urge to vacuum up junk food has lessened. This really surprises me! I love chips and candy and stuff! I just find myself not desiring them. 

What do I want now? Vegetables.... I don't get it! But it's turning out differently than I thought and I am enjoying myself so much more now!

A few years ago I ruined my relationship with food, confused my hunger cues, when I tried ""keto"" and then a slew of other diets, because I felt fat and ugly and wanted to lose weight quickly. I didn't lose any weight but I did develop an anxiety-ridden restrict/cheat/shame cycle with food.

I haven't finished the book yet but when going into the grocery store, I've been mentally saying ""You can literally get whatever you want in the entire store"". It's scary to give myself that kind of freedom. At first I mainly wanted copious amounts of bread and butter, but I didn't restrict and just allowed myself to eat what I was feeling like.

After a week or so it started to balance out and I generally feel like eating normal balanced meals.

It's only been a month but I don't crave sugar like I used to. Since I know I can have whatever I want, I can walk by the cupcakes and other sweets and be like ""they look pretty but meh, not in the mood right now"" which is an amazing feeling.

They were asking if anyone else deals with a low key sadness or emptiness when food and dieting are taken away. I really resonated with that...

It's both refreshing and difficult to start feeling your actual feelings. Those moments of clarity are so weird...like oh, I don't want this chocolate right now, I *want* to want it.

I have had so many feelings come up as I've gotten deeper into IE. I noticed that I eat from boredom.... Not regular boredom, but an existential boredom; I realized that I settle for boring jobs that aren't challenging enough. I noticed I eat from distraction so I don't have to deal with grief or fear. I noticed a BUNCH of insecurities pop up that I didn't even know I had, that I was avoiding through commitment to diet culture and the cult of self improvement.

I have started therapy, even though it has been a big financial stretch. The wonderful thing about therapy is that it helps us speed up and deepen insight. I still think you can do so much with a few good books and good friends.

Has anyone else experienced this, and how do you deal? 

These are my coping mechanisms when I encounter the feelings under the eating and diet culture (pardon the formatting, on mobile):

-I reread The Fuck It Diet, which has some helpful journaling prompts!
-I try to meditate sometimes, which is difficult for me, but calms the mind.
-I reread Tara Brachs *Radical Acceptance*, which is my all time favorite introduction to insight meditation and self awareness. Very down to earth, wonderful read.
-Something that has helped me is...hear me out... Using a feelings list. I have a habit of using a few blunt tools to describe my feelings (mad, crazy, tired...) Now I use a feelings list. It's actually liberating to realize I feel disappointment, anxiety, concern, etc.
-sometimes I eat! Because eating something when you're feeling feelings (good or bad) is allowed and ok!... Getting over the anxiety about DOING IE RIGHT had been an important step for me.",1583410883.0

I've been a long time lurker in tons of subreddits and just discovered this one. I first heard about intuitive eating on Instagram and I'm very much intrigued by it but not sure where to begin. I couldn't find any FAQs or something so I hope some members can help me.

The thing is, I have a history of binge eating (without purging) and have dieted on and off since high school without much succes. I'm a 26-year old female and first lost a significant amount of weight in I think 2016/2017, when I went from over 90kg to 70kg. Since then, I've gained some kilos and lost some kilos and struggled with binge eating.

I'm kinda OK right now in terms of bingeing, mostly thanks to the Brain over Binge book and podcast. But I still don't like my relationship with food - it just doesn't feel natural. I always overthink things. Even without being, it's always either loads of veggies and protein or only snacks and white bread with peanut butter and zero nourishment.

Now that I've stumbled upon intuitive eating, I'm wondering how to start and anxious to have a bingeing relapse. Because if I start this journey and I get binge urges and I stop myself from bingeing, am I still restricting myself? Or doesn't that count?

I took my first steps into IE independently, without really knowing that I was doing it. This time last year I was finishing a PhD and working part-time. I was also going to the gym, trying to keep to a given number of calories (and usually not succeeding, even though it was a number that most dieters would consider *very generous)*, and putting lots of energy into keeping on top of my diet.

At some point I realised it was all too much, and that something had to go on the back-burner if I was actually going to finish the thesis. So out the window went my diet (I kept going to the gym for the sake of my sanity), and I pretty much subsisted on packets of biscuits and Indian takeaway for a few months -- things I would normally eat occasionally, but kind of considered ""forbidden"" foods that I wouldn't eat if I was being ""good"".

**Diet fatigue:**

I put on a fairly significant amount of weight, but after a few (4 to 6?) months realised that eating like this all the time didn't make me feel good. I wanted vegetables! Yogurt! Non-chocolate desserts!

A big part of me wanted to go back on a strict diet, but it just wouldn't stick. So I committed to not worrying about calories or macros, and focusing instead on eating health-promoting foods (i.e. fruit, veg, and not-sweet-things) in satiating amounts. I was still doing it with weight loss in mind, if I'm completely honest, as the plan was to start reducing my intake once I'd improved my overall nutrition, but the experience of eating well and eating enough felt SO GOOD.

And this is where I read Intuitive Eating.

**Reading the book is important:**

For me, the most impactful part of the book was the piece around the ""last supper"" mindset --  something I had never come across when reading about IE online before.

In my heart of hearts I believed that I needed to give up sweet things in order to eat ""normally"", and so any time I ended up wanting them and eating them it seemed like it might be last time I'd ever get to have them. And so I'd overeat. Then I'd try to ""reset"" the next day, and maybe succeed for a couple of days, but then it would happen again and again and again. What a terrible cycle!

It hasn't happened in the last 3 to 4 weeks, though.

**Learnings:**

* When I eat to satiety and know that I can eat again if I'm hungry, the sweet things lose their allure. I've had a jar of dark chocolate raisins in my bag for the best part of a week, where before they'd all be gone in half an hour (and I'd be feeling terrible)! I can buy a handful of protein bars if they're on offer and not worry that I'll eat them all on the bus journey home! It's so outrageously freeing!!!
* I like to eat a good amount early in the day, contrary to most dieting advice. Eating enough in the morning/early afternoon means that I'm not fixated on food and snacking between meals, and I'm not STARVING by dinner. In fact, I seem to like a smaller dinner, which is again something I'd never considered.
* Calorie limits do not work for me psychologically. To be honest, until recently I related a lot to people with BED. I would eat a ""good"" number of calories at breakfast/lunch/dinner, but I'd compulsively sneak biscuits at work or keep on eating chocolate after dinner. Or sometimes if I was alone in the house I'd eat three protein bars (or granola bars or bowls of cereal or other things I ""shouldn't"") and hope that nobody judged the wrappers in the bin. IE has freed me of this in a way that calorie counting never did.
* It's so wild to me that I have legitimately never considered my hunger/fullness cues as a good measure of what to eat before! Until now it was all about eating a certain number of calories for breakfast/lunch/dinner, and never mind if wanted more or fewer -- that's what I had.

**I promise this is nearly over**

Obviously this is just my experience, and yours may vary. 

There is a lot of fear -- and you'll see it very obviously on some of the more... uh... hateful subs -- that listening to your body will inevitably lead to eating donuts and drinking frappuccinos all day (I don't know why these are always the examples). For me, it's been quite the opposite, and it's amazing to feel in sync with myself rather than battling against my body's signals all day every day.

In restrospect, I was \_hungry\_. I just didn't know how to recognise that.

**tl;dr I like intuitive eating and it has been a good force in my life.**",1582973069.0

Do you track or food journal?,7,f7f042,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/f7f042/do_you_track_or_food_journal/,15,"One thing I have really resisted since starting IE was any kind of tracking or food journalling.  I had previously tracked my food daily for close to 3 yrs in MFP and all of my previous diets had involved some kind of tracker and I was just done with tracking.

&#x200B;

But...lately I've been thinking about doing some kind of journaling.  Here are the reasons that seem to keep coming up:

&#x200B;

1) I have been feeling a bit ""off"" lately and am wondering if my diet could be fueling me better (i.e. more consistent veggies, higher-fiber carbs). A journal might help me to sort out if my diet is actually ""lacking"" anything.  I am a little concerned that my orthorexic tendencies might kick in though, and I would suck myself back into a loop of trying to have ""perfect"" healthy eating days (which almost invariably would wind up being lower calorie).

2) I've had several days of feeling out of control with eating in the past few weeks and each time it seems to be tied to lack of sleep.  I wonder if having a journal could help me tap into that awareness before I start eating in a way that leaves me uncomfortable and unhappy. 

3) My life has just generally been quite out of my hands for the past month (health issues and finally a minor surgery to repair them) and I kind of want to feel like I'm the one in the driver's seat again (rather than my health condition!).

I've decided that I will keep this up unless I notice the presence of ""fun"" food seriously interfering with his consumption of more nutrient dense food (by which I mean, I'm not going to worry if he leaves a few carrots uneaten one day, but if he refuses all vegetables for a week, going to have to rethink.  Hasn't happened yet).

So, he's old enough now that we can do some cooking/baking together so we've been enjoying that once a week or so.  This past weekend, we made cupcakes.  We made mini ones as I figured a mini cupcake would be an appropriate size for a lunchbox treat during the week.  The night we make the cupcakes, of course he wants one for dessert.  After he finishes he says he's still hungry and would like some apple.  Next few days, he gets a cupcake in his lunch.  It gets eaten.  He doesn't bring cupcakes up at home at all.  Seems to have forgotten they exist.  Then last night he requests a cupcake after dinner. I'm feeling tired so I tell him he can climb up on his step and get the container out of the pantry himself.  So that's right, I've just kind of given my kid unfettered access to cupcakes.  He gets ONE cupcake out, then comes over to the table and says ""I want this one now and the other for my lunch tomorrow"" (okay, turns out we were down to our last two cupcakes to I guess he was not being given \*that\* much access).  

The whole thing was so eye-opening to me, like a real affirmation that IE does work and is how we are naturally meant to eat.",1581016085.0

I get this feeling a lot, especially in the evenings after dinner, where it seems I'm not actually hungry, yet I feel a sensation in my stomach similar to hunger, like there is a tiny little pit in it.

I've been responding to it as I would any other kind of hunger sensation and got myself an eggo waffle with some PB, hazelnut spread, syrup, a glass of milk, and some trail mix. I was definitely full afterwards. 

Am I overthinking this or what? Because I'm pretty great at overthinking things. When I was dieting I would ignore the feeling and suppress it. Now I am still placing a lot of emphasis on not restricting, so I respond to it like I would any other hunger cues. But I ate a solid dinner of breaded porkchop, broccoli, and a baked potato, and plenty throughout the day. 

I know that I'm not really HUNGRY, but it's like my brain is sending signals to my stomach that it wants to eat rather than vice versa.

A full fridge - game changer!,24,euie0y,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/euie0y/a_full_fridge_game_changer/,4,"I've been restricting and binging for years and am now diving deep into IE, what a game changer!!!

I'm coming to realize that one of the reasons why I've binged on foods is that I kept no food in my house. I'm a 35 year old woman and my fridge looked like a 20 year old's bachelor pad - a couple of condiments and milk for coffee were the only staples I reliably kept on hand. I would buy about $25 of food every week on veggies, maybe crackers and cheese, yogurt, nuts and then go full binge on interesting food combinations depending on what was in the fridge. Ex: yogurt with maple syrup and jam and just gobbing it on there as that's what I had for the week. Not very satisfying or filling. 

I started the book and went to the store and bought a  bunch of food including restricted foods. I continued to binge off what I bought and it felt out of control. I ain't gonna lie - definitely felt guilty after binges but continued to read IE literature and examine the ways that shame and guilt of food will do nothing to serve me post-binge.

Yesterday I went to the grocery store again and loaded up on a bunch more food, including restricted foods. I binged again but afterwards had a revelation that was pretty empowering. 

I realized that I never have to have an empty fridge again. I can afford whatever food I want and have the luxury to get everything my heart desires, and I want to continue feeling grateful for this. And what a full fridge signifies and has helped me understand is that there is no reason why I need to binge on the foods I had previously only bought on occasion or the very limited food I kept on hand as they are now plentiful in the house. 

My mind thought that the expensive trip to the grocery store was a one-time deal when it's not, I will be buying and stocking my fridge so that it's full of food at all times. I don't have to go to the pantry a million times a day to see if delicious snacks will magically appear or binging on the one box of crackers I allowed myself to buy as they will always be there, and plenty of it!! I am starting to accept that there will be no food shortages or restrictions of food moving forward. 

Wowwww, that's pretty big for me, my weekly shopping trips are now gonna look so different! I'm still having issues with feeling guilty when eating unhealthy foods when I'm not hungry (had a few Reese's peanut butter cups today), and am working on listening to my body's cues of hunger, satiety and fullness but this is a major step forward. I can now focus more fully on my internal cues while knowing there is plenty of food in the house. I will also continue to push myself to not judge my food choices and use self care when I do binge. Still a ton of work to do but this is exciting progress. Woot!!",1580097216.0

I tell myself 'its just this one time, I deserve to indulge', but it is happening a lot more frequently than I would like to admit. It seems like I eat to occupy myself.

It has gotten to the point where every time I am bored, I can feel myself salivating and I start to crave so many different foods. While eating, I have a hard time picking only one thing. It seems like I am never satisfied, so I keep grabbing different things. I always want more.

In a weird place with IE,16,enx5ck,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/enx5ck/in_a_weird_place_with_ie/,8,"Trigger: weight gain/lose talk 

I started loosely intuitive eating in late summer of 2018 when I got pregnant with my third baby. I‚Äôd been thinking about it for awhile and decided to more or less start when I got pregnant. It was more of a hunger/fullness diet because I wanted to eat healthy while pregnant, but it was good for me because I didn‚Äôt worry about my weight gain at all. It was a more peaceful pregnancy then my others in that regard. I did restrict some. I know that‚Äôs not true IE, but it was a start. After I had my baby I stopped restricting and allowed myself free reign of everything. I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself. I‚Äôm still kind of in the eat everything faze, but I think I‚Äôm starting to come out if it. I‚Äôve gained weight. My face is fatter. My clothes are tighter. 

The other day my husband bought a hunting camera, so he set it up in the living room to test it out. My kids loved it, and of course I was walking back and forth, taking care of my 9 month old. When my husband looked at the pictures I was shocked at how much I‚Äôve gained. I immediately got upset and started thinking about what diet I should go on. Then I remembered several things. 

One, I‚Äôm fed up with dieting. It doesn‚Äôt work for me. I restrict, restrict, restrict, fail, binge, restrict again, only to lose and gain the same few pounds over and over. When I started thinking about what I could do, I just couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt make myself do it. 
Second, I want to learn how to eat like I was born to do. And I want to model healthy eating for my children. I‚Äôve always struggled with diet related guilt, body image, and all the stuff that goes with that, and I don‚Äôt want them to go through that. By learning how to eat intuitively, I can keep encouraging  them  to eat intuitively so they won‚Äôt have these struggles.  
Third, I‚Äôm healthier then I‚Äôve ever been. Yeah, I might weigh more then I ever have, and I might wear a bigger size then I ever have, but I‚Äôm healthy. I rarely get sick. I eat well. 
Fourth, I‚Äôm breastfeeding my 9 month old. I‚Äôve kept another person alive with my body for 18 months. That‚Äôs huge. And my body always hangs onto weight and wants to gain while I‚Äôm breastfeeding. In the past I had to work HARD and risk losing my milk supply if I wanted to actually lose weight while breastfeeding.

How can I stop the cycle of eat til I'm stuffed, hate myself, feel like a failure, repeat?

&#x200B;

Making peace with food means that no food is off limits (for weight loss reasons, at any rate.  Obviously if you have a deadly allergy to something, continue to avoid it!).  When a food becomes ""forbidden"" its appeal increases and ultimately you are more likely to binge--either on the forbidden food, or on a ton of other substitute foods.

&#x200B;

When no foods are forbidden, they lose that special status that make them extra appealing and you can make more rational decisions about when and how much of them to eat.

&#x200B;

This chapter discusses different kinds of backlash against forbidding foods, such as Last Supper eating, food competition, returning home syndrome, and others.  Do you feel you have been prone to any of these?

&#x200B;

How successful have you been and making peace with food?  Do you think something is still holding you back?  Have you maybe made peace with some forbidden foods but not others?  What has your making peace process looked like?  Have you followed the five steps outlined in the chapter?",1576451037.0

Suppressing hunger tends to increase interest in food.  This chapter starts by laying out some of the science behind that, which I am not going to summarize in much detail as I will probably massacre it.  That's why you should read along :)

Honoring your hunger sends a powerful signal to your mind and body--it allows you to feel confident that there will always be food available.  

Some long time dieters may have silenced their hunger.  Do you find you are susceptible to any of the silencing examples mentioned in the chapter?

Some different examples of physical hunger symptoms are given.  How does physical hunger manifest for you?

There can be different kinds of hunger too, not just physical hunger.  

Finally, the chapter concludes with a study whose results suggest that eating in response to hunger improves both health and weight.  Have you found this to be the case for you?  How far into your IE journey were you before you felt this to be true?",1576210027.0

Principle 1 (Chapter 5) is all about rejecting the diet mentality:

""Throw out the diet books that offer you false hope of losing weight quickly, easily, and permanently. Get angry at the lies that have led you to feel as if you were a failure every time a new diet stopped working and you gained back all of the weight. If you allow even one small hope to linger that a new and better diet might be lurking around the corner, it will prevent you from being free to discover Intuitive Eating"".

Some things to think about/discuss (feel free to discuss anything else in the chapter also!):

There are four ""steps"" outlined to rejecting the diet mentality: recognize the damage that diets cause, be aware of diet mentality traits and thinking, get rid of the dieter's tools, and be compassionate towards yourself.  Did you (or do you) find any of these steps particularly easy or challenging?  Why?

Do you sometimes find yourself engaging in forms of ""pseudo-dieting"" discussed in the book?

The book discusses how dieting can be a way of bonding with others socially, do you find your relationships with some friends, family, or co-workers have changed since you have stopped dieting?",1575850688.0

But what I've been afraid of finally happened: The kids started shaming each other about their snacks. One little boy was eating two granola bars. A kid next to him yells over to the other tables, ""\[Billy\] just ate 27 grams of added sugar!"" Everyone laughs.  I ended snack time early to pull the kids into a classroom and talk to them. 

I told them that the information from their nutrition classes is to help them understand what can help our bodies grow. It is not for making yourself or others feel bad about what they eat. It's none of our business what other people eat, and it's not our place to comment on it, ever. I told them that they were all healthy, energetic young people, and that eating something sweet didn't change that. We spent some time talking about all the amazing things they could do: swing on monkey bars, do somersaults, do layups, jump rope, build structures with paper, figure out difficult math problems... I tried to keep things positive. 

I really think I nipped it in the bud, but this is such a tricky thing to teach to kids. They're very concrete, and I worry that some of them will start to stress about what their parents are giving them to eat. Luckily, the health teacher talks often about how nobody eats ""perfectly"" and that it's okay to enjoy things that don't have a perfect nutrition label. It's just hard to be around sometimes because I'm trying to move away from judging every food choice I make. 

There are also all these new posters about obesity and pre-diabetes hung up in the break rooms. I can't help but feel like my lunches are being scrutinized now. GAH.",1575681027.0
picked a candy without judgement!,15,e716rm,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/e716rm/picked_a_candy_without_judgement/,1,"hey all! i've been pretty busy with exam prep recently (most of my more recent reddit time has been mindless scrolling in the name of procrastination) but just wanted to pop in to share something that happened to me this morning.

this semester i've been taking an entry level genetics class. we're wrapping up the semester by talking about natural selection. my prof had us do an activity where one half of the room got to choose a candy they wanted from a bowl and the other half had to pick one blindly out of a bag (essentially showing how certain traits like bad taste can lead to increased survival in a population).

i was in the group that got to pick. in the past, i'd have flipped out and probably given my tiny candy to someone else. instead, i picked one (a starburst) and moved on with my life! my prof even had extra candy at the end of class that we were allowed to grab if we wanted. i picked up one piece of chocolate almost without realizing that i did, just because there was no thoughts yelling at me that i wasn't 'allowed' to eat it. i got to enjoy it on the bus ride back to my dorm :)",1575650811.0

Eating Out with IE,6,e72r0c,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/e72r0c/eating_out_with_ie/,5,"Hey all. Just kind of writing this out to get it off my chest and realize that it's not a big deal/reaffirm that everything is okay. 

I've been doing IE just over a month. Still really new to everything, but I already feel soooooo much more sane around food. It's a great feeling!

However, today I had a bit of anxiety/panic when I realized I will be eating out 3 times in two days. Twice today -- boss bought us lunch, and then we have an office holiday party at a nice restaurant later. Then tomorrow I'm meeting my dad to buy him lunch for his birthday. 

Once I realized all this I kind of started to panic and feel like it's ""bad"" to eat out so much because eating out ""will make me gain weight."" I normally don't eat out very much. Maybe twice a month. 

But these are special occasions! It is okay for me enjoy and celebrate these special occasions with my coworkers, friends, and family. I don't need to feel guilty about eating out/having rich foods. I am allowed to feed and enjoy myself without guilt. In fact, I should enjoy this absolute abundance that I have to fortune to experience. I'm lucky to be able to share these experiences with people. And I can't wait to order dessert after dinner. Which honestly, I will do even if I'm full. Because I want to!

The Power of Mental Restriction,23,e6mcma,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/e6mcma/the_power_of_mental_restriction/,3,"I had an \~interesting\~ experience last night that I thought I would share. 

For context, I am coming from a long history of anorexia and disordered eating. Most recently, I fully relapsed with anorexia last year. I have since weight restored and have been trying to eat intuitively since August. 

The past few weeks, I've been struggling with accepting my weight restored body, and the restriction thoughts have been really loud. Yesterday evening, I ate *a lot* in one sitting. I'm hesitant to call it a binge as I didn't feel out of control, but I was in a bit of a ""fuck it all"" mind set. I realized this morning as I was beating myself up for my perceived overeating that it was triggered by the ""last supper"" mentality. Last night I was feeling really down about my body, and was passively planning/considering to reinstall My Fitness Pal and to go on a slight caloric deficit so I could lose just a few pounds (lololol). And that was enough to trigger somewhat of a binge episode, something I haven't experienced since the summer when I was still bingeing and purging and restricting and trying to lose weight.

And honestly, it was a great reminder that I am on the right path. Sure, I could diet/lose weight, but I would end up in the same place. Better to stay here and move forward.",1575574841.0

- post meeting I had a cookie I brought from home and a clif bar which was a substantial amount of calories.
- lunch was a corn fritter w/ halloumi and avocado and some brocolli and carrot sticks 
- post lunch I ate another cookie and a piece of Xmas fruit cake from the earlier meeting and drank a bit of soy milk.

This is also my first ever own post on Reddit.

I started intuitiv eating a couple months ago after dieting my whole life (I'm 36 and did my first diet at the age of 14). I'm just tired of constantly hating myself for being ""fat"" and lose 10 lbs with any diet (I did them all) just to gain 15 lbs after ""failing"" the diet.

Intuitive eating seems to be the way to go. The first weeks were great, I was sick at home and had major success - no binging episodes, I ate things I really wanted and it was easy to stop after feeling full.

After going back to work I failed again. I work in an office (8+ hours a day) and do customer support. I absolutely love my job, but it's really stressfull and hard sometimes. At work I just don't have time to eat slow, listen to my body and follow the ""eat when hungry, stop when full"" rule. I'm always in a hurry. Sometimes I can't go on a regular lunch break and have to eat on my desk. I don't listen to my body, I just eat with watching the clock or even work. And when I have a really hard time, I eat sweets and chocolate all the time without even being hungry - and hate myself so much after that I find myself crying in the restroom.

It seems I just don't have an idea how to deal with stress and little time to eat. Do you guys have any advice? I would be so happy... THANKS for this amazing community. You guys are awesome. 

tl;dr - IE works fine at home, when I have time and can focus on me and my body. At work I totally fail and eat mindless even without being hungry, don't know how to deal with stress, little time and pressure.",1575380140.0

Here's the problem. Over the course of the day, I packed away probably 6,000 calories or so. Possibly more. But then I got hungry again later that evening, so I had a bit more. On previous Thanksgivings, I would eat until I was in physical pain, but fortunately that didn't happen this year. On the downside...if I ""eat intuitively"" like this on a regular basis, it's not going to be good for me. I would like nothing more than to have some sweet potato pie right now, but if I allow myself to eat however much I want, it's going to have a negative impact on my health. My wallet, too.

I could eat every bite of food in the building, even if I wanted to eat ice-cream and waffles for every meal, eat an entire pizza, or the whole tray of French fries. I ate beyond fullness a few times. I felt guilty for a while. But, intuitive eating won. I don't really crave any type of fried food, and I don't eat dessert often. The endless chocolate milk isn't that good. the pizza isn't great. I wake up early for the fresher, yummier breakfast options. I make sure I get to the dining halls before the salad bar and the station with more whole food and vegetable options close. I haven't even tried some of the food options this semester. But, if I want something that's being served, I can try as much or as little as I want.

Some things to think about with the intro chapters:

1) Diet backlash: how have you experienced it?

2) Do you identify with any (or more than one) of the eating personalities described in Chapter 2? Do these eating personalities help you to understand what underlying triggers are driving your relationship with food and dieting?

3) When reading the overview of the 10 principles, are there any that you feel you already practice?  Any that stand out to you because you think (or have found) them more challenging to implement?

4) Of the five stages of IE described in Chapter 4, where do you think you currently fall?  Do you find you move back and forth between stages?

And of course, anything else that comes to mind as you read these chapters is fair game also!  Happy reading and discussion.",1575220447.0

I decided to go full force into IE 2 years ago, but ended up mostly binge eating again because I was being ""free with food"". I was also going through a deep depression which fueled my eating.

I'm in a really tricky situation and wanted to ask for your input. I'm transmasculine and lucky enough to currently have insurance that will cover lower surgery, something that I desperately need to address my dysphoria. Because this surgery is very inaccessible, maybe about 12 surgeons in the US perform it, and two of them are in my insurance network (one somewhat close by, the other on the opposite side of the US). As you can imagine, waitlists for getting a consult and surgery date are very long! I started the process of getting on the consultation waitlist over a year ago with the surgeon closest to me (three hours away) and now have a surgery date for stage one (of three) next summer. The issue is, he is requiring that I lose a relatively small but not insignificant (10-15 lb) amount of weight and will cancel my surgery if I don't demonstrate that I'm losing weight. I currently work with a IE/HAES oriented dietician and therapist for mild-moderate binge eating/EDNOS. We're all at a loss for dealing with this situation, and so far I have been trying to keep my eating patterns relatively stable while exploring joyful movement/exercise. This has been lovely but not helped with this ""goal"", and my binge/restrict episodes have become more frequent, which I have been open with my care team about. Sometimes I feel like I might have to choose between addressing my dysphoria or my eating disorder, which is very distressing. I've talked to my surgeon about this and while he's sympathetic, he's firm on the weight loss requirement. Both of the surgeons in my insurance network require weight loss, and while there are surgeons who are more weight-flexible outside of my network, I'm not sure I can successfully petition for them to be covered under a one-time agreement (plus I'd be starting over with the waitlist). This surgery is extraordinarily expensive out-of-pocket (think hundreds of thousands), so that's not really an option.

The level of delusion would be kind of hilarious if it didn‚Äôt cause so much pain for so long. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize how much I was suffering until I started experiencing this new kind of happiness that exists independent of how I look or am perceived by others. It‚Äôs like getting out of an abusive relationship and finally feeling free and loved by myself for the first time. It prompted me to re-examine my views on happiness and truly learn self-love. Some non-food related things that have changed: 

-Started discovering more of my own genuine interests. I didn‚Äôt realize how much my ‚Äúinterests‚Äù were shaped by how I wanted to be seen. I‚Äôve given up on trying to shape myself to be what other people want me to be and am giving in to all my desires and following my bliss. It feels so good.

-Had my first orgasm with a partner. I‚Äôll be honest, I have faked every orgasm to this point in my life because I didn‚Äôt think I was worth the effort it requires to please me. I realized that the amount of clitoral stimulation I need is actually pretty normal and I simply taught my partner how to do it for me and he was more than willing. I feel so stupid for wasting so much time not being genuinely pleasured.

- The biggest thing is that I don‚Äôt really identify my ‚Äúself‚Äù with my body anymore, which is liberating beyond words. When I‚Äôm at a party, I‚Äôm not thinking of what I look like or what other people think of me. I am participating! I am focusing on bringing joy to others, and the entire experience is infinitely more joyful. 

In short, how I perceive myself, my happiness, and my presence in the world has really been transformed, and it all really started when I started questioning why I would rather be skinny than happy. There have been so many tears along the way. It has been hard to convince myself that I truly do deserve to be happy and it really doesn‚Äôt matter how people perceive me, but it has been everything to me. 

Im super grateful for all the wisdom and support from this community. I don‚Äôt know any of you personally, but just knowing that there are so many others on this journey with me is encouraging, and I hope that you all get the happiness you deserve out of life.

"A Cautionary Tale - I restricted, then I went crazy!",21,dxpf33,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dxpf33/a_cautionary_tale_i_restricted_then_i_went_crazy/,5,"I struggle with acne and migraines. At my last doctor's appointment, my doctor recommended I try limiting dairy (particularly cheese) because dairy can exacerbate acne and (aged cheese, at least) can trigger migraines.

I've been a lacto-ovo vegetarian for years and am very happy with that lifestyle. (So I eat eggs and dairy, but no meat.) I also try to limit dairy already to plant-based alternatives, and have considered trying to eat more plant-based for ethical reasons. 

But, hearing this, I had this weird idea to become completely dairy-free. I thought I would be healthier, and as much as I tried not to focus on the weight, I did think that maybe I would get very svelte going plant-based. 

Things were, and are, a bit complicated. I cut out dairy for a few days, and my skin did get better. I didn't have any migraines. I was eating delicious food. I was learning how to cook vegetables in a different way, and using a new app to look up new recipes that also had a nice grocery list feature I really liked. I was happy. But, after a while I really started to miss cheese and dairy. Although my doctor even encouraged me to limit, not cut out entirely, I was stubborn. I continued to eat plant-based foods. I started eating more unhealthy plant-based foods when missing cheese. I was not happy.

Then, I decided to go back to eating cheese to see if there was any difference. 

I ate - and overate - pizza 4 times in two days. I had large quantities of cheese on crackers. I ate lots of dairy-filled desserts. All because, I realize now, I was worried that if my skin and/or migraines got worse, I was telling myself I wouldn't be able to eat these foods again. So I better go nuts now!

Luckily, that craziness only happened for about 3 days before I really realized what was happening. I told myself that I would continue the lacto-ovo thing and increase the amount of delicious vegetables in my diet. And I'm trying to get back towards eating intuitively, but it has been a real challenge. 

Have my migraines and acne gotten worse? Interesting question. No migraines to report, but some minor headaches since eating dairy again. But, to be fair, the food was extremely nutrient-low and full of salt, etc. I was also overeating and not hydrating enough. I was also going through an extremely stressful time at work. The acne has gotten worse too - but I've also started tretinoin which is notorious for causing breakouts for a month or two before leaving you with better skin (I used tretinoin as a high schooler and had this pattern happen). 

So I am doubtful that the dairy in and of itself was causing this.

Things I learned: 

1. Restricting doesn't work
2. Be very suspicious when you tell yourself you are doing something for overall health and not skinniness/a crash diet in disguise. Really take time to think about it.
3. I do really like eating some dairy-free meals. Vegetables sometimes taste better without being cooked in butter or other rich dairy additives. Who knew?

2 Months In,30,dx05fq,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dx05fq/2_months_in/,11,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm two months into this process today. 2 months since I last binged and purged and decided I was going to stop restricting and unwind a 20 year relationship with an eating disorder. 

Last year I did a 4 day water fast, went into keto, went to Peru in May and starved in the Jungle for 2 weeks, tried carnivore in August for 10 days, I lost a good chunk of weight, and also lost about half my hair. I kept thinking the next ‚Äúdiet‚Äù would fix me. It was the gluten or the sugar or the dairy or the toxins or I just needed to have more willpower.

Sometime in the summer I decided to stop weighing myself. And then after a lot of deep self work, I realized that my body was trying to tell me to stop restricting. 

I listened to a hundred podcasts. 

I read The F*ck-It Diet. I‚Äôve been learning to honour my body‚Äôs need for rest. I used to competitively powerlift now I barely want to set foot in a gym. The gym can wait.

It started with piles of cake, ice cream. Chocolate. I‚Äôve gained weight. It‚Äôs been bloody hard. I bought bigger pants and granny panties.

Today is the last day of my period. I‚Äôm knackered from work (I‚Äôm a psych nurse). I worked a split shift. I walked for approx 40 mins today, cared for my friends‚Äô cats and my cat. I ate some ice cream and lindor balls in addition to lunch. I ate some more lindor balls. I made a serving of cake batter and just ate it. I‚Äôm knackered. I‚Äôm full and I know I need to rest but
my brain is screaming for more sugar.

I feel admittedly gross so I‚Äôm typing this out. I think I‚Äôm also thirsty. I‚Äôm going to try and sit with myself a bit longer before eating more. There is a voice in my head telling me I‚Äôm failing and that I should go to the gym tomorrow. There is a voice telling me to binge on the lindor balls so they aren‚Äôt in my house anymore so I can ‚Äústart fresh‚Äù. I recognize these are old voices, but feeling full and fat makes this challenging and painful.

I sure hope this gets easier. I‚Äôm struggling with this process today.

Thanks for reading. I‚Äôm grateful to this community as it gives me hope.",1573867235.0

I'm not enjoying this chocolate, I'm not enjoying this act, this feels like something I'm forcing myself to do because it's how I have historically reacted to this kind of situation.

i've been dealing with some imposter syndrome lately, particularly with IE. i haven't been eating super intuitively recently, particularly because of my health issues. food became more of a convenience thing (or making myself feel less sick after i had a massive blood draw lol). there were parts of me that were saying ""hm, how can you mod an IE group when you're not even eating intuitively??"" and other parts that were yelling that i'd ""fallen off the wagon"" or ""failed IE"" somehow. 

after a while though, i realized that those thoughts sounded pretty familiar. they were the same sorts of things i thought when i was struggling on my diet. it's like my brain had repurposed those same phrases to be used against me now with IE. 

the thing is, though, none of those thoughts are true. that's what i love about IE and why i think it's so sustainable. it doesn't require you to be perfect, it just needs for you to try. like the title says, you can't fall of a wagon if it doesn't exist. i will admit that i have been lurking the sub a little and i feel so happy when you guys share your victories and i feel for you when you describe your struggles. remember that it's more a process than an end goal. not to sound like high school musical but we're all in this together!!

in short, i guess, i just wanted to apologize for my absence and let you all know that i've been rooting for you guys :) i'm trying to get myself out a bit of a rut so i'll see if i can't mess around with some mod settings over the weekend just to give myself something to do.",1573830496.0
IE is helping me confront my food and weight obsession. A smol rant about my family,5,dwxsqi,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dwxsqi/ie_is_helping_me_confront_my_food_and_weight/,2,"It seems like every time I see my mom I learn more about my relationship with food. 

I moved across the country about a year ago, so I only see her a few times a year now. When I saw her for the first time in a while a couple of months ago she pointed out that I gained weight. Then she pointed out that my dad lost weight. Then she pointed out that she has to ""be good"" and get back to the gym.

My parents visited me last week, and the same thing started up again. She didn't comment on my weight, but she did keep bringing up her own weight and also commented on how one of my siblings lost weight. My dad went out for desserts pretty much every night of his visit and she felt the need to point that out too. I called her out on it, and she said: ""blame my father"" (he's always been critical of her weight and women's weight in general). 

My mom has struggled with her weight her whole life, and by ""struggled"" I mean has been in diet mode for as long as I can remember. She's recently had the revelation that ""food is not the enemy,"" but she still restricts in ways she's not aware of and I see her constantly going through mini binge/restrict cycles.

(She's also Catholic and gives up sugar for Lent so... you can see that this moralizing/guilt shit goes deep.)

Then just today, she randomly texts me to say that she took one of my siblings out for doughnuts but ""I'm just having tea :)"". This is after multiple conversations we've had about how I don't want to talk about weight, I don't want to police food, and she repeatedly claims she's stopped moralizing it.

It's just so bizarre to me that she has this compulsive need to talk about food ALL THE TIME. At the same time, though, I totally get it, because I picked up those behaviors from her and used to be the same way. I even, shamefully, realized that I've been picking at my boyfriend about his weight gain over the past year. I finally realized I was doing that, and how hurtful it is, and cut that shit out.

I'm SO grateful I started down this IE path because, without it, I never would have realized how much I obsess about food and weight. Because I've started eating intuitively, I'm able to get some distance from these negative thoughts and behaviors.  I'm finally able to confront them, and I'm finally starting to let go of this obsession.",1573855896.0

Journey to IE + My Experience,5,dwmn16,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dwmn16/journey_to_ie_my_experience/,1,"TW: talk of mental health + disordered eating patterns (but I promise it has a happy ""ending"")

I'll be honest, I never actually thought intuitive eating would be for me. I have been going from diet to diet since I was 9 years old, having always been overweight and a mega binge eater. When I was 11, I developed bulimia and spiraled hardcore all the way into my teens and early twenties (where I am now), developing severe anxiety and depression along the way.

During all this, I counted calories and points. I burned off what I ate with exercise. I gave every single food I ate a moral value - ex. celery is ""good"" and cookies are ""bad."" I spent countless hours of my life measuring my food by the gram. I restricted for days just to end up bingeing and hating myself in the end. For all this effort, I gained and lost the same 10 lbs over and over again. 

Finally, this year, I had a bit of a meltdown after one of my latest (and last) diet attempts failed. Not only because I gained back all the weight I'd lost, but because I was just sick of everything. All the calorie and carb counting, all the punishment-exercise, all the self hatred. I was honestly at the point where I was laying on my bed, having a panic attack with tears streaming down my face, wondering what was wrong with me, why couldn't I just look like those beautiful (photoshopped, able to afford personal coaches and trainers) celebrities I admired so much? I punched pillows and kicked and screamed and was so frustrated and upset and felt like I couldn't breathe. 

And I finally just decided that I was done. Snapped, just like that. I didn't have the energy to continue dieting anymore. I just said ""Whatever, I give up, I don't care if I lose weight anymore and I'm going to do what I want."" Following that was about a month of bingeing on whatever I wanted and not exercising. I had occasional guilt, but I ended up shrugging and saying ""I don't care anymore."" Of course I gained weight, but I didn't care. I was so sick and tired of thinking about my body and how others viewed it and thinking of food and exercise and numbers all the time. I would have rather been morbidly obese at that point in my life than count another calorie.

And then.. I naturally just started gravitating towards more nutritious foods, and I stopped eating past bursting. My body wanted to exercise, just not the aggressive two hour long punishment sessions as before (and I found forms of exercise I actually enjoy and look forward to doing). If I wanted a food that I used to consider ""bad,"" but now just consider ""less nutritious for me,"" I just ate it. I had my fill and I moved the heck on with my life. I stopped counting calories and tracking my food intake completely. I ate when I was hungry and stopped when I was full. I exercised when I had energy and rested when I was tired. This ended up mostly curing my binge eating disorder on its own. I had no reason to binge since I was allowing myself to eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted without repercussions.

Now, this is not to say that the diet mentality and guilt and self judgement doesn't pop back in sometimes, but I can rationally dismantle it and do what's right for me, what my body wants or needs. By doing so, my body is slowly going in the direction of a healthier BMI. 

These days, 19 lbs down by letting my body breathe and do its thing, I only weigh myself occasionally to see where I'm at in my journey to health. I view the numbers simply as data points instead of whether I get to eat that day or not. I would like to be a healthy weight, but a healthy weight that is natural for my body and my lifestyle without my life being a string of diets and misery. It became all about my health and happiness and not about the aesthetic or how attractive I looked to others. If I overeat one (or more) days, I don't stress or try to ""make it up."" I just listen to my body and I don't try to tell it what it wants, it tells me.

I didn't know that intuitive eating was just listening to your body. I'm not sure what I actually thought, but I do know I viewed it as a severe lack of control, which was something that used to terrify me because I lacked control over my own eating habits. After having my own experience and somehow gravitating towards people who are just like me, I found this beautiful community of people who have broken free and are much happier and healthier than ever before. People who eat for their body and soul, and are healing. 

I'm honestly happier than I've ever been, and I feel a huge sense of relief having finally let go of diet culture and trying to force my body into a shape it doesn't naturally belong in. Whatever my body looks like, now and later on in life, I accept it. As long as I'm happy, I'm okay.",1573798457.0

How success with IE has played out in my life.,40,dvw42c,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dvw42c/how_success_with_ie_has_played_out_in_my_life/,7,"I‚Äôve never shared my full IE story, but I feel like it‚Äôs a fairly successful one. Many posts on the IE subs are those in the midst of frustration, and I wanted to post my experience to maybe provide a little light at the end of the tunnel for those of you struggling (especially around the holidays!) I‚Äôll preface this by saying I am not some intuitive eating zen Buddha with a perfect relationship with food. I have bad food and bad body days. I am just an average, open-minded woman trying to find meaning in this world like the rest of you. 

My story starts in childhood where my average body was made to feel shame (multifaceted, but combo of ballet, parents and the wealthy, superficial community in which I was raise) that lead to almost 2 decades of binge/restrict style eating. More importantly, food hijacked my emotional and spiritual life. This was at its worst in medical school when I would fast, juice cleanse, keto, you name it, to stay below a certain weight. Being thin was always correlated with freedom in my mind - freedom to do and be and say what I wanted. It was also a classic trap of ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù with which I was deeply obsessed. Spoiler alert: I was never free, and I never had it all, even at my lowest [dream] weight. It was never enough. 

When I became a resident I gained weight, and all my tricks were to no avail. One last run with keto to fit into a bridesmaid dress the week after intern year, followed by a massive binge full of shame and agony at the wedding was the final straw. I signed up to see my nutritionist the next day. 

That was 2 years ago. In these past 2 years I have been through every phase of the IE journey (or so it seems) - eating everything, eating nothing, only thinking about food, slip ups with restrictive eating, mourning the loss of my body and control. Above all else, intuitive eating forced me to come face to face with my biggest fears (mortality, lack of fulfillment, regret) because I didn‚Äôt spend my precious hours on this earth obsessed with looking up keto recipes. It has made me a better wife, daughter, sister and friend. It has helped me find peace with the messy and nuanced person I am. It has truly, deeply, set me free. 

I gained some weight on this journey. I had to buy a lot of new clothes. Even more so now as I am in my second trimester of pregnancy. My body works for me. It works out when that feels right. It also runs around a hospital most days and heals. It carries a child. It laughs and cries and cooks and cleans and provides. It is my vessel in this life. Food is meant to serve it. I think about food when I want to eat and when I want it for comfort or satisfaction. I overeat, undereat and all things in between. I eat fast and slow and just right. I just eat, without having to think and think and think. This is the true gift that IE has given me. The hours of this one precious life I have.

Good luck and happy holidays to anyone struggling. This journey is long and hard, but so so worth it.",1573670479.0

Here‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned about myself: 


IE has helped me realize that I can‚Äôt eat too much grease at any one meal or my stomach feels upset and I feel bad. This doesn‚Äôt mean I restrict foods, it means I eat what I want but certain foods I only eat up to a certain amount. More on how I got here and how I‚Äôm still learning!...


Pretty early on in my IE journey I realized I can‚Äôt eat too much bacon at one time. If I ate too much then I‚Äôd have an upset stomach all day. I have settled on 2 pieces in one meal being my limit. That‚Äôs what I found works for me (but believe me there was A LOT of testing this personal limit). 


My next step was having a realization about breakfast (a specific meal type from restaurants). When eating out I love(d) going for a corned beef hash and egg dish (so good!). The first time I ate this meal after starting IE, it was the last day of a trip and my stomach got upset. I thought, hmmm, maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve eaten out for several days in a row. After that, I ate the same type of meal again and felt the same. Then I thought, okay, it might be the food. Of course I tried a third time because I really had to prove it to myself (ha!) and came to the same conclusion. All different restaurants but all made them too greasy for my stomach to handle. Thing is, when I make it at home, I don‚Äôt have any issues. I now have a policy to not order this at restaurants because I won‚Äôt feel good so I order something else that I know will taste good and keep me full. That‚Äôs not restriction, that‚Äôs honoring my body. If I ever want to enjoy this food I can make it home whenever I want. 


The latest installment of this was just yesterday. I made myself a grilled cheese sandwich. It was so tasty with pepper jack and cheddar cheeses and you bet I buttered that bread to get a nice brown on the outside. I had that for breakfast and in just a few hours I got that familiar feeling of an upset stomach (no fun). When I made the sandwich I hadn‚Äôt even thought of the greasiness of all that combined (I put A LOT of cheese in that sucker, haha).  Moving forward I am going to experiment with how much is too much. I will try less cheese, I will try smaller bread, etc. I am not going to cut grilled cheese out of my life because that‚Äôs not what IE is about and we all know that. I am going to find my limit and honor that moving forward.

I actually have always used her workouts, even during the years I was dieting. I just love her personality so, so much.

The best part is that she pretty much never mentions a workout ""burning fat"" or losing weight. She is pretty against it, and in every video I can remember, she focuses on being fit and strong and healthy. That's it. If she has a fat burning workout video, that might be a bit of a TW, but honestly I can't think of even one time she said a workout is going to help you lose weight, or mention weight at all.

Old sub back up...? What‚Äôs going on?!,7,dreujo,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dreujo/old_sub_back_up_whats_going_on/,2,"After being abruptly shut down, the old r/intuitiveeating has suddenly reappeared! 

I feel genuinely conflicted... the last sub was starting to get really active, with more than 5k subscribers. On the other hand, nothing in the way of active moderation. 

This sub feels like it‚Äôs off to a great start, and I hope this doesn‚Äôt derail things. There are so few places to go and feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in the diet culture madness that can be reddit sometimes.",1572856465.0

Also unfollowed all the diet and weight loss subs and Facebook groups. Deleted the fasting timer apps, the MapMyRun app (was all about calories, not maps, for me). 
Just put cream in my coffee because I love it.
It‚Äôs amazing, now that I have this awareness, I feel like I‚Äôm so much more aware of how pervasive diet culture is. But knowing it‚Äôs bullshit, it doesn‚Äôt induce an emotional reaction - it‚Äôs just like, PASS. And then I carry on. Liberating AF.",1572796140.0
r/eatingintuitively sub ideas!,8,dr8xun,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dr8xun/reatingintuitively_sub_ideas/,2,"hey all! i'm so happy we were able to make this new sub after the old one got so unceremoniously shut down. now that we actually have an active mod (thanks u/beverlynotbev!!) maybe we could come up with some ideas for the sub? (i'm obviously not expecting all of these to be implemented right away but it might be a good place to brainstorm and maybe figure out a direction we want to take this sub in the future!)

i was thinking it could be helpful to have some sort of sidebar/faq where we can link information like the IE book, TFID, podcasts, websites, or whatever. that way newbies who come to the sub can have a starting point and some guidance. it also might be cool to have user flairs so we can show how long we've been doing IE! same with post flairs, maybe with categories like ""question"", ""story"", or ""rant"". 

comment any more ideas down below! i think we can make this sub awesome :D",1572824794.0
"The ""Bottomless Pit""",7,dr7bud,EatingIntuitively,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingIntuitively/comments/dr7bud/the_bottomless_pit/,2,"I have been doing IE now since two weeks, and the first week went great. I ate what I wanted to eat, didn't feel guilty a single time and reintroduced foods into my life that were 'forbidden' before. I was so happy, I was never more at peace with food than I was during that first week. And what surprised me the most is that I was able to maintain my weight. I know weight shouldn't be in focus at all, but since I come from a loooong past of dieting, I can't just turn it completely off over night.

And I still am at peace with food, but also having a bit of a concern. Since last Monday, I feel like I could eat all day. I am never really satiated, even though I eat quite a lot of food. I eat whenever I am hungry, I don't try to surpress my hunger or delay eating. But I just keep wanting more. 

And it's just a bit confusing to me because I didn't experience that at all during the first week.

Has anyone else experienced this? Will it eventually pass?",1572817717.0

Currently reading about intuitive eating and it‚Äôs made a huge difference for me this past month. Awareness is everything! I‚Äôm making a chili  (w/out beans because I‚Äôm noticing My body appreciates this way) this weekend for the football game. Eats like this allow for me to have a little...or more, depending on how I feel. It‚Äôs great to have a batch of something that lasts days because it‚Äôs easier for me to stop eating when I feel satiated knowing it‚Äôs in the fridge. I also learned not to feel like I had to match my husbands pace! I was doing this and hadn‚Äôt realized it! I end up eating so much less with these new insights. Who knew?

The 'old' subreddit helped me so much to get into IE, I was never this much at peace with myself as I am now, and that is all to IE and the support of the community.

Already looking forward to seeing this reddit grow :\]

Also my achievement for today: Saw some tasty food in the freezer that I had in there for like 4 months, but I was too scared of the calories in there to eat it. Looking forward to having it as a nice meal on the weekend!",1572641972.0

Usually I guiltily binge on my kids candy after they're in bed. Today I had 3 small pieces and that was all. I didn't even want anymore.

Since I've spent the last few months letting myself eat whatever I want I'm starting to see real changes in my relationship with food. Previous trigger foods don't have the same power over me. I'm still struggling with accepting my body as it is now but overcoming the restriction/binge cycle is miraculous. I never thought I'd get here.",1572627697.0
