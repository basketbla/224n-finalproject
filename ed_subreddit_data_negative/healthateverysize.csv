Unexpected reminder of the science of HAES in a climate science documentary,14,qqwjgh,healthateverysize,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthateverysize/comments/qqwjgh/unexpected_reminder_of_the_science_of_haes_in_a/,1,"Independent filmmaker Neil Halloran's documentary [How Sure are Climate Scientists, Really?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7FAAfK78_M) is about uncertainties in climate science and why they are not excuses for climate change denialism, but the scientific principles it mentioned is applicable in the science of human body weight and health as well. Especially in the following quote:

“There are a lot of good reasons to trust experts. I mean we have to: our society functions thanks to specialised occupations. But when someone questions whether a finding is true, saying trusting the science is a problematic answer. Because we know individual scientists are fallible and individual studies have made false claims; and more importantly that *systemic problems have led to influential groups of scientists to make mistakes*; and we know *the scientific revolution was built on the idea that we don't take people at their word, because we reject authorities of truth. Which is why it's so important for non-experts to on occasion, wade into science*.""

When the narrator read out the sentences in italics, a number of scientific consensuses made by influential groups of scientists that proved to be false appeared on the screen, including homosexuality is a mental disorder, opioids can be used liberally without causing harm to patients, etc. I believe one day, ""ob\*sity is a disease"" will also in the list. 

IMO climate science is actually not the best example of the importance of non-expert participation in science. Medicine is probably a better case, for people know their own bodies better than anyone else. When almost all fat patients point out doctors are wrong, even the ones who do not embrace HAES (yet), doctors must consider the possibility they are wrong.",1636557101.0

The best part: the YMCA I went to had GREAT accommodations to make the facilities accessible for all: the lockers had optional private changing rooms (that were large, with strong bench seating), the showers were also large (with optional shower chairs). Even the manager who gave me a tour was a fat woman. I told her why these accommodations made me feel so welcome, and thanked her for having such a great facility. She told me that I am WELCOME there, and that she was glad I was enjoying it.

Hi. This relates to a friend's mother instead of me, but I've been researching HAES stuff for a year or 2 now and can't seem to find anyone else discussing how to navigate similar issues in places that are easy to find.

Basically:

1. My friend's mother needs a new kidney.
2. Several members of the family have already agreed to test for a match.
3. The only surgeon her doctor has referred her to refuses to do *anything* until she loses a massive amount of weight.
4. She's already on dialysis, and the chance she's ever going to lose weight again, much less in a healthy manner, is nigh impossible.

Is there anything they can do about this without completely demolishing their finances? They *have* insurance, but AFAIK, this was who their insurance approved immediately. I *assume* there are other surgeons they could potentially get their insurance to work with, but I've had absolutely no luck scouring different portals.

It's really depressing, because I'm also a fat disabled person, in a fat disabled family who all need to try and get specialized care, and seeing how hopeless this situation feels makes me terrified of even trying to get help. So many bad experiences overall.

Any advice is most appreciated.",1633785869.0

Not that it matters, but I tend to eat whole grain bread at most meals because sandwiches are cheap lol) Basically, I made a pan of brownies for a group function with my friends. Then when she saw the empty pan the next day, she just ASSUMED that I ate the whole pan because I'm fat. She told me that I am going to die from diabetes and that I need to go to the gym.

All of this was completely unsolicited. She knows nothing about my eating habits. I have been in recovery from an eating disorder for several years, and I follow Intuitive Eating. I listen to what my body wants. I move in ways that bring me pleasure rather than exercising for weight loss.

I am just so sick of people feeling like they can assume things about me and police my eating and exercising just because I am fat. It is so f-ing exhausting, trying to live in a fat body without ridiculous judgement and assumptions.

All this is to say, after receiving that message, I am having such a hard time eating around her at all. I am so anxious to even see her. I have basically locked myself in my room for the last two days and have only eaten one meal in all that time, just because I don't want her to see me eating. Does anyone have any advice for eating around people when you're scared of judgement and assumptions? I have extreme social anxiety and depression anyway so that definitely doesn't help lol.

I thought I’d share some tips for how I found them! I live in the south and there’s absolutely zero HAES-certified doctors in my state, so the registration website for doctors does nothing. 

So, first, I joined local weight-neutral/fat-positive fb groups. I searched those for doctor recommendations, and reached out to those doctors via email. In the “contact us” form, I said the following: 

“I am a practicing patient of “Health at Every Size”. Here’s my medical boundaries (put them here). Will you be comfortable accommodating those needs and supporting my journey? If so, please let me know”

Some doctors didn’t get back to me, but that’s how I found my GP. 

For my nutritionist, I specifically ONLY searched those that support HAES. I found one in the neighboring state and pay out of pocket. I know that’s not accessible to everyone but A LOT of them are sliding scale. Just ask what they can do. 

For my gyno, I called offices with 4+ star reviews. I then called and asked if they had “trauma informed” staff. This will mean they have staff who know how to treat patients with ptsd and other mental health issues. I then asked to speak to one of them. When I got in touch, I asked the nurse if they’d accommodate patients with eating disorders. I then went for an initial annual visit to one that made me feel comfortable. They’ve been fantastic. 

For my psychiatrist, same thing. Asked up front before even seeing her if she had any experience treating eating disorders, then asked from there what they did about weight neutral treatment.

First ever Reddit post - scared of fatphobic doctors (think I may have PCOS),19,miij5f,healthateverysize,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthateverysize/comments/miij5f/first_ever_reddit_post_scared_of_fatphobic/,27,"Hi everyone, I created a Reddit account specifically after finding this HAES space. To provide some context, I have had several experiences over the past 10 years of going to the doctor about something and being palmed off with the suggestion of weight loss with no other guidance, such as back pain and even breathing issues when I had bronchitis a few years ago.

In October 2020 for the first time in my life I fell in love with exercise. I have been seeing a personal trainer 3x a week and have just started learning to run. I am loving it and this is a huge achievement for me because its the first time ever I've been able to enjoy movement without it being as a punishment or as a means to change my appearance. I'm getting so much stronger mentally and physically and I'm thrilled about it. 

I have kept my exercising secret from most people, even family, because I don't want them to bring weight loss discussion into it (which I know they will) as I find it triggering and sets my brain back to my teenage years when I had a very unhealthy body image and would only exercise because I hated myself and not because I loved myself. 

However, I am also experiencing irregular periods. I was on the pill most of my adult life (I'm 30 this year) and since coming off in July 2018 I have had a few months of regular periods here and there, but generally they have never evened out. My cycle varies from 28 days to 40ish days. My periods themselves are normal - not much pain, normal heaviness, 4 days long. 

On top of this, even though it is not my goal, I do find it interesting that I don't appear to have lost any weight as a side effect of my new exercise schedule. Hopefully you can gather how hard it is for me to even think about this, as I am desperate to not bring weight loss into it but do also have to wonder if it's normal that going from no exercise to 3 training sessions and 2 runs a week has not changed how my clothes fit at all (I don't weigh myself, but my body looks the same in terms of fat. My muscles are becoming more noticeable in areas, but I don't believe I'm losing fat and my fiance agrees). 

These things combined lead me to wonder if I may have PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome).

This brings me to my fear. I am so scared to go to the doctor about this because I feel confident they will tell me I need to lose weight. They will suggest a restrictive diet. They will use triggering language and undo the 6 months of hard work I've put in to stop hating my body and to get rid of my disordered relationship with food and exercise.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions for me please? I know no one can diagnose me here, that's not what I'm asking for. I just need people who understand this journey I'm on and my fears to reassure me. I feel like I do need to do best by my body and get it checked out, but I just don't trust doctors anymore. I don't know how to advocate for myself in a doctors appointment, I don't know what to say or how to phrase it. 

Not sure if it's relevant but I'm in the UK.

Groups purely about movement?,26,m939dq,healthateverysize,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthateverysize/comments/m939dq/groups_purely_about_movement/,9,"
Does anyone know of a weight neutral, size neutral, shape neutral space where the emphasis is truly on movement? No nutrition talk, no diet talk, no anti-diet talk, no IE talk, no HAES talk, no „where can I get clothing in size whatever“ talk (these are all relevant concerns covered in other spaces). Somewhere you can talk about going to the gym, dancing, yoga, walking round the block, whatever, without it being about weight loss or weight gain, or changing shape in whatever direction. Somewhere where you can talk about form or struggles with motivation, difficulty moving because of the way your body is built (due to disability, shape, illness, relative lack of or hypermobility etc) without snarking about your size or shape or relative level of fitness no matter what that is (at BOTH ends and the middle of each of those spectrums?). Somewhere where links to movement videos are OK, you can share information about different approaches. Does such a space exist? 

I have been searching the internet for this type of group on and off for a few months now, but either I’m using the wrong words or this type of group is rare or hidden, and I don’t feel I’ve found „my“ space yet. If you know of such a group and have the spoons to point me toward it I would be grateful, thanks. 

PS: This question is not related to anything that has been said or posted in this group and I’m not looking to try and bend this space to my needs. There are different space for different needs, just looking for pointers to other places I can add in addition to this one.",1616231050.0

For context; I’m having a breast reduction in 6 weeks (something I’d been putting off for years bc of BMI related insurance hoops. Finally decided it would make me happier and I’d pay out of pocket). My doctor said it’s best to be at my “natural” weight for the surgery (it helps with sizing and avoids the potential for another procedure later on. My “natural” weight pre covid is about 15lbs lower than where I am, and it’s the idea / ideal in my head. 

I had been feeling confident in not dieting / restricting and I was feeling very “this is my body and this will make me happier in my skin.” I started working out regularly with a class where my trainer / the group are HAES focused, and she had even trained women before surgery before! I want to be strong so healing will be easier. 

Now, the closer I get - the more I think about restricting. And the more I think about restricting, the more I make weird / emotionally based eating decisions.

Despite a life time of wading through the sea of diarrhea that is diet culture while living in a larger body, she turned out to be a pretty amazing woman.

Why is it that anytime a writer means to take on the idea of arduous and difficult transformation, they have to use weight as the central metaphor?

It always sets up the same notion: your body is never good enough. Your body is never right. And fat always means defective.

Why not use a broken family as a metaphor? Why not frame labor intensive, but rewarding transformation through the lens of healing relationships? 

I don't know why this bothers me so much, but it really does. Yes taking up some sort of physical activity has amazing benefits, as does eating a healthful diet and getting enough sleep. And all of those things are difficult to achieve in a culture that prizes hustle while holding down wages and minimizing any social safety net to help people achieve stability. But there are other transformations that are deeper, more profound and frankly more important than achieving and sustaining some sort of magical fucking weight loss.

I know there's probably nothing I can do, and anytime I read a book or listen to a podcast that has to do with self-improvement, ultimately weight loss will come into the equation.

TLDR: really struggling to accept weight gain 

For the past year or so, I have quit dieting. I notice a lot of “food wins” - like noticing when I’m hungry at night, eating something, and not beating myself up over it. 

I’ve been on an antidepressant (Prozac) for about 3 years, and I recently started a stressful grad school program and have been a lot less physically active. 

I’ve gained 40 pounds this year, and before that I had gained around 40 pounds too. I have never been underweight or seen as “thin” - I’ve been fat or chubby all of my life. I’m working on fucking loving my fatness despite society’s insistence that it is ugly and problematic. My body has tons of more stretch marks that I really am trying to accept, but it’s really fucking hard. 

I struggled with bulimia as a teenager and still occasionally do (though I haven’t had a relapse in a long time). 

I feel so uncomfortable with my body. I want to know why my weight keeps going up - is it due to dieting/ED history, antidepressant use, increased stress and decreased activity? Some combination? 

I am really struggling with my body and weight. When will I stop gaining? I used to weigh myself daily and now only do so every couple of months and it’s disheartening to see the scale go up. 

I’m worried about my body, but also ashamed of how she looks. I’m so afraid of getting sucked back into diet culture/ED behaviors. 

I have a great therapist who is HAES-aligned but we mostly discuss other things (ED is not her area of focus).

I’m afraid of exercise because it’s so entangled in diet culture for me. Will that ever go away? I think moving more might make me feel better, but it’s difficult because of that and because of being not used to it. 

Is this... normal? Will it get better? I could really use some reassurance right now.

There has been a lot of talk about ""herd immunity"".  Before this virus came along epidemiologists only considered herd immunity as being possible from a vaccine.  They never considered it from the point of view of allowing the disease to run rampant through a community and killing off those who were susceptible to it in order to gain herd immunity.  That's a recent and ugly development.

&#x200B;

Basically, ""herd immunity"" in the context it is presently being used is saying ""cull the weak"".  For this particular disease, this means anyone who isn't under forty and a perfect specimen of health.  It is basically eugenics and as someone who falls into the category of being susceptible to this disease, I'm not appreciating the attitude I am seeing in those who aren't taking this seriously.  They don't want their freedoms trampled upon, but are perfectly willing to trample upon mine.  There is zero consideration of community responsibility in them.  I could easily go around shaming people for being overly financially leveraged or being too close to the razor's edge with their finances, but I know better than to do that and I know the situation is not cut and dried.  Poverty is real.  People being underemployed is real.  I know not to be so cruel about opening up the economy, because I know there are people desperately at risk.  

&#x200B;

I am currently harboring a lot of anger at people who are perfectly fine with my being invisible or dead and it doesn't matter which, just don't inconvenience them.  Part of it is where I live.  I am surrounded by this thinking and behavior and I'm thinking that when this is over a move may be in order, but some of these people are within my own family and I am just wondering if any of you who have any wisdom to share.

I never had an eating disorder and only really dieted once, about 10 years ago for about 6 months (yes, there is a bit more to unpack there, but let's just leave it at that for now). All along I had thin privilege I did not fully appreciate. 

Other than that period of dieting, my relationship with food was always good, and I naturally ate intuitively. I enjoyed clothing and enjoyed being cute. I was used to being thinner than most of my friends and accepted that as normal. However, I definitely compared myself to and envied women who were thinner or more toned or whatever. I expected to sustain my body for the rest of my life. In some ways, looking back, I can see that I did somehow consider myself superior, which is really yucky to admit.

So that's the background. 

Over the last 10 years, due to menopause and other factors (a particular medication, and possibly a raised set-point due to that diet 10 years ago), I have gained substantial weight. Still ""straight-sized"", but only barely. 

I need to go off that one medication for other reasons, and I secretly hope that will give me back my body. I'm trying not to care one way or the other - but I have to admit that if I lost weight, I would be happy and relieved. That makes me feel like a traitor to HAES. 

As a result of HAES, I have managed to sustain body neutrality for the most part (I don't actually hate my body. I'm ok with it. I just wish it was different). I'm not pursuing intentional weight loss and I still eat intuitively. But there are some things that are still hard. 

- I worry that friends and family wonder if I had an eating disorder all along. 
- I worry friends or family have feelings of schadenfreude now that I'm not the thin one anymore. 
- Clothes aren't fun anymore.
- I feel like I am somehow failing in my societal obligation to be attractive.
- I'm sometimes not sure if I really have anything to offer if I'm not cute.
- I don't really recognize myself in the mirror or in photos, and I don't feel like ""me.""
- I feel guilty for complaining because I still have thin privilege as a straight-sized person. 

So I think that's all for now. I haven't been able to share these feelings with anyone else, and so I appreciate the opportunity here. Thank you.

I hope this is the right sub for this question, I would appreciate some guidance if it isnt. 
Over the past year or so I've made some significant progress in reclaiming my relationship with food. It's far from perfect, but I (mostly) don't feel guilty over the things I eat anymore, which has made a huge difference in my ability to eat the amounts of food that my body asks for, and not more. However, after this year or so of allowing myself to eat the foods that make me happy, it's become quite apparent that my body doesn't do well on certain foods (grains in particular). I used to follow the Paleo ""lifestyle"" and that is when I felt my physical best....but also mentally my worst. I have a complicated relationship with food and limiting myself only makes me glorify the foods being eliminated, and I eventually crumble under stress and then feel like shit about myself. I would really love to find a way to not eat foods that make me feel like garbage, but also turn off the mental part of me that will automatically turn this into a diet with the possibility of failure.

This post is hard to write because I'm not sure how to describe my situation without sounding weird. I guess though, that's why I'm compelled to write it here because I haven't been able to explain it to anyone in my life. 

Basically, I'm 23 and live a pretty happy and successful life overall. I've always been ""bigger"" but I've always landed in that place between straight size and plus size (between a 12-16). When I was younger I wasn't made fun of for my weight or made unpopular in any way but I didn't love the body I had until I was in my late teens/early 20s. So overall I'm pretty confident and comfortable with myself the issue is that I don't feel healthy anymore. 

I moved out 5 years ago and the stress of school and work and being a real adult really overwhelmed me. At the beginning I was still pretty active and motivated to cook and eat in a way that made me happy and healthy but something changed and I can't figure it out. I just started eating however I wanted and not really moving my body at all. I have literally gained like 60lbs in 5 years and I feel so lost in making it stop. 

So now I'm worried that I've lost all control of my life.  I try to find positive ways to be healthier but every time I try to look at tips about being healthy I just end up being sucked into the black abyss of diet culture that makes me want to vomit because I can literally feel it implanting horrendous thoughts about myself and the short cuts I could take in my head. All of which is to say that that is a resounding HELL NO from me sis! 

Anyway, that's me pouring my spiralling psyche onto the internet in the hope that someone here can relate and share a little insight into how they are managing being a stressed out baby adult who can't believe how hard it is to feed yourself properly.",1581997539.0

HAES public figure's media was in many ways a symptom of her anorexia. Help me navigate my feelings?,8,bwu7s9,healthateverysize,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthateverysize/comments/bwu7s9/haes_public_figures_media_was_in_many_ways_a/,1,"So this is going to be immensely unpopular but I don’t know where else to go with it.  Using a throwaway because I know there will be mad backlash.  I am a HAES RD and I’ve recently been following the experiences of a high-profile psychotherapist, a thought leader and HAES/Body Trust advocate in our community.  Because she has put herself out there in marketing and advocacy efforts as a public figure and has encouraged us to follow along when her situation was hidden and as it unfolded, I feel like it’s appropriate to unpack it a bit.  If this were a private person or a non-public figure, I would not.

I’m talking about Shira, the owner of the popular blog “A sequin love affair.”  In summary, Shira has been suffering (in isolation) for decades with restriction and purging based experiences of disordered eating—an eating disorder she now has identified as anorexia (while living in a larger body, which is considered “atypical” to our collective dismay).  She also is an eating disorder therapist and treats other people’s eating disorders and diet mentality clinically and has been doing so for about a decade.

Let me back up for a sec.  A lot of Shira’s public media is about aesthetic beauty and showcases her in images, passionately taking a stand against intentional weight loss, weight-obsession and dieting (opinion: this is awesome!).  She also has a lot of pictures looking radiant while holding or posing with donuts, ice cream, pizza and other foods.  Not eating it, just posing with it, looking adoringly at it or the camera.  At the time, it struck me as intense.  I immediately thought, “this is how people with restrictive eating disorders often interact with food.  Does she have anorexia?”

Personally, I get where a lot of us enjoy posting vibrant pictures of play foods in order to take the stigma out.  I’m not a fan because it can perpetuate or hide eating disorders, and because eating in a self-kind and non-disordered way isn’t about fetishizing once-taboo foods, it’s about taking all foods back to the “table.”

A few months back, she publicly announced that she was going for treatment and was congratulated for her bravery and applauded for all her work.  And no one said anything about the big issue around integrity here (which, empathetically, was owing to the disorder but is still an issue).  It was just celebration and support.  No one said anything about how, maybe, all of the marketing on the blog—about image and play foods and the like—were symptoms of the disorder.

Now this week, a GoFundMe came out that she wants people to donate $75,000 so she can go to treatment because the treatment center she went to dismissed her after treating her with a slew of fat-phobic and invalidating attitudes, mocking that she was a therapist, and trying to say she was “manipulative” when she was advocating for herself.  She won’t say what the treatment center was but some have said they can infer based on it being the only one with a “three strikes” rule.

I totally believe her experience.  It’s so common for not just fat people, but for anyone who doesn’t meet the (highly inappropriate) BMI cut off for anorexia.  I feel for her so much, and I do hope she get the help she needs.  She’s a good person and puts her heart and her confidence into so much for this community.

I’m just sitting with so much shock that no one has said anything but glowing things about her media, marketing and advocacy efforts…especially since so much of them seem to have been written by her ED voice, or at least infused with ED’s obsessions.

I understand that she’s suffering right now.  But she also chose to be a public figure, and some of her media has been harmful, and I think we can hold space to both hold her accountable and offer her compassion/empathy and donations.  I plan to donate.  I just wish we weren’t sweeping the issues under the rug.

Sorry to vent.  I know I can’t be the only one who has been experiencing these unfolding events of one of our public figures this way.  Is anyone else sitting with a mix of thoughts and feelings like this?

HAES/IE therapists in LA?,2,azz1bw,healthateverysize,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthateverysize/comments/azz1bw/haesie_therapists_in_la/,1,"Hi all! I also posted this in the intuitive eating sub. I'm moving to LA and had great therapists where I last lived. I want to continue therapy because despite going for about a year and a half, I feel like I barely scratched the surface of all my issues. The thing is, neither of the therapists I had knew about IE or HAES or really about the damage diet culture can do. Towards the end of my last session, I started to talk about everything I was learning from my own research and my therapist asked me to send him the resources because he was shocked he'd never heard of the movement. He said he had a lot of clients that could benefit from IE and HAES. Both therapists were amazing for a lot of things, but that is just something that I don't think was a huge part of their training. So while I appreciate him being honest, I'd like to see someone who can teach me instead of me teaching my therapist. Any ideas? I have a great insurance plan with Blue Shield if that helps.

From the full paper:

>Perhaps the most revealing result of this study is that, despite
a relatively higher level of motivation among women being
active to lose weight (ie, globally higher motivation scores)
,
the
presence of controlled eating motivation, especially introjected
regulation, was associated with poorer eating outcomes (ie, less
intuitive eating). This is consistent with SDT *(self determination theory)*,
which emphasizes the importance of motivation quality (ie, autonomous vs
controlled motivation) and proposes that the presence of a
higher level of motivation will not necessarily harvest beneficial
outcomes, especially if the motivation is of poor quality (ie,
controlled). 

Also:

>this study adds to the extant literature by con-
fi
rming that eating motivations partially mediate the associ-
ations between weight-focused physical activity goals (vs
non-weight goals) and intuitive eating. Women who were
active to lose or control their weight reported higher levels of
introjected eating regulation, which in turn was associated
with lower reliance on hunger and satiety cues, more
emotional rather than physically driven eating, and lower
unconditional permission to eat whatever food is desired. On
the other hand, the partial mediation suggests that there may
also be other, more relevant, mediating paths explaining the
links between physical activity goals and intuitive eating.
Body image might constitute such a path, according to previous studies.
For example, it is plausible that women
who are active for health goals, as opposed to appearance
goals, may be more attuned to their inner experiences and to
improvements in their overall
fi
tness condition, which may
in turn be associated with greater appreciation for and
connection to their bodies and, subsequently, increase the
capacity of listening to body signals in order to establish
when, what, and how much to eat.

The authors recognize that the while the study had a diverse ethnic and socio-economic representation in the ~1700 response participants, it is still limited by geography and should be repeated in other areas of the world.  This study also looked at exercising for weight loss vs. not for weight loss, and did not look at the many reasons why people might choose to exercise and its effects on food intake.",1548084947.0

So... I am totally new here. Previously, only a casual stalker of very famous and/or very strange AMAs. 

BUT I am currently working on a research project focused on the impact of body positive media on self-identified plus sized women and want to reach as wide an audience as possible - so to Reddit I go!

I am a 28-year old graduate student at NYU; I have served as a writer, performer, educator and activist and have been plus-sized my whole life - leading to a deep understanding of many of the issues facing bigger women and a passion for the potential the body positive movement can make on mainstream culture. I am seeking female-identifying individuals who wear a minimum US size 16/18 or 2X/3X to take a 15 minute survey on their history, body image, and engagement with the BoPo movement - and if you're really into it, I'm also hoping to facilitate a focus group for those who want to reflect on their own engagement with body positive media over a 4-6 week period from mid-October to November. 

Surveys are completely anonymous unless you choose to provide your name/pseudonym/email; but the more participants I get, the more light I will be able to shed on the factors contributing to positive body image in plus-sized women and USE IT TO MAKE EVERYONE TO GET ON BOARD!

I hope this community will consider taking a few moments out of their day to connect with this study, both for their own engagement and to help out a fellow curvy bopo/HAES power bitch. [https://goo.gl/forms/p9LedgRwUTV0qlz82](https://goo.gl/forms/p9LedgRwUTV0qlz82)

A recently published study is being touted as saying that *""metabolically healthy obese women will eventually become metabolically unhealthy and are at higher risk for heart disease.""*

Unsurprisingly, [that's not completely what it says](http://www.drsharma.ca/the-vast-majority-of-healthy-people-will-become-unhealthy).  As usual, the parts that cover non-obese people are being left behind.

The study followed 90 thousand women over 30 years.


It did find that **metabolically healthy obese people are 80% likely to become metabolically unhealthy**. 

They also found that **metabolically healthy 'normal weight' women are 70% likely to become metabolically unhealthy**. 

Metabolically unhealthy women, no matter what their weight, are drastically more likely to have an increased risk of developing heart disease.  

Metabolically healthy women with obesity only have a 40% increased risk of heart disease, compared to the increased risk for metabolically unhealthy normal weight women (243%), overweight women (260%), and obese women (315%).

You can fight against this increased risk.  Work to become a healthier person, whether you are or are not metabolically healthy.

Follow HAES. Pay attention to what you eat. Learn to stop demonizing foods so you make more mindful choices.  And, if you're not already, get going and exercise.  Exercise is THE best key to long-term health.

I said something to that effect and she just kept it up with the BMI and how many calories I should be eating based on my height and on and on...I finally got so frustrated that I cut her off with ""look, I guess what I'm saying is that I don't believe in dieting anymore...""

[Researchers find removing an enzyme prevents mice from becoming obese no matter what they eat](http://healthsciences.ku.dk/news/2018/05/researchers-defy-biology-mice-remain-slim-on-burger-diet/).  Two groups of mice were fed identical, high fat diets. The control mice all gained weight. The mice with the enzyme deleted did not.

There are likely  major implications from deleting the enzyme in humans, but it's still a valuable insight.

[Obese mice have less taste buds](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/03/new-obesity-solutions-may-be-tip-your-tongue). Again, two sets of mice were fed high fat diets. One group of obesity-resistant mice gained less weight and lost fewer taste buds than the other group of mice. This might mean that loss of taste encourages eating more food.

[A prebiotic seems to abate inflammation and osteo-arthritis in obese mice.](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/95997) In mice, gut bacteria is tightly tied to inflammation which in turn promotes osteo-arthritis.  This prebiotic seems to change the gut bacteria, which improves inflammation which in turn reduces or prevents joint degradation. While the mice are still obese, joint health is noticeably healthier than in those without the bacteria change.

**Read into this with caution.** This is a single study, although large scale and longitudinal.  No cause & effect have been found; although there are hypotheses offered they are just that -- guesses as to what's going on. They  do note that previous studies that found that all sugar consumption raise mortality risk, this is the first to look separately at food and drink.

While the increased risk of mortality itself is higher for those who are overweight or obese, there is no additional risk for CVD by weight.

It's important to remember that ""increased risk"" means the amount of risk itself is not raised, but raised by the risk percentage. 

If you previously have a 10% risk of mortality, and your risk is ""increased by 30%,"" your risk of mortality is now (10+[10*.30] or 13%, not 40%.

If you have a 30% risk and it's increased by 30%, your new risk is 39%, not 60%.

I bought compression leggings for my workouts, but they only really ""compress"" around the waist, they don't help to support the pannus.

I knew my ""dieting"" was a little extreme, but I also thought everyone did it and that i was somehow just not trying hard enough. The first book I read that introduced me to HAES was Lessons From The FatOSphere by Kate Harding and Marianne Kirby. What I read made me angry- really angry! They were taking away my fantasy of being thin but also challenging all of my scientific understanding of weight (and I pride myself on being science based!). When all of the information finally sunk in, however, I not only became an activist, but I realized I had an eating disorder. That book gave me the courage to talk to my psychologist.. but not only that, it gave me the ability go immediately go into recovery without further struggle. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean that I don't still have ED thoughts, but I haven't relapsed once single time since following HAES and intuitive eating. ",1341166681.0

My HAES story,8,vtr8w,healthateverysize,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthateverysize/comments/vtr8w/my_haes_story/,5,"I've always been shorter and wider than my peers, even when I was a toddler. As a teenager, I learned to hate this fact, and started the whole dieting nightmare. I was never physically active except for occasional bursts of exercise in an attempt to lose weight (my situation is somewhat complicated by the fact that I have [aquagenic pruritus](http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aquagenicskin/), which means that getting wet or sweating makes me itch like my whole body is on fire -- more on that later).

In November of 2004 I discovered the Fat Acceptance movement, and gave up dieting forever. Once I gave myself permission to eat as much of absolutely anything I wanted, whenever I wanted, I started to eat a much more balanced diet. Please do not hear me saying that I now eat an ideal diet. I just no longer gorge on ""forbidden"" foods with an occasional broccoli binge thrown in out of guilt. Now I eat a wide variety of GOOD food and don't feel guilty about any of it. 

As I got older, the lack of exercise started having ""undesirable effects"" -- getting out of breath going up stairs, feeling sore getting out of bed in the morning, just generally not being able to move around as easily -- so I started trying to do more physical activity. Walking became my main form of exercise, but I still had problems because of my AP -- I was undiagnosed at that point; all I knew was that sweating made me itch -- so I tried SWIMMING, LOL. I finally just decided that I was cursed and gave up. 

Then, in March of 2010, I herniated a disc in my lower back. The pain was unbelievable. I was hustled off to physical therapy and for the first time experienced exercise as pain relief rather than a chore. My therapist was focused on getting and keeping me functional and not on trying to turn me into a triathlete. It was pretty damned revelatory. Around the same time I got my AP diagnosed and started finding ways to minimize the itching, to where I can now do my routine every day, sweat, and not feel like I want to throw myself immediately into a vat of itching powder.

I've kept up the moderate daily exercise regimen that my physical therapist prescribed for me, because I never want to be in that much pain again. I still can't say that I love exercise, but it feels physically good to do it, the same way that feeding myself well feels.

Through this whole process, I have remained the same size (""fat""), but my indicators (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) are all now within the ""normal"" range. Today I feel healthier and stronger than I ever have, and plan to live to at least 100.",1341023420.0
