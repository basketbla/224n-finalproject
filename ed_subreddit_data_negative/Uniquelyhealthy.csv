Welcome!,4,fp1uel,Uniquelyhealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uniquelyhealthy/comments/fp1uel/welcome/,0,"Welcome to Uniquely Healthy :)

Find your unique way of being healthy through self-care and healthy habits.

Here we talk about:
Intuitive eating and non-diet eating, joyful movement, mindfulness, taking care of ourselves without a focus on our appearance, and self-care of all kinds through a weight inclusive and non-diet lens.

This club is HAES® and anti-diet aligned and encourages conversations on self-care through an intersectional lens (chronic illness, disability, mental health, anti-racism, LGBTQIA2S+, body positivity, accessibility and more).

And just a reminder that health and the way we take care of ourselves looks different for everyone - and is not a moral obligation.

Please read the rules and make sure to add content warnings whenever necessary. We also do not tolerate any disrespect here. Trolls will be banned. If you have any concerns, you can send the mods a message.

We're so happy to have you here!

Happy Habits starts tomorrow!!,2,run33o,Uniquelyhealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uniquelyhealthy/comments/run33o/happy_habits_starts_tomorrow/,2,"Hi! I’m the creator of this sub I created Happy Habits for the members of r/uniquelyhealthy. It's a 12-week program that was designed to help you implement healthy habits and self-care in your life in a realistic and flexible way free of diet culture!

This program is great for those who:
1. Have a hard time adding self-care to their life and keeping it consistent

2. Have stopped dieting and focusing on weight loss and don't know how to take care of themselves without diet culture

3. Lack compassion and flexibility when it comes to their healthy habits aka beating themselves up when things don't go as planned

Looking for guidance on exercise,5,phg7kb,Uniquelyhealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uniquelyhealthy/comments/phg7kb/looking_for_guidance_on_exercise/,2,"Hello! This looks like the perfect community for me. I’m trying to improve my fitness and maybe find some physical activity I might enjoy.

I’m a fat, autistic, diabetic trans man with chronic fatigue and I recently started testosterone. Most of my physical activity at the moment is physiotherapy exercises for a bad leg (ileo-tibial band syndrome) and weak ankles. I need to increase my levels of physical activity slowly because I’m at risk of post-exertional malaise (where I temporarily or permanently lose capacity from overexerting myself). But testosterone has given me a little more energy, which is nice.

I’m currently working up my physio slowly to what I’m actually supposed to do, after which I plan to add in exercises for strength (especially core and upper body) and flexibility.

I’m also interested in maybe doing stuff with people. I’ve enjoyed dance and martial arts in the past, but I’m wary of exhausting myself by trying to get through a two-hour class. Team sports terrify me, so maybe not that. I’m fully vaccinated but I’m still vulnerable and live with other vulnerable (though vaccinated) adults. I’d probably prefer outdoor to indoor activities just now.

Any thoughts or tips you might have would be appreciated!",1630711233.0

Toxic fitness class,25,oh4bue,Uniquelyhealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uniquelyhealthy/comments/oh4bue/toxic_fitness_class/,4,"I attended a spin class today and the instructor was saying some toxic fitness stuff like:

You have to earn your weekend,

If you’re not going to work hard you can leave now.

We dont want any wimps in class

He asked me once during the class what my tension was and I was at 16 and he told the class that you had to be between 17-20 no exceptions. So I lied and said 17.

Then we have a drill and he says he wants everyone to do 100rpm and if you don’t he’ll call you out because he can tell how fast you’re going based on the speed of your feet. I was doing 80 because I had a flare up yesterday (I have Crohn’s) and didnt want to push myself. I dont have to justify myself but anyways he calls me out and I end up having to scream that I had a flare up yesterday during the conversation making ‘fun’ of me for not going 100

And then he said more stuff like you’re here for a reason. If you dont want to work hard you should of just stayed home on your couch

Anyways, I will not be going to his class again lol

As a a trainer and instructor, I want to point out that not all classes and instructors are like that. There are positive, inclusive ones out there! This one just wasn’t it.",1625863641.0

My colleagues Brenna, Hailey, and I recorded 5 workshops that address various topics surrounding fatphobia like:

\- The history of diet culture & modern diet culture

\- The history of the Body Positivity and the Fat acceptance movements

\- The history of the ""ob\*sity epidemic"" and the BMI

\- The health consequences of fatphobia

\- How to become more inclusive

You can find the videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7O8-ng92M13qkEC1xkGLyhNlKlIArhot).

I'm sharing these here because they could be a great resource to send others if you don't feel like explaining why fatphobia is bad or why the ""ob\*sity epidemic"" is not really an epidemic. It's a good way to make us do the work instead of spending your precious energy explaining to someone why you can be fat and healthy.

But, anytime I would start a fitness program, I would often see advice in the beginning which went something like: ""If you're new to exercise then you should start slow. Studies show that taking on too much too early is why so and so much people quit"".   


For some reason, I never took that advice! And I would always end up quitting because it was too stressful. But for the past 4 weeks, I've actually been way more consistent than I ever have by doing a 5-10 minute warmup. I actually look forward to it and even think about what other physical activities I might want to add on later when I feel like it.

My jeans are a bit snug right now and that’s OK!,1,fvzszd,Uniquelyhealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uniquelyhealthy/comments/fvzszd/my_jeans_are_a_bit_snug_right_now_and_thats_ok/,0,"Have you ever put on a pair of jeans or your pair of shorts from last summer and realized that they were a bit snug or didn’t fit?

Since I was a teenager, I’ve had to buy some new shorts every summer.

At the beginning of summer, I would always try on my shorts from last year to see if they fit. When they didn’t, the feelings that accompanied that were usually feelings of guilt, failure, panic, despair and then many many thoughts about what I was going to do to lose weight. Those thoughts were there constantly, non-stop. They consumed almost all of my brain power.

Sometimes, it would feel like a success because I had worked so hard to grow the booty and needing new shorts must of meant I was successful. But still, I was never satisfied and negative thoughts always came.

I’m telling you all this because I ran out of clean pyjama and sweat pants today (lol) and had to put on jeans to bring my dog out for a walk. My jeans are a bit snug right now.

But that doesn’t mean I need to lose weight. It means that when they don’t feel comfortable for me anymore, I can go get some new jeans. (I know I have the privilege to be able to do that most of the time and that it’s not a possibility for everyone).

You don’t need to change your body to fit the clothes, you need to change the clothes to fit YOU.

I know that’s the opposite of what the memes are saying right now but I wanted to remind you that it’s OK to gain weight right now and always.

You are worthy and amazing right now, in the body you have!

I know a lot of us are struggling with body image right now. I’m sending so much love your way ❤️",1586183714.0
