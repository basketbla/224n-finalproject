Resources/suggestions for the sub!,2,ci3dpf,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/ci3dpf/resourcessuggestions_for_the_sub/,7,"Hi everyone!

As I'm getting things set up fully over here, I thought I'd reach out for things you want to see included officially on the sub.

&#x200B;

If you have any resources for fat acceptance/positivity that you love or think would be valuable to someone visiting for the first time, **please share them in the comments** to potentially be included on our sub's official documentation!

This includes:

\- Fat activists/accounts/creators you follow on any platform

\- Articles or reading you've found helpful, informative, etc.

\- Videos of any kind related to fat liberation

\- Anything that's added to the fat acceptance movement for you personally!

&#x200B;

In addition, please **share any rules or guidelines** you think are important for people to keep in mind when navigating a fat-positive space. Anything that will foster a safer community. I will be working on material about intersectionality and privilege.

&#x200B;

Any other suggestions or ideas can be commented here or sent to mod mail!",1564150438.0

Hi I created an anti dieting subreddit,16,cjgpa6,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/cjgpa6/hi_i_created_an_anti_dieting_subreddit/,2,"It's called r/antidiet. I thought you guys may be interested in such a subreddit. I created it a few months ago. 

I hope this is allowed on here.",1564431155.0
Award-winning scientist Jeffrey M. Friedman proves obesity is NOT lack of Will power - it’s genetic; but says the comment section remains unconvinced and prefers to blame fat people,12,cj4mjb,fatliberation,https://youtu.be/lkvle0f4-Qw,2,,1564364685.0
doing things for the love of it <3,8,cj3ssr,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/cj3ssr/doing_things_for_the_love_of_it_3/,8,"hi! i'm a small-fat/inbetween lady in my late 20s... sizewise, i struggle at the top of the line at straight-size places, but am usually on the smallest end of plus sizes. 

i have been working for the past few years on carving out a comfy neutral stance with my body, all the foods it wants to eat, and the activities i love to do—especially dance and figure skating. both of which are overwhelmingly populated by (very) thin people, but i will say there's something damned satisfying about being the fattest girl in the studio, and giving it hell anyway... and nothing makes my body feel better than losing myself in movement!

the health at every size movement has been really meaningful to me with regard to severing those super fraught ties between Doing Active Things and the expectation of ""results""... which frees us up to do stuff because it feels good, as its own reward.

if you feel similarly about anything, what does your body love to do? how did you discover it? or have you had to untangle anything from the ""results"" mindset?",1564360129.0
Books about Fat Liberation?,13,cj1jbg,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/cj1jbg/books_about_fat_liberation/,12,"Hey y’all, I have been fat my whole life and have been shamed for it my whole life. Have survived eating disorders and years of abusing my body and right now I’m finally researching more and more about fat liberation and loving myself AS I AM. It’s hard for a multitude of reasons, one being, I love working out but hate that it becomes obsessive (trying to get over that so I can feel physically strong again) and two being that I have no fat friends. I LOVE this page and would love to connect with all of you in a meaningful and beautiful way and I think books are a great way to do that. Maybe we can start with suggestions or even start a book club kinda thing? IDK! I’ll post what i’m currently reading in the comments.",1564348480.0
Anyone heard of Fat-Topia? Cause I just watched the trailer and it looks like it should be called “Fatphobia Disguises Itself As Public Health Crisis”,10,ci8t06,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/ci8t06/anyone_heard_of_fattopia_cause_i_just_watched_the/,4,"So this dude on Instagram told me to check out his documentary called “Fat-Topia” because “I might be interested.” I’m guessing he assumes this because I’m fat? So I go check it out, wondering whether this guy is a troll or not. 

The trailer makes it look like an absolute dumpster fire of fatphobia. Toooons of footage with fat peoples faces blurred out, all voiced over with dire-sounding reporters voicing concern over the obesity epidemic, and some guy saying people are eating themselves to death, etc. It’s pretty cringe. 

Has anyone else seen this shit? Am I missing something?",1564176642.0
"Sick of fighting it. With all the wasted mental energy of my numerous yo-yo weight loss attempts, I could have done something useful with my life. Sick of hearing the supposedly-easy ""eat less, move more"", when all the science shows only a tiny minority can stick to that. Sick of everything.",23,ci3r68,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/ci3r68/sick_of_fighting_it_with_all_the_wasted_mental/,8,"I'm not prone to ""positivity"", sorry. 

I think this endless battle against the scale turned me more and more cynical over the years. Not sure if I'm in the right place. I don't want to be positive and hate it when people tell me to smile more. I want someplace to be angry and vocal about society's mistreatment of a huge group of people, who have done nothing wrong to anyone.",1564152365.0
Hello all!,13,chwat5,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/chwat5/hello_all/,0,"Wow, I definitely wasn’t expecting to see 50+ people join in the first few hours of creating this sub. Hopefully most of you aren’t trolls!

In the coming days, I’ll be fully fleshing out the sub with a full rule book, automod, aesthetic bits, fat acceptance resources, proper stickied posts, etc. 

Until then feel free to post and introduce yourselves and everything! I’ll do my best to remove any and all trolls or nasties before I get the automod set up!",1564103474.0
Introduction thread?,9,chx9qs,fatliberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatliberation/comments/chx9qs/introduction_thread/,12,"I’m pretty psyched about this subreddit existing and I’m looking forward to growing with this community. That said, maybe we could share some stuff about ourselves?

Me, I’ve always been fat, ever since I was a kid. That got worse when I started dieting with my mom when I was 9. I learned how to binge eat from her and it turned into an eating disorder. I’ve been dieting for over 20 years and, well, I’m still fat. I’m tired of the shame and feeling like I will only matter “when I get skinny.” That led me to Brene Brown’s work on shame, and intuitive eating, and I haven’t looked back. I want to feel good and be as healthy as I can, but my days of trying fad diets are over. I am trying, and sometimes succeeding, in loving my body for how it is today and not how it might be one day. So that’s me.",1564109215.0
