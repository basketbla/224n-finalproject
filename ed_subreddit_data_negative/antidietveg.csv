Antidietveg Resources and Terms,5,lko5e4,antidietveg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidietveg/comments/lko5e4/antidietveg_resources_and_terms/,0,"**What is diet culture/antidiet?**

[Diet culture](https://christyharrison.com/blog/what-is-diet-culture) is a system of beliefs that equates thinness to health and moral virtue. It promotes restricting certain foods and food groups and often promotes weight loss above all else. It shames people who do not match up with its narrow view of health. 

Being antidiet means opposing diet culture and its tools of oppression, including fatphobia, anti-fat bias, and weight stigma. It means encouraging peaceful relationships with food and removing the barriers to basic human rights and compassion for people of all body types. 

**What is veganism?**

The Vegan Society defines veganism as:

>… *a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals*.

**How is veganism compatible with antidiet principles?** 

Veganism is not a diet. As stated above, it is a philosophy. It extends beyond food choices to affect products you will or won't buy (leather, fur, etc.), places you will or won't patronize (zoos, aquariums, etc.), and other choices you make in your life to reduce animal suffering and exploitation. 

As long as the choice to be vegan/vegetarian does not stem from a place of disordered eating or restriction, it can be compatible with antidiet principles. Unfortunately, this distinction can be hard to make and some people in eating disorder recovery find it necessary to consume animal food products on their journey to recovery. That is one of the reasons this group is open to not only vegans, but also vegetarians and those who are veg curious. 

It is important to keep in mind that even in cases like this where consuming animal food products may be necessary to your health, you can still live out the morals of a vegan philosophy in other parts of your life by engaging in activism, boycotting nonfood animal products, etc. 

**What is intuitive eating?**

[Intuitive eating](https://www.intuitiveeating.org/what-is-intuitive-eating-tribole/), developed by registered dietitians Elyse Resch and Evelyn Tribole, is an evidence-based way to create a peaceful relationship with food. It emphasizes focusing on internal rather than external cues to figure out how best to nourish yourself. It is not a diet. In fact, a core tenant of intuitive eating is removing food restrictions. 

**What is Health At Every Size?**

[Health At Every Size (HAES)](https://asdah.org/health-at-every-size-haes-approach/) is the idea that people can be healthy in many differently sized bodies. This does not mean that any one size is automatically healthy or unhealthy. Rather than putting focus on body size and weight, HAES suggests looking at the markers of health and also argues that physical health is not the only thing to consider. It also promotes the belief that all people should have access to information and services that improve overall well-being.

Eating vegan/living a vegan lifestyle vs eating a vegan diet,4,mz25jx,antidietveg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidietveg/comments/mz25jx/eating_veganliving_a_vegan_lifestyle_vs_eating_a/,0,"I was just listening to Christy Harrison's Food Psych. In reference to being gluten free for Celiac's, she said she refers to it as eating gluten free vs being on a gluten free diet. She does this because if you have Celiac's, it can actually be intuitive eating to not eat gluten; therefore, being gluten free in this context is not a diet since IE is incompatible with diets (i.e. reject the diet mentality). 

This made me think about the way I talk about being vegan. For me, it is very important to avoid referring to veganism as a diet because while we sometimes use diet to just mean the way we eat, it has mostly become synonymous with eating restrictively. 

I like the idea of saying, ""I eat in a way that is in alignment with a vegan lifestyle, I eat vegan,"" or simply, ""I am vegan"" and purposefully avoiding phrasing like ""I follow a vegan diet."" Avoiding referring to veganism as a diet also speaks to the fact that veganism is about more than just the way a person eats.",1619455875.0

Veganizing traditional dishes,2,lmrkzq,antidietveg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidietveg/comments/lmrkzq/veganizing_traditional_dishes/,0,"One of the more insidious parts of diet culture is isolating people from their families and traditions. For example, by demonizing rice, particularly white rice, when it's a staple of a lot of Asian dishes. At times, veganism can venture into this since that meat is an important part of a lot of cultures, so I was happy to find these two websites, which focus on veganizing traditional dishes. They do contain some nutritional facts and ""health"" information, but I think they can be a valuable source overall. Have you come across any other helpful resources? I've been trying to veganize some of my grandmother's Slovak recipes, so I'm excited to dig into these.
