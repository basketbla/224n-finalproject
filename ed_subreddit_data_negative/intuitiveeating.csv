Please make sure to give this a thorough read prior to engaging on the sub and read the sub rules!",82,n01iuc,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/n01iuc/updated_mustread_welcome_to_rintuitiveeating/,14,"**PLEASE CONSULT THE ABOUT PAGE FOR THE UPDATED SUB RULES.**

&#x200B;

***Important Updates:***

* A new rule regarding weight-neutral language has been added, as well as no longer allowing use of the word ""obese"" unless under certain circumstances (check the rules for clarification).
* We will not tolerate fatphobia, but it is imperative to understand that we cannot disallow people from discussing fears surrounding weight gain. Keep in mind that this fear is often accompanied by eating disorders and body dysmorphia and we are here to help people embrace IE and *unlearn* their fatphobia, so ignoring the topic, albeit triggering, can and will do more harm than good. If you are not able to participate in such a discussion without being triggered, please avoid such discussions and know that we are working to make sure any discussions about this will be adequately flaired as triggering and actively moderated before being locked to prevent trolling. *Any discussions surrounding a fear of weight gain* ***absolutely must be accompanied by a trigger warning flair AND a spoiler tag. Failure to do this may result in deletion of your post, a warning for a future ban, or a temporary/permanent ban if you've previously been warned.***
* Any posts that are deemed high-risk to bring on trolls will be locked once moderators believe that the OP has received adequate responses. This is for your protection.
* We are working on detailed posts about fatphobia (1) and the Body Positive Social Justice Movement (2), which will both be linked below once they are complete. If you'd like to help with those, feel free to reach out!
* We have been in contact with FatLogic moderators and as a result they will no longer allow any reddit content to be posted on the sub due to brigading and trolling. *This is a huge win for the reddit anti-diet community!* This means that we should see far less brigading/trolling, but if you have any issues with FatLogic posters harassing you or commenting on our threads, reach out to the mod team immediately and report the post/comment so we can assess the situation and take proper action.
* Controversial questions about IE may be asked on our Saturday General Questions thread. Asking controversial questions on other threads may result in a ban and arguing with people about IE in comment threads WILL RESULT IN A BAN.

[Here is a thread about HAES.](https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/mwa4q8/could_someone_explain_haes_to_me/)

&#x200B;

r/intuitiveeating is an anti-diet, body-positive, inclusive space. Intuitive Eating is a way of life that includes returning to our natural way of eating where we don't allow diet culture and external factors to rule our lives. The concept was put into words by Elyse Resch and Evelyne Tribole, two registered dieticians, in the 1990s. Over the years, ER and ET have updated their book, Intuitive Eating, to shift along with the world and current societal issues that are common-place.

&#x200B;

In order to have the best grasp of the concepts of IE, it is best to ensure that you are up to date with at least the third edition, Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program That Works, or the most recent/fourth edition, Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Anti-Diet Approach. Older versions are no longer up to date and contain some semi-problematic information regarding weight-loss. ER and ET also have an accompanying workbook, The Intuitive Eating Workbook, which is a fantastic resource for new and seasoned intuitive eaters alike! It is especially great if you are unable to seek help from an eating disorder specialized mental health practitioner or HAES certified/anti-diet registered dietician, although it is great even if you see a professional too. ET has a workbook specifically made for teens, The Intuitive Eating Workbook for Teens.

&#x200B;

Other extremely popular books on the topic include Just Eat It by Laura Thomas (u/elianna7 's personal favourite) and her accompanying workbook, How To Just Eat It, Anti-Diet by Christy Harrison, The F\\\*ck It Diet by Caroline Dooner, and Health at Every Size by Lindo Bacon (published under the name Linda Bacon).

&#x200B;

Please make sure that before you post or comment, you read our sub rules. Many of the rules are standard practice, but some require a bit more attention.

&#x200B;

* We do not allow discussion of diet-tips or diets, including but not limited to: calorie counting (CICO), If It Fits Your Macros/IIFYM, Keto, Paleo, Intermittent Fasting, Fasting, Detoxes, Juice Cleanses, Low-Carb, High-Carb/Low-Fat, Atkins, Weight Watchers, Noom, Optavia, Herbalife, Isagenix, Beach Body, Salt/Oil/Sugar-Free or SOS-Free, Clean Eating, etc. We do not allow the discussion of  intentional weight-loss, as that is not conducive to intuitive eating. You are free to discuss your own history of dieting with a trigger warning, but do not promote it.

&#x200B;

* Be mindful of language, as fatphobia (and internalized fatphobia) lives within all of us and is caused by societal conditioning that we are working on forgoing. Avoid using words like ""obese"" or ""overweight,"" and avoid use of the BMI scale, as it is inherently fatphobic (check out the book Fearing the Black Body for more information about BMI and fatphobia/racism).

&#x200B;

* We try to use neutral terms for food and our bodies. It can be very challenging to let go of diet-culture, but we do our best. Instead of using words like healthy/unhealthy, good/bad, clean/dirty, healthy/junky, junk food, garbage food, and trash food to describe food, try using the works \*POWER\* foods (nutrient-dense foods, whole foods) and \*PLEASURE\* foods (foods that may not provide many nutritional benefits but that are enjoyable).

My intuitive eating journey,36,st7bj7,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/st7bj7/my_intuitive_eating_journey/,6,"TW: details of my disordered eating days

I have come a really long way in my intuitive eating journey and wanted to share my story to give some inspiration to anyone who is new to or struggling with intuitive eating.

When I was in high school I ran cross country and track all year round. I used to get awful cramps sometimes during practice. My solution to this problem was to not eat for three hours before practice or before a race. This is the first I remember trying to control my food intake.

I had a difficult freshman year of college and was pretty lonely. My first semester, at the school where I went, each meal included an entree, a bag of chips, a piece of fruit, and a soda. Since all of this was included, I always took everything and I always ate all of it. It seemed a waste not to.

My second semester, I transferred schools. I joined the running club and every day after practice, I and some of my friends from the club would eat dinner together. There was a culture of eating a ton of food after our runs, so I always stuffed my tray, even though at this school the dining halls at this new school charged by item, not by all-inclusive meal. One of the girls I ate with had a history of anorexia. Looking back, we were all disordered eaters on some level. This is pretty common in sports.

I remember freshman year I didnt keep any food in my room, but when I had urges to binge, I would sometimes eat my roommate's food. My logic was that even if I binged, I wouldn't let myself eat as much of her food than if it was my own because I didnt want her to notice. Needless to say, I felt extremely guilty every time I stole her food. 

I continued binging throughout college, often while staying up late trying to finish an essay that I had procrastinated. I was also binge drinking which didnt help because I tended to binge eat when I got home from a night out drinking. At some point I started purging too because I was literally making myself sick and I felt disgusting. My stomach felt awful and I felt guilty and it felt like the only way to feel a little better.

These habits continued past college and into my twenties. I was becoming exercise addicted and running six or seven days a week no matter how I was feeling. I was pretty much eating all day long. I had completely lost track of my hunger cues and would be constantly looking at the clock until enough time had passed that it felt acceptable to eat again. I was still drinking, not excessively but habitually, and drinking often led to my worst binges. 

All the time I was doing this I somehow didn't acknowledge to myself what I was doing. I knew that  I felt out of control around food and I wished that I could eat socially without being hyper focused on the food itself. I envied people who could sit in front of a bowl of chips and not continuously eat them.

I realize now that the reason it took so long for me to acknowledge I had a problem was because I was surrounded by disordered eaters. Once you start IE, you realize just how many people engage in some disordered eating behaviors. It's just about everyone!

When I was 24 or so I read the book ""Brain over Binge"" written by an author who had recoveted from bulimia. The basis of her strategy was like ""just don't do it"" which sounded appealing but didn't help me.

It wasn't until about 2 years ago that I discovered intuitive eating. All the time I was engaging in disordered eating behaviors I thought that I was gluttonous and out of control. Realizing that it was my restrictive mindset that was triggering my urges to binge was huge. I started allowing myself to eat. Knowing that I could always have the food later if I wanted it helped me get rid of my scarcity mindset. And recognizing the different types of hunger helped me realize I don't have to be starving to eat. In fact, it's better to eat before I get extremely hunger because I'll be more in tune with my hunger signals.

Now, I can go to a social gathering where there is food and take what I want without worrying about missing out on something I didn't put on my plate. I enjoy my meals more because I ask myself what my mind and body want every time I go to eat. I can eat my old fear foods in moderation or turn them down altogether if I'm not in the mood for them. I can have a drink or two and still stay in touch with my hunger cues. I can eat dinner with friends and focus on the conversation and not the food. 

I started my disordered eating when I was 14 and I'm now 27. I still struggle with labeling foods as good or bad and I go a little overboard with gentle nutrition. I have trouble tuning into my hunger cues sometimes. Some of my harder to break food rules rear their ugly heads still. But I no longer feel like food is ruling my life, and I *never* binge or purge anymore and haven't for years. 

I hope those of you who are new on your journey have read this and can see that it is possible to change your relationship with food. IE is a continuous process but it works and you can do it.",1644943695.0

what is the shape of progress?

a bit over a week ago i started IE because even though I wasn't that physically restricted, my mind was completely consumed by food. like, every waking moment. after the first few days of extreme hunger and obsessively thinking about all the food i COULD eat now, i started to feel almost completely like my old self again. it was great! it was a blissful few days and i was so hopeful it would last.

however, i quickly became been plagued by intrusive thoughts about relapsing to my previous mental state and about if i could really trust my bodily cues. i also became very tearful/depressed, i guess because the depression that the food obsession was distracting me from never went away. yesterday it reached a low since my IE journey began when i was irrationally convinced that eating ANYTHING would make me fat and i started glancing at calorie labels. i started to feel a shadow of the old bingeing impulse again. 

my question is, if progress isn't linear, what IS its shape? i read somewhere that it's like an outward spiral or something. did you guys go through anything similar? how did you FULLY embrace unconditional permission and stop mental restriction once and for all?",1644937530.0

I've noticed it needs way less food than I thought to be satisfied, and if I eat just what my body needs, I won't feel uncomfortable for hours after a meal. It's a massive learning curve after effectively a lifetime of dieting, but it's a big step into recovery!

I've also noticed that I just don't crave sweet things anymore. Maybe my body's connected the fact that I feel awful if I eat some very sweet things, and that it knows it can have whatever it wants. I've had 2 shelves in my room completely stocked with chocolates, biscuits, jellies, you name it. Even mince pies from Christmas! But I just haven't had the cravings since buying them. It's... A bit sad, because I bought all of this cause I like them. Maybe I'll try to incorporate them a bit at a time with meals? 

Thanks to noticing what my body wants and needs to be satisfied, I'm not so sure I want to keep a meal plan. I barely ever stick to it anyways, so maybe just making like a list of meals I can make from a weekly grocery shop will be enough

i’ve been intuitively eating for the best part of a year, but in isolation with covid i’m really struggling to resist the urge to restrict. the issue is that i live in a shared house, none of whom have to self isolate, so our arrangement is that i’m just letting them know when i want to use the kitchen for meals so they can clear out and let me grab some food.
i’m super aware of not depriving them from using the kitchen/living space for too long, so looking for meals that are both quick to assemble and satisfying is hard.

a lot of medical anxiety also means that i’m losing some motivation to take care of myself, so it’s becoming tricky to afford myself the joys of a nutritious meal. if anyone has any support on how to get over this hurdle, or even suggestions of quick, satisfying meals i would be incredibly grateful!",1644832736.0
Getting back the joy of movement,16,ss6p4l,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/ss6p4l/getting_back_the_joy_of_movement/,4,"I've gone a long way in separating exercise from weight and shame. There are a few types of moment I thoroughly enjoy now. I struggled to put my goal into words, but yesterday I had a series of childhood memories resurface. Usually I don't remember my childhood fondly, there was a lot of trauma from my family and a lot of bullying from other kids. But yesterday I remembered the joy I felt when I was moving my body.

I remember being just so tiny and chasing pigeons on the town square for what seemed like hours as my mom sat in a cafe with a friend. I remember how bored I was with walking and just ran when I could and skipped and jump when couldn't. I climbed any rock I could scramble up on. I carefully balanced on the curb whenever someone let me. I loved the monkey bars, I loved just jumping up to grab a bar, turning upside down, hook the knees and swing back and forth, laughing maniacally. I remember badgering my mom to go swimming all summer long, then refusing to go out of water every time. Then there was this wedding anniversary of some relatives I didn't know, they rented out this big hall and I was so bored I decided to do 500 cartwheels - and the difficult part was the counting. It felt like I weight nothing at all, even though I was actually a fat kid. My muscles must have been powered by an inexhaustible reserve of rocket fuel.

But I also remember other kids laughing at me for jiggling as I ran. I also remember being the only girl who could do a pull-up - and the only kid that got called into the office after they took out those fat measuring calipers. And how I was just so alone. Shamed for how my joy of movement inconvenienced adults, then the bad stuff at home, then the bullying... I did my best to turn into a rock.  Do nothing. Think nothing. Feel nothing. Need nothing.

I started breaking out of that, though. Quite recently, I started freeing my body too. I just want to go back to that. To be able to implicitly trust my body to be able to do whatever I think up, feeling invincible. Climbing stuff, doing crazy stunts. Feel good when I'm moving and moving because it feels good. I'm constantly holding back, afraid of getting hurt, injury prone as I am. My body feels heavy on me and I'm afraid of being too weird. I'm not sure if I can feel quite like that again (for one, I now understand that falling from high places isn't all that fun), but maybe I can get close. I'm still trying to figure out how, though. I'm not sure why I'm posting this. Just thinking, I guess.",1644831225.0

I had a terrible hypoglycemic episode a couple of days ago that scared the … out of me. I am done exercising, counting macros/calories and just want to feel normal again. I have had zero testosterone/libido for 2 years now and I’m ready to live happy. 
I have been eating good for the last 2 days and the extreme hunger has kicked in. I’ve had extreme anxiety since the hypoglycemia thing the other night where I had extreme fatigue, shakiness, clammy ness etc. I immediately consumed a piece of cake and had the worst chills, jitters and panic attack. Since then I’ve been battling these panic attacks and anxiety.

After learning about intuitive eating, I delicately tried it out. While it took me a long time to actually convince myself to follow its principals, it saved my life! I thought I would never be free from having food looming over my brain at all hours a day. Now, I've been able to go about my day, buy all the yummy food that I want, and food isn't on my mind 24/7.

I even notice I care about the way my body looks less. First - my size is flunctuating a lot less now that I'm giving my body consistent food :). I feel like I'm able to appreciate my body for the fact that this is the size I am healthiest at - mind AND body.

It's definitely not perfect, and sometimes I'll catch myself feeling guilty for craving something that's ""not so good"" for me. But when I allow myself to eat it all I want, it takes away that secret pleasure in doing something you're not supposed to do.

Now, about my mom. She told me I need to start thinking about my health and not to gain anymore weight. She said since she’s my mom, she’s the only person who can say this. My mom has always commented on my weight whether I was big or small. I used to listen to her and try to gain or lose weight based on what she said. Since my mom is a nurse I always took what she said about health/weight seriously. In mid-2020 I stopped because I realized I was letting her control my body. So today when she made the comment, I laughed because I’m gonna do what I want with my body. I also told her my body is fine and I’m okay. Then I told her I understand what she’s saying is coming from a well-intentioned place, but I’d prefer if she didn’t comment on my weight, I’m sensitive about it, and I’m working on it. She understood and told me she wouldn’t again. Then she told me how she liked that I was honest with her.

The whole thing was light-hearted, but when I said how I felt I was firm. I’m just proud that I stood up for myself. Thank you therapy! Lol

newbie,7,sosr3j,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/sosr3j/newbie/,9,"Just started ""intuitive"" eating today after prolonged restriction. I heard it's normal at the beginning to want to eat all of the no-no foods that once were limited or restricted, that it's part of the process. Eventually, this mindset will change and the urge to eat them will lessen.

I've restricted myself so much in the past that I find it frightening giving myself freedom as the restriction indubitably leads to binging/overeating which is a huge problem I've had in the past. I'd be interested to hear stories of those who are more experienced with IE that can give me some insight into how they ditched their habits of overeating.

Due to my strained relationship with food, I find it extremely difficult to sense hunger cues and satiety cues. For the latter, I believe I should exercise eating more satiating foods at a slower pace. But because of intermittent fasting and restriction, I have forgotten how to sense hunger. I noticed I can go a whole day without eating and not experience ""hunger"" because for so long I've only viewed food as an aid to help me look a certain way or to satisfy my emotional hunger.

I also would like to start building muscle and I know a lot of that is based off performance and progressive overload. I know eating high protein sources whilst practicing IE will definitely yield me strength and muscle, but sometimes I worry the effort I put in exercising may go down the drain if I don't eat sufficiently.

Major realization: Guilt,30,snes7e,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/snes7e/major_realization_guilt/,10,"Guilt has been holding me back so much. It’s the reason why I’ve been trying to do IE for so long and still not quite getting to the point of normal, mindless (in a good way), eating. Just because I feel guilty for not eating perfectly intuitively instead of for not eating perfectly on a diet doesn’t mean it’s not as bad. The negative emotions I had let myself feel/didn’t fight perpetuated the food thoughts and guilt. My life still largely revolved around food. The thoughts led to subconscious restriction and overeating/binges. I would try to eat “perfectly intuitively” and always fail. Normal people don’t have tiktok what I eat in a day meals. They eat whenever, whatever. If someone offers them a snack, they take it. If they overeat to discomfort by accident, they don’t spend all day and part of the next thinking about it and how they’ll do better next time. 

This week I’ve been eating a lot and often to discomfort but I’m not feeling guilty anymore and I feel so free. Like it really doesn’t matter at all what I eat. I’m eating to satisfaction every time, literally whatever I want and even though I’ve been uncomfortable a lot that has decreased as my body has been realizing that I will keep eating and give it food whenever, even if I don’t have the perfect hunger levels or timing. Before I would often try to stop myself once I had an “appropriate” portion (or feel guilty if I didn’t stop), spurring more eating because of those negative emotions, but I don’t care anymore and it’s the most amazing feeling. The “intuitive eating” I was doing before still helped me heal a lot of my relationship with food (like I really was trying) but I feel like I’ve finally found the missing puzzle piece and broken free.

Relapse in mental health and struggling with IE,12,sncs8r,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/sncs8r/relapse_in_mental_health_and_struggling_with_ie/,13,"Hello everyone,

I learned about IE about a year ago (read the book). I sort of eased into it for a few months after that. but I have been putting lots of effort into it for 6 months now. It has gone really really well for me. I used to have BED (diagnosed) and I never binge anymore. Just enjoy the treats I want when I want. I have gotten back into sports I love since I don’t use exercise exclusively for weight loss anymore. I have been able to accept and feel confident in my body for the first time in many many years. 

This is all great but about 3wks ago I seem to have had a regression with my mental health. This has resulted in me struggling with keeping my apartment clean. When my apartment isn’t clean I don’t cook. Since I’m not cooking much I haven’t been buying many groceries. I don’t make much money so I avoid eating out (even a drive through) as much as possible. So basically I’m barely eating all day. Then in the evening when I’m weak and shaky I just eat chocolate and some random stuff I can grab for dinner (like plain bread). FYI I don’t have an issue with eating the chocolate, I don’t feel guilty about it or anything. What I do have an issue with is the lack of eating throughout the day. I’ve tried keeping some food in the fridge at work that doesn’t require preparation (like cracker carrots and hummus) but sometimes on my break it feels like I have a block from eating. I’ll feel hungry before my break then when I sit down I can hardly get myself to eat. I force myself to have at least a few crackers. 

I’m really not sure what to do at this point. Not eating puts me in a bad mood in the second half of my shift and today I felt a bit dizzy before my drive home (I bought some juice so that I didn’t drive in that state). I’m working on getting my place clean but it’s hard for me to maintain right now. It’s tough because I don’t have much energy from lack of eating so I can’t get my place clean and when it’s not clean I struggle with eating. 

I can’t afford any therapy right now but I have an EAP at work that I think has free counselling so I’ll look into that. 

I’m honestly not sure what my question is. I’m just looking for some advice and support from this amazing  community. Thanks so much to anyone who had read this far.",1644299989.0

I have spent several years with moderate social isolation and a mild form of chronic fatigue and assorted physical and psychological issues that came with it. I gained a lot of weight because activity was barely possible even though my body wanted to, and I needed to eat substantially to function at all. Doctors concentrated on advice to eat less and did not believe my symptoms. 

I have managed to escape from this trap and I am now on an upwards trend in all aspects of my life. Unsurprisingly, my weight goes down and I do enjoy that after all the pressure.

The experience is definitely weird but something I was not expecting is how much it’s made me think about my relationship with food! On the one hand, it’s actually been really healing. I always struggled with binge eating and having snacks where I felt I had absolutely no control around. Now that I can’t taste anything it’s like all my fear foods have no power over me and I am actually focusing on how foods make me feel, my bodies cues that it’s hungry or full. As much as it sucks not being able to taste or smell, I’m kind of loving this unique time to tune into how food makes me feel physically as opposed to emotionally.

On the other hand, it’s also kind of destroyed my appetite and that’s caused me to slip into a lot of bad thought patterns. I’ve noticed myself sort of tracking what I’ve eaten, estimating calories, kind of hoping that maybe I’m losing weight and maybe this will continue.

Any advice on how to handle the ups and downs would be really appreciated. I feel like I’ve been making a lot of progress with my relationship with my body and I don’t want to slip up now.

how do i know if i'm actually hungry,7,skyfhc,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/skyfhc/how_do_i_know_if_im_actually_hungry/,10,"Hi, for reference I am a 21 y/o woman in college. If you read to the end, I appreciate it! TW: Mention of b\*nge eating, d\*sordered eating

First a little backstory: Throughout my middle, high school and college years, I would usually eat until I'm uncomfortably full. Though I've never been formally diagnosed with an ED, I have definitely struggle with various forms of disordered eating. I used to be able to eat quite a lot in one sitting (although it would be overeating). I also used to have a little more muscle back in high school, but I have lost it in college, especially during COVID.

I assume it's the loss in muscle mass and growing out of the ravenous teenage years (by ravenous I mean teens are still growing so they obviously eat more) that has caused me to have a smaller appetite overall. I also am more sedentary now compared to my teen years, again even more so now bc of COVID.

However, I feel like my appetite is always changing. I just came back to college from winter break, and during break I think I ate less than I usually do(not purposely, I wasn't as hungry because I was extremely sedentary all break and didn't go out). But now since coming back to college, I'm still very much sedentary but I find myself wanting to eat more. I don't know if it's eating not as great food at home vs the freedom of eating food I cooked or bought myself. But I have been struggling with overeating the past few days. I really do try to eat until I'm satisfied but not too full that I feel heavy, but I find that I get hungry pretty quickly. But I also get satisfied pretty quickly too. It seems that my stomach can only handle smaller portions at a time, but it's annoying to eat a small meal then get hungry in an hour or 2. I don't have the time or patience to be snacking on small meals all day.

Another thing to note, sometimes I'm not sure if I can follow my hunger cues. For ex, my stomach will feel hungry and ache/burn but in the moment, my brain doesn't feel like I want to eat. But I'll eat anyway since I get the hunger cues, and once I start to eat, it's like it flips a switch and then I feel myself wanting to eat, or perhaps just flavor chasing?

What do I do? I want to intuitively eat, but it is honestly harder than it sounds.

PS: I don't eat super super healthy, but I wouldn't say I eat super unhealthy. Definitely not fast food/takeout everyday, and I try to get in veggies and have healthier alternatives when I can. I have been eating a lot of processed food/takeout this past week though since that's what I had at home and this week I had a few social commitments.

How weighing yourself can negatively tip the balance on your intuitive eating journey!,32,sjmi9e,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/sjmi9e/how_weighing_yourself_can_negatively_tip_the/,10,"I initially posted this on the weight talk Thursdays thread but a moderator suggest I post here instead! Hope this provides some useful insight into my own intuitive eating experience/ can help others in their own battle with the scales! (NOTE - This is my own personal experience and may not be appropriate or applicable to everybody)

I began my intuitive eating journey well over a year a go during the final year of my university degree and in the middle of the pandemic. For some, this might have seemed like a really challenging time to begin this journey. But for me, it was actually ideal, I was busy with my studies but also not really in view of the outside world apart from my family so I really had no difficulties. The hardest part for me, was not using the scale to measure my weight - and I can't emphasise the importance of this enough for what I'm about to explain!

A year on into my intuitive eating journey it's Dec 2021 I started a job in September and due to a break out of COVID in the office we were instructed to work from home in late November, I was not and am currently not enjoying my new job. Around December I experienced the usual pressures that an intuitive eater might experience around Christmas time/ into January when all of the diet talk appears about of nowhere. Due to stress and different emotions from my job, I began to stress eat / I began weighing myself again. **I strongly advise that if the scale has a negative impact on you, like it does me! Please do not get into the habit of weighing yourself again, I feel like it just compounds all of the stress and negative emotion you might experience!**. So, this week, I stopped weighing myself on Wednesday, and despite being in this current unfortunate employment situation where I am currently looking for a new job, the ""weight"" lifted from me mentally by not weighing myself everyday and hence, it has stopped dictating my emotions and so forth. 

It has been such a relief my conscience, because in one way, when you weigh yourself each day I don't think you realise how much it impacts you for the rest of the day. Especially if its not the ""number"" you want to see, and in saying this, as someone with a past of disordered eating you have to be honest with yourself, will seeing that particular number on the scale, ever be the ""ideal number"", not from my own experiences. I just wanted to share this, and I suppose if you really can't abandon the scale, at least at the maximum amount , if you have to, don't weigh yourself more than once a month. I hope to keep this up into the future! Good luck on your intuitive eating journeys 😊",1643903436.0

Some history on my eating habits: I had a background of clean eating—literally nothing processed, ever—that made me feel great and energized until I noticed how much weight I had lost, and thus began the restriction cycle. 

I have decided to weigh myself every Wednesday to have some data on what this process looks like for me. I am healing my relationship with my body and the scale. You may not agree, but it’s working for me.  

It’s been nothing short of food wonderland. My grocery cart looks sane again: a balance of veg and ice cream, fruits and crackers, popcorn and yummy treats. I am lucky in that I do crave nutritious foods: my favorite breakfast is scrambled eggs or shakshuka with toast.

Today I ate what I wanted. That included a dinner of 2 helpings of pot pie, 2 chocolate chip cookies, nearly the entire pint of b&j ice cream (though I stopped when I was full, there’s only 4 spoonfuls left), and half a chocolate covered banana. I talked myself through it and made sure I was okay. This is a win for me as just last week, I was weighing out my olive oil. OLIVE OIL!!! 

I will not let food define me, I know that I have to heal this part of me. I have felt like shit in the mornings (physically) when I eat a lot of ice cream, which has been nearly every day this week as I never ate it before, but I am honoring my cravings and teaching my body that I will never restrict it again.

For background info, I have struggled with depression off and on for about 10 years (since early middle school). Every time I go into a depressive episode, I tend to binge and eat food that doesn’t make me feel good, but use it as a coping mechanism for my depression. And every time my mental health improves, my body slowly adjusts and goes back to where it naturally wants to be, but I’ve never actually slowed down enough to realize how my body feels.

I got out of my last depressive episode in June and started actively making an effort to eat intuitively since September (in the past I’ve given myself food freedom but I’ve never implemented the other aspects of intuitive eating like gentle nutrition or joyful movement). For the first time in my life, I’m actually noticing how foods make me feel. I’ve learned that chocolate makes my stomach hurt and I don’t feel great when i eat dairy products, but for some reason i feel fine when i eat greek yogurt (and tbh I do still consume chocolate and dairy products lol).

TW: POSSIBLE DISORDERED EATING HABITS

whenever i try to talk to her about this, she refutes it by saying that i can't say anything because of my previous extremely disordered eating habits. 

- eats while standing up at the counter while everyone else is sitting down at the table, there are empty seats, etc. there is no rush to be anywhere.

- also, when everyone else is at the table, ready to eat, she will start cleaning up. we must wait 10-20 mins for her or just start eating.

- only uses small plates. ?? this was something i did when i was hella disordered. it was pretty triggering but now it's just irritating.

- she skips lunch or eats dessert instead if nobody is eating lunch at the time she wants to. this is difficult because i wake up at 8, she at 6, my brother at 10. we can't all eat at the same time. 

- complains about the food (to us, not waiters lol. i love her--she's not that bad) every single time we eat out. too expensive. too bland. she can do it better.

- makes everyone feel so guilty about leaving food on their plate with passive aggressive comments

How to stop binging??,46,sglhk9,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/sglhk9/how_to_stop_binging/,25,"Everyone always says that when you first start intuitive eating, you binge because you’ve been restricting yourself for so long, but this is not true at all for me. I’ve (tried) intuitive eating since the summer and I’ve been eating any food I desire, no restrictions. But I just can’t stop binge eating, for example I will try to put peanut butter on my yogurt to make it more filling, but it just makes me want to eat the whole jar.

Edit: Something I should add is that ever since I started IE, the fact that I could eat anything I wanted got me into the mindset that I have to try EVERY new food I have access to even if I’m not craving it at the moment, and it seems counter-intuitive because intuitive eating is meant to bring people out of the “scarcity” mindset.",1643583601.0

If it’s a weekend and I’m craving something late at night, I don’t stop myself. These used to be binges, packing in as much as I could but with intuitive eating I’ve gotten a lot better and typically only do it if I’m hungry and order an amount of food that maybe isn’t small but it’s not a full-on binge either. 

I’ve noticed that if I do this and I’m hungry early in the morning I feel guilty and like I’m not allowed to be hungry. I also feel gross, like I can’t eat anything somewhat similar or it will be wrong. Also, I will have a little bit of indigestion despite having an empty stomach and feeling the cues to eat and it makes me even more grossed out. 

For example, last night I got a breakfast sandwich from whataburger and now I feel like if I eat a savory breakfast that will be wrong and I can’t. My stomach growled and I’m hungry (gross alert) but I burped and it tasted like the food from last night so I’m even more put off.

TW: no numbers but mentions of exercise, weight change.

TL;DR -- eating intuitively & lifting heavy/frequently but not gaining muscle & proper strength. 

i lift weights 4x a week for 1.5 hours each, x1 a week for 1 hour, and do cardio x1 a week for 1 hour. i've been following this routine for 6 months.

that makes 8 hours working out per week. 1 hour cardio and 7 hours lifting.

and i do enjoy it! it makes me feel powerful, energized, and i've been lifting heavier and heavier each week.

however, physically, i have not been gaining muscle or weight in general. i feel like i should be because the weight i'm lifting has been increasing every week. i want to get stronger but fear my nutrition is lacking.

i'm afraid i'm not getting enough food but i eat what i want when i am hungry and stop when i am full. i eat all foos groups. 

i am wary of eating TO change my body. but i do know i should be gaining muscle... although it is not my goal for working out, i definitely want to gain strength and size

honestly, just lost

During the 12-18 month treatment I'll be expected to keep the aligners in my mouth for 22 hours a day. I would only take them out to eat or drink (anything besides water) and will have to brush my teeth and floss before putting them back in. First-hand accounts I've read say that snacking becomes so inconvenient that it's pretty much not an option. People also report that certain foods are especially inconvenient because of how they stick to the teeth or get stuck in between. 

I snack whenever I want and on whatever I want. I have no restriction and, as a long-time IE practitioner, I don't need it. My cravings are balanced and I'm in perfect harmony with them. You can probably see why I'm a bit nervous of how this might change.

I’m in a bit of a weird situation I live with my Dad who’s mostly on the road and my stepmom now. My stepmom though is the real problem she’s always on some diet. Currently it’s 3 day fasts, I don’t really care about her diets they don’t bother me, to each their own. I do feel like she judges the things/amounts I eat. There is never any food in my house besides cheezits and yogurt which only do so much for me (dinner is good though, she likes to cook for my dad). I know for a fact that I go out and buy snacks and end up eating way too much of them because there isn’t food that actually satisfies me and I’m not going to say anything to them because they act as if they don’t know how to parent. My Dad is always at work and my stepmom is home all day yet she never asks me if I’m hungry, or if I need anything at the grocery store without me asking. Plus I’m almost an adult so might as well get an early start. 

Good thing is I do get an allowance from my mom who lives out of state and it wouldn’t be hard to keep some snacks/food in my room or small stuff in the fridge.

Struggling recently,9,sedznb,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/sedznb/struggling_recently/,5,"
Hey everyone. I hope this is the right place to post this, I figured you folks would have some good advice and interesting thoughts. I think I trust this sub and it’s potential input more so than other food related subs. I also just want to mention again that this post contains discussion of disordered eating and mentions weight loss and dieting.

In my teenage years I would say I had an eating disorder: I restricted a LOT in order to lose weight (typical influence of diet culture specifically towards women/ girls) and this led to me developing a binge eating disorder. I was never diagnosed but looking back that’s exactly what it was. In the last 3-4 years I would say I have almost fully recovered from it - with the help of feminist thinking/ intuitive eating/ general being nice to myself. 

However, I am realising more and more that I am nowhere near fully recovered. I try to intuitively eat now which has been going really well but recently I feel like I’ve been quite confused with knowing how my body is feeling and what it wants. To preface: I recently started doing a lot more exercise than usual (not at all for weight loss purposes but as it helps with my dissociation and depression, and also because I want my lungs to be stronger and just to feel more capable of doing the things I want to do.) So I’ve been rock climbing for six ish months which has been great, and in the last few weeks Ive started to do Muay Thai. I also walk/hike a lot because I enjoy it. As a result of this I think my body has needed a lot more food, but this still scares me somewhat. I try to eat enough (Ive pretty much doubled the amount of food I eat) but I still find myself feeling super hungry and almost wanting to binge. Sometimes I don’t want to eat more because I’m tired and want to sleep, but I feel that old feeling coming back of my body just wanting more and more. And I am fine with this but I struggle with feeling it because it reminds me of binging. I have noticed myself subconsciously restricting i.e not buying ice cream when I wanted it, making excuses to check calories, limiting the amount of bread I eat. 

On top of this, my flatmate has recently started a diet in order to lose weight. I find it very restrictive as he cannot have any carbs, and he exercises every day and talks a lot about how much weight he has lost and the fact that he can’t eat carbs. Even before the diet he would talk a lot about how he ate ‘like shit’ which I didn’t like. I think it has all really triggered me. Even seeing him visually lose weight just makes me feel unsafe and uncomfortable. I was thinking of asking him not to talk about his diet/ weight around me because it is triggering, but I wonder if that could be interpreted as rude or controlling? 

Essentially, I am starting to feel ‘out of control’ around food and my body again and it’s making me very sad. I want to do right by my body and give it the nourishment it needs. I’m just finding it quite hard at the moment for the above reasons and was wondering if anyone had some thoughts or advice? Thanks for reading!",1643331694.0

However I also understand that IE is also somewhat about listening to your body when it’s full. Is this something you want to start out right away practicing, or is it okay to just take in everything you’ve deprived yourself of for so long even if you get full? It felt kind of like a binge, or kind of like what I would have treated as a “cheat day” when I was restricting.

I just started intuitive eating today,35,sdix2v,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/sdix2v/i_just_started_intuitive_eating_today/,21,"So I’m a senior in high school, and back around October / November, my body image issues really started acting up again. Being surrounded by diet culture and all the social expectations for girls and their bodies in high school, I of course wanted to change my body and be thin.

So early in November I started counting my calories. My BMR was 1200, so I thought “Okay so I have to eat less than what I burn, I’ll shave a couple hundred off that” (obviously very unhealthy), and started eating between 600-800 calories a day. 

Within only a few weeks, I had lost all my water weight and found out I was actually a pound above what would be underweight for my height and age. I didn’t care, I wanted to lose more for some reason (luckily I didn’t). 

Christmas came and I decided “I’ll just have a cheat day” which turned into binge eating all throughout the entirety of my winter break. I gained back all the water weight, and when I tried to go back to restricting in the new year, I just couldn’t. Every day I’d finish out by restricting, and then blacking out and binging.

So over the past couple days, I learned what intuitive eating was while researching binge eating disorders. Today I decided to stop counting my calories. I remember as a younger kid, I’d eat what felt right in the moment, and I stayed a healthy weight. I want to go back to that.

I'm hungry for a specific type of cheese and I'm not sure why,28,scc9j8,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/scc9j8/im_hungry_for_a_specific_type_of_cheese_and_im/,61,"Typically, I can consider ""what if I were to substitute"" for some foods and then I can get a sense of what my body wants out of the food that I feel a desire to eat. Usually if I have a desire to eat cheese and I'm content by the idea of substituting something like meat or tofu then I probably want the protein and if something like peanut butter seems like it'd fit then I'm probably being drawn to the fats and oils.

But for a few days now I've been hungry for a medium cheese. It's easy enough for me to go to the grocery store in the next few days and get some cheese that'll work but I can't recall the last time I couldn't identify the aspect of what I was hungry for by thinking of reasonable substitutions.

What could my body be wanting of a sharp cheddar cheese that I couldn't get from the following:

 - hard cheese (like Manchego)

 - soft cheese (like Brie)

 - veggie hotdogs

 - canned sardines


If the solution is just ""go get some cheese that fits"" then that's fine but I'd like to understand why and I'm curious if I'm overlooking some micro-nutrient that my body is trying to get me to locate.

Edit: adjusting flair from ""advice"" to ""joyful movement"" - I'm not really sure what the best way to ask for advice is; I've been eating intuitively for ~30 years but only in the last ~4 have I had trouble figuring out what I'm hungry for.

Edit 2: I may have asked my question in the wrong subreddit - I'm not asking for permission to eat this cheese - I'm content with eating it and I'm sure I'll get around to going to the store to get it. It's just that I'm not used to having a hunger for a particular food that couldn't be substituted. The method of thinking of the possible substitutes has worked for so long that it's really unusual to have something that won't sub.

I think this would be useful for anyone who has experienced body trauma (injury, surgery, acute or chronic illness), copes with mental health struggles or ADHD, or anyone looking for clarity if they feel stuck on their journey.

I'd like to focus my energy on eating foods that make me feel physically better, even if that means I continue to gain for a while.

I would like to hear what snacks, meals, or anything else you have been eating that you have been enjoying lately so I can start adding some more nutrition back into my foods.

&#x200B;

I have a young son (almost 6). When he was very young and we were starting him on solids, I was verrrrrry much still in diet culture and my husband and I really aspired to have him eating a very low-sugar and no ""junk"" diet.  Eventually this started to backfire on us (full disclosure, he got in trouble at daycare when he was \~3 for eating cookies another kid had dropped on the floor, that was my wakeup call that my approach was not sustainable).  Around this time I started to discover Intuitive Eating for myself and also reading more seriously about Division of Responsibility (DOR, which I would describe as an IE-compatible method of feeding kids).  I started letting more of my kid's pleasure foods (graham crackers, goldfish, gummies) into the house, and we also started to enjoy more baking together.  He was initially pretty obsessed, if he was aware we had a box of graham crackers, he was desperate to have them all the time. After lots of reading and some trial and error we eventually settled on a sweets frequency that seemed to kind of work--he gets a small sweet at both lunch and dinner every day, and then he sometimes gets a few M&Ms in his trail mix or chocolate chips instead of blueberries in his muffins at snacktime, and then sometimes we also have bigger desserts like a slice of cake.  Increasing the frequency definitely helped with making my kid less frantic for more more more of sweets whenever they showed up, so that was awesome and it really felt like we were making progress.  However, there was nooooooo way he would ever not ask for his post-meal ""sweet"" (for those of you familiar with DOR, technically dessert should be served with the meal, but kiddo really enjoys picking his own sweet and doing it with the meal was kind of chaotic, so we switched to after and it made things much calmer).  Well, for the past few weeks now, a couple of times each week he has just been so excited to go off and do something after his main course that he completely forgets to ask for a sweet.  Of course, on other days he remembers and is VERY interested :)

&#x200B;

I don't aspire to have a sugar-free kid anymore but I also want to feel that it isn't going to be a crisis if, say, we go to someone else's house for a meal and they don't serve dessert, so to have this happening feels like a major milestone.  I know also that some other parents on here have wondered if their kid's dessert obsession would ever end and...I think maybe it does?  Hang in there!",1642642632.0

When I'm hungry, or haven't eaten for a while, sometimes I will feel nauseous and/or like I'm already very full.

I really don't like feeling ill, and it's hard to determine whether or not I will feel more or less ill if I do eat. Hunger and fullness often feel the same to me. In addition, so many things seem to drive my appetite down these days, even though I try really hard to eat enough to keep my body going. 

I've tried tuning into my body and trying to sense how it feels, but I come out of it with a bunch of mixed signals and it feels very un-intuitive to me to try to determine what to do from there.

As we have changed our eating patterns (much for the better- mealtimes used to be a BATTLEGROUND), she has taken to relying on pleasure foods to the greatest degree possible.  She is an intense little soul and does usually take things to the extreme, so as I usually serve dessert with dinner, she frequently chooses that the only thing she will eat.  Which I understand may happen! But I do start to feel discomfort when this type of thing happens meal after meal.   I’ve also found her hiding candy in her room, which absolutely breaks my heart that she feels the need to hide it. 

I then feel torn and confused- do I lean further into IE, let her make choices for herself and trust and listen to her body? Or as a parent, I start to feel triggered into old ways of thinking, and that I need to “do more to ensure she’s eating a balanced diet”. 

I serve all meals family style with a wide variety of options for her to choose from. And honestly, it takes a ton of time, is expensive and is frustrating to make so many dishes for the two of us, and then she usually eats dessert and leaves.  But perhaps this is the process?

At my yearly check up a few months ago my doctor noticed elevated A1C that put me in the “pre diabetic” range.

I’ve read the 2020 Intuitive Eating book, have been doing IE for almost a year and have been seeing a dietitian since June, so I know a lot about IE’s worth, this is just new territory for me.

My Intuitive Eating journey has gone hand in hand with my journey of realizing how much doctors have neglected my health my whole life purely because of my weight. I’ve had multiple surgeries, gone to more specialists than I can count, and have been diagnosed with 3 “new” health conditions.

Unintentional weight loss,13,ryzka6,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/ryzka6/unintentional_weight_loss/,7,"Trigger warning: weight loss, numbers 

So some background first- I've been getting into intuitive eating since the summer. My pattern previous to that was generally try to eat ""healthily"" although not particularly calorie controlled but then when I was under stress to eat a lot of calorie dense pleasure foods for a few days and then repeat the cycle. I have written here before about my issues with chocolate. While I still love and enjoy chocolate and eat it frequently, I realise there was always a bit of a ""last supper"" mentality around it. 

Once I embraced intuitive eating (read the books and the workbooks), I definitely went through the phase of eating everything around me but I came out the other side of that and found I was craving a bit more vegetables and that I was feeling pretty awful physically after deep fried foods.

 I meal prep for 4 days of the week as I work long hours and I need to bring food with me as there's nowhere to get anything there. I try to make sure I prep meals I'm excited about eating - make large portions so that I can eat to fullness and that they have carbs, protein and fibre. Generally there's a lot of pasta and cheese involved.

In November,, I changed to a new job. It's less stressful so I'm not comfort eating as much and I'm also on my feet more. I've gone from maybe 5k to 10 or 11k steps in a day. I'm not exercising more generally. I had to get weighed when starting my new job as part of an occupational health assessment so I knew what I was then in late November.  I've noticed since I've lost a good bit of weight so weighed myself and I've lost 11lbs in 7 weeks. 

Now I'm worried that this is too much to have lost essentially accidentally in such a short time and I'm worried that there's an underlying cause for it- I'm going to get a check up at the doctor but I'm wondering if anyone else found they lost weight quickly when their eating habits balanced out?

TL:DR lost weight unexpectedly and worried underlying physical cause for it.

Edit: thank you all for your replies - I'm going to make an appointment just to be on the safe side but going to continue eating in ways that make me feel good!",1641647512.0

I was hungry and it was snack time anyway so I grabbed an apple. I was still hungry but I didn't feel like getting up to get something else, I thought I'd wait some time and grab something later. My mom likes to keep snacks under the living room table, even though she's not much of a snacker and I've binged on these in the past so yes, this particular area is quite triggering. But I wasn't feeling triggered this time. For the last few days I'd been doing well keeping things in balance. But then, something in me just snapped and I grabbed a box with these mini biscuits and started eating them right out of the box (boxes and packets also trigger binges for me, but like I said I had been doing okay for some time). And after a few bites when I snapped back into reality I tried to talk myself out of bingeing, but it's like this huge wave of pleasure hit me and I just didn't want to get off of it. 
I don't know if this was because I wanted to feel good to give myself temporary relief from my depression or because I'd sort of been labelling those very biscuits ""bad"" for the last few days and steering clear of them. But what's a real mystery to me is why it happened in the first place. I mindlessly picked up that box, which is now a common thing for me to do, but maybe it was too early to assume that my triggers have gone away? Maybe it was the hunger that put me on autopilot? Factoring in the movie, eating while distracted also probably had some role to play because I do get carried away and eat too fast while I'm distracted.

Figuring out this whole episode has been very distressing and has worsened my depressive episode. I'd appreciate some help from people on this sub.

For some context, I'm a former anorexic and I live in a country where we don't have access to proper therapy for EDs. I tried to recover on my own which resulted in a lot of binges. I'm now trying to practice IE (I'm a newbie and planning on reading the Reach and Tribole book soon) and stop bingeing for good, but I'm having trouble letting of go of the ""good and bad"" mentality and giving myself permission. Giving myself permission has been the hardest part because it makes me binge. I've made an appointment for therapy but in the meantime I want to understand my behaviour better.",1641642483.0
Hunger and desire for food are not aligned.,33,rydegc,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rydegc/hunger_and_desire_for_food_are_not_aligned/,6,"Hi everyone. Been doing IE for several years now but hitting a bit of a rough patch at the moment. I find that my desire to eat and my cravings for food are often not at all aligned with my actual hunger. So I’ll not be hungry at all but still in the mood to eat. 

Often I will eat when I feel this way, but I dislike the physical effects obviously. I’ll feel uncomfortably full or generally sort of sluggish if that makes sense? And when I am always eating in line with my desire to eat rather than my hunger cues I’ll basically end up never hungry at all. Now that I’m typing this I realize it isn’t necessarily a problem, but I still dislike it. Do you all think that’s disordered behavior? It feels like I’m always a little bit full and I don’t like that. 

On the flip side, when I try to eat to my hunger cues rather than only my desire for food, it begins to feel like I’m back in a pattern of disorder. I still am allowed to eat whatever I want, but I’m making an effort to wait to eat until I’m hungry. I find this makes me feel physically much better, but at times brings up disordered feelings because I’m “not allowing” myself to eat when I want to. 

What’s your take? Do you eat whenever you want to even if you’re not hungry? Would you do that if it meant you were always slightly full and somewhat sluggish feeling? Let me know.",1641578131.0

I am still holding on to this notion that if I weighed less I’d be happier, prettier, more popular, more outgoing, etc (basically all things I think I’m lacking). I’ve had this belief since I was very young so I can why it’s hard for me to let it go. I think a part of me is scared to let it go because it’s familiar and because I’m scared of gaining more weight. It’s a security blanket that’s “keeping me in check”. 

I’ve come along way on my IE journey and I’m proud of myself for that. I just wish I could somehow reframe my mindset.",1641536824.0

TW: diet & exercise talk

Forgive me if this has been posted about before.

Just been feeling real lonely these days since committing to my IE journey. Especially with the New Year I find many people in my circle so focused on the “new year, new me” trend (specifically to changing their bodies through diet & exercise). 

I’m the type of person who likes to be compassionate and listen to my friends especially if they are so excited for their new goals but I just find myself feeling a bit isolated. I’m proud of myself for not engaging in this triggering behaviour but I do wish I had some more IE people in my life.

So my mental hunger has been absolutely CRAZY lately but I’m proud of myself for honoring it. Of course my ED voice is always there trying to make me feel guilty but this time I won’t let her win. I often worry about the amount of food I can eat but I’m trying to trust the process, be curious and patient. I can’t deny weight gain still scares me since I’ve already gained a lot in less than one month, but I keep choosing recovery no matter how scared I am. 

Mental hunger can’t be ignored. So instead of judging a “great day” a day were I could eat clean and in moderation as I used to do before, now I try to see the good in giving in to my cravings. 

My biggest fear, insecurity and anxiety source is bloating though, I still struggle to accept it and deal with it. Any tips? Thank you😊

eating when not hungry during pregnancy?,1,ry7c10,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/ry7c10/eating_when_not_hungry_during_pregnancy/,7,"Hi guys. I'm currently almost 20 weeks pregnant. I've struggled with an Ed as a teenager. I find my hunger cues being pretty random right now, sometimes being starving, sometimes barely being hungry for 3 meals a day. I've gained about 6lb so far, and generally eat a well balanced diet. The thing is, I stop during a meal if I'm full, but I find myself eating a couple of snacks a day even when I'm not hungry. Is this OK? It's usually pretty nourishing stuff (fruit, veg or crackers with hummus, raw food bars, eggs, yogurt, nuts) But shouldn't I only eat when I'm hungry to avoid potential problems with my pregnancy like pre eclampsia? 

I've always been slim and have a pretty active job too, but iam only 4'11. I know intuitive eating isn't just about hunger and fullness, and I have no issue with occasionally eating for pleasure alone, but I'm having a hard time separating what is habitual eating for pleasure  and what is deciding to nourish my body even though I'm not physically hungry if that makes sense.

HOWEVER, I also definitely have a day-to-day ""food routine"" and certain gentle nutrition guidelines I try to meet.  Stuff like eating whole grains several times a day, getting protein a certain number of times per day.  I think I eat a pretty good variety of foods within that routine and have plenty of room for ""fun"" or less nutrient dense foods, but still...I'm probably pretty boring.  But it feels good and it works and if I stick to it I generally feel satisfied, and rarely get either too hungry or too full.

I find if I deviate too much from this routine, I just don't feel great.  Mainly I can get mega-constipated, so a pretty specific physical issue, not just generally feeling that I'm getting ""fat"" or something else more mental.  I do also find that with more unusual foods in the routine, it's harder for me to really figure out fullness signals and the result is often that I swing a bit further out into both under and over eating than I normally would.

Right now I'm on the tail end of a two week vacation.  My kid has been off school and my husband has been on vacation also.  We've had a lot more fun foods around and have also been doing a lot of family hikes which I love but also find challenging--my husband is the type who really wants to say ""fuck nutrition"" when we are on vacation or doing any sort of hard physical activity.  So if we go on a hike, he wants to have a baguette and cheese sandwich with potato chips for lunch.  His body can apparently handle it multiple days in a row, mine cannot.

I have actually hit a point in this vacation where I just can't deal with any more baguette and packed myself whole wheat avocado and egg sandwich with a side of veggie sticks for our latest hike.  This has happened before on family vacations, generally if it's more than 3-4 days, I need some return to ""normal"" (maybe not every meal, but some meals).

Does anyone else find they have gotten to this point?  Like even though mentally you are fine with eating anything and everything, you really prefer and feel physically better when you are in a routine?

I do acknowledge that we are on vacation I have less control over food (due to having to cater to everyone's tastes more, having to rely on restaurants more if we are travelling, having to eat stuff that can be packed in a backpack, etc.) so some of my negative reaction to vacation eating may be lingering control issues I need to work on.

Feeling hungry after I eat,14,rs7ej6,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rs7ej6/feeling_hungry_after_i_eat/,37,"TW: ED

I’m about 1-year into my IE journey, the first 6 months of which was spent doing the “refeeding” stage to recover from an ED. I dove into this full throttle, addressed feelings and root causes, worked through panic, etc. Once through re-feeding, I read the IE book as well as completed the workbook. I also went to group therapy for body image topics. I have also read other books which I’ll list at the bottom. 

All that said- I am still consistently experiencing stomach hunger about 30 minutes after I eat. This is very confusing to me for a number of reasons:
1- I eat plenty during my meal, and try to focus on satiating foods. I call it “Building a Plate”, but I try to include fat, a fiber-rich carb, protein, and liquid. I eat until I feel satisfied, but I don’t skimp on portions. Never have, never will
2- I drink plenty of water and electrolytes, but not excessive amounts like during ED
3- 90% of my regular hunger cues are not in my stomach, I don’t feel hungry, but rather I feel tension in my jaw/neck and if it gets too far I feel sleepy. 

What I’m trying to say is that I don’t believe this 30-min-post-meal-stomach-hunger is an actual hunger cue, so what is it? Does anyone have experience with this? Any recommendations? 

It’s really confusing me and I’m struggling with what to do. Often I feed it food but it never goes away, so lately I started ignoring it and after another 30-45 min it’ll go away but I am curious if there’s something else I should be doing. I don’t think ignoring it is framed in diet culture, I’m not ignoring it because I want to lose weight, I’m ignoring it because I’m sick of it. 

Other notes in case you ask:
-I have had recent [standard] bloodwork done and my tests are all good/normal. Blood sugars, cholesterol, etc. 
-I have not asked my GP because they don’t get it 
-I do not have a dietician or therapist because I can’t find one (there appears to be a massive shortage of people taking on new clients)
-I did just hire an IE Nutritionist but we’re not here yet…yes I know dietician is better but see above
-I have also read several HAES books, The F*ck It Diet, and have done the Mindful Eating Workbook. 
-During my ED phases this post-meal hunger also existed and it fueled my ED (orthorexia) further so I definitely would like to get to the bottom of it",1640886071.0

My IE Resolution for 2022: Treat myself like someone I'm responsible for helping,52,rrbgri,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rrbgri/my_ie_resolution_for_2022_treat_myself_like/,6,"I've mentioned before that I'm working with an IE dietician. I'm also going to be training for a half-marathon next year and getting back into yoga following the birth of my first child in December of 2020.

I've been reflecting on all the ways that I normally approach movement and food and wondering how I can better help myself reach sustainable, healthy, and intuitive goals in the new year.

The thought that came to me was ultimately this: my body is worthy of respect and appreciation. When it's tired, I should rest it. When I'm hungry, I should eat. When I'm full of energy, I should go for a run.

So on and so forth.

But the biggest thing is this: I am a person that I'm responsible for helping and taking care of. I can't explain why that idea seems to suddenly work so well for me, but it does. Which means, basically, that if I feel I've eaten too much of one type of food, I don't ""punish"" myself with another (or with nothing at all). I ask if I feel like I'm out of balance, or over-full, or uncomfortable and seek to find foods that make me feel better.

If I injure myself while running, I need to take care of the injury properly rather than beating up my body for ""failing"" me.

It’s so cool to realize that I’m actually eating when I’m physically hungry now and craving the food groups I actually need. And there’s no shame in that.

Stomach issues with play foods,3,rragey,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rragey/stomach_issues_with_play_foods/,5,"Hello! I have actively practiced IE in the past (successfully for several years!) and am trying to get back into it after an ED relapse. I would say I have been working towards IE for about a year this time.

I'm trying to incorporate more play food into my diet without shame. However, when I tune in to how they make me feel, they often don't make me feel too good. This leads to more guilt/shame and fear around those foods.

For example, I notice that even moderate amounts of salty or sugary foods can mess with my stomach. I feel bloated/uncomfortable and the bodily sensations lead to low mood/energy. It's frustrating because I have an ED/restrictive history and want to enjoy play foods/all foods as part of a varied diet without too many restrictions.

Often when I try a new/play food — getting a takeout burger, having a slice of cake, eating cereal instead of a protein-heavy breakfast etc — I have stomach issues afterwards. These leads to feelings of sadness and guilt. Eating something that makes my body feel less than great leads to concerns that I'm doing IE ""wrong.""

Unfortunately this guilt seems to have intensified the ""forbidden fruit"" effect of certain foods, and I find myself craving them more intensely, then feeling more guilty afterwards. Overall it feels like there's a lot of drama and shame around play foods, which is definitely not what I want! I also do suspect that some of my stomach issues may be due to my ED history/not being used to certain foods. 

How do I break this guilt cycle? Do I stop eating these play foods? Incorporate them more slowly? Or do I keep experimenting/noticing? For reference, I have read the book and workbook and see a therapist.

ive been practicing intutive eating for a couple of years now.  i'm a 28 yr old cis female. I just got out of a 4 year relationship where we barely had sex in the past couple years. there is a lot of reasons why we stopped having sex but one of them being that my ex struggled with the weight gain and his attraction towards me. i've gained 50 pounds in the past couple of years because of intuitive eating and starting an antidepressant, but i'm totally okay with it. i feel very neutral when it comes to my body for the first time in my life.

i ended my relationship about three weeks ago, and i'm thinking about having some fun and casually dating soon well, cause, it's been a while lol. but i'm terrified. i used to feel so confident in my body when i was thinner. now i feel like nobody is going to want to have sex with me. or i'm scared that once we start having sex, they will get turned off by my chubbiness.

it's weird because i feel like i've come such a long way with IE and body neutrality. but when it comes to dating again, i can't help but feel insecure. it prob stems from my ex and his thoughts about my body, and i am still working on healing from that.

I was diagnosed with Hashimotos and had gotten to a point where I was so fed up of the idea of being overweight due to my thyroid working against me. I told her I had spent the last 2 years working on my binge eating problems by intuitive eating and told her I’d like to stay close to those principles. She really respected it so this isn’t a case of her trying to convert me to strict dieting or anything but with Hashimotos comes the recommendation of low carb, gluten free, sugar free etc. I had a great first few months, lost loads of weight, my dark skin on my neck disappeared, my brain fog cleared up and I was feeling really positive.

I then, as with all restrictive diets, began to “be bold” and treat myself here and there to some sugar and gluten and extra carbs and before I knew it I was back to bingeing. I stopped going to her out of embarrassment and fear of being judged. Now I’m in a position where I feel like I’m back to my pre-intuitive eating days. 

I’m so mad at myself. When I followed principles of IE, my weight settled. I neither gained nor lost weight but I was happy. I had a much better relationship with food and my bingeing had completely stopped for a full year and a half. But I’m so lost because eating low carb and gluten free seemed to help with my some of my Hashimotos symptoms and I have such bad health anxiety that I’m terrified eating “wrong” will make my thyroid/gut worse.

I’ve been in the intuitive eating sphere for about 5 years now but I’m still really struggling to regularly incorporate mindful/enjoyable movement and exercise.

So, I originally discovered IE in 2017 and gave it a try in 2018. It was a final piece in my eating disorder recovery (which began in 2015.) I have probably read every book and resource related to IE, HAES and the non-diet mentality. However, this last fall I began struggling with more life stressors than usual and relapsed in some of my behaviors.

I have been reflecting on it lately and realizing how much it is interfering with my ability to function and do things on my to-do list. I'm not getting anything done right now. I do see a therapist and have a dietitian on retainer (I can't afford to see her until later in January.) I've decided to begin taking steps back into my recovery mindset by using my prescribed meal plan as a minimum and hopefully eating more intuitively again in time.

I've been doing a lot of bargaining with the disordered side of my brain to get to this point. I was hoping my friends in this sub could offer me any kind of encouragement or reminders of the joys of IE. So much of my ED thoughts have been reinforced by the outside world, especially as the end of the year approaches, and I'm taking any support I can get. Please share with me your favorite parts of IE and what it has done for you if you can!

My best friend recently told me that her 7 year old son “loves all things healthy,” “won’t eat fried food,” chose a side salad with balsamic dressing for his bunless burger (he’s always removed bread from his sandwiches, seems like an actual preference than something learned), and has come home from health class at school telling his family how they all have to “be careful of sugar, fat, salt…eat in moderation.” What 7 year old should be focusing on the macros of his food??? I know this isn’t coming from my friend or her husband because neither of them have ever really been diet-minded or health-obsessed themselves. So I’m pretty sure they think this attitude and information is all relatively harmless. But as someone who has a 25+ year history with disordered eating that I’m trying to rewrite through IE, I’m genuinely concerned that this information is being taught to 7 year olds. Health class at that age should be “eat fruits and vegetables, drink water, and be active!” The end!!

Do I have the right to step in and express my concerns to my best friend? I should mention we’ve been lifelong BFFs and I’m her sons’ godmother (she has twins but only one is expressing these opinions, the other could care less about his diet at this age). Not sure if that helps.

Somehow, the conversation shifted and a female family friend of my boyfriend’s was brought up, let’s call her Diana. For clarity, Diana was brought up for a reason totally unrelated to her appearance. My boyfriend has known her since they were infants so she’s like a sister to him. Out of nowhere, Eddie says “you know, Diana has lost a ton of weight recently. Like a LOT of weight. Looks great.” My boyfriend and I were dead silent. I didn’t say anything, I just found a sushi on my plate to stare at while the moment passed. My boyfriend said something to the effect of “oh? Okay” and Eddie kind of doubled down: “yeah, like a LOT of weight.” We didn’t respond. It was SO awkward. Eddie went to the bathroom a bit later and I turned to my bf and was like “wtf was that??” He agreed that it was so weird and awkward. Truly effective conversation ender. 

I couldn’t believe just how awkward it was to make a conversation about someone’s body, to make it a topic of casual discussion over dinner. Earlier in my life, before IE, it’s possible this is a topic I would have indulged in, due to my own insecurities and internalized fat phobia. But holy cow!! What a disgusting thing to flippantly bring up. I’ve been thinking about it for days and just had to rant about it. 

Something I’ve loved about IE and the community I’ve surrounded myself in is that how important it is to remove the emphasis from your appearance and others’. You also have to consider WHY someone’s appearance may have changed; there are many possible reasons why someone’s body may have shrunk and some of them are not positive. 

TL;DR: don’t talk about other peoples bodies. It’s f*cking tacky.",1640263978.0
Tis the Season to pick commercial-free media to avoid triggers.,35,rmxwho,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rmxwho/tis_the_season_to_pick_commercialfree_media_to/,6,"December is coming to a close, which means we're about to enter that week-long push where every television commercial is about New Years Resolutions.

I've got a few books lined up to read, some shows lined up to watch from Netflix, and some movies saved to my HD. My adblockers are updated if I want to watch youtube, and I'm only going to watch people who don't do sponsors.

If you're normally a cable TV person, or your streaming service of choice has ads, I'd recommend diverting from that routine for a week or two. We're all about to be bombarded with really shitty commercials.

Good luck everyone! Ignore the New Years BS.

Reactions to explaining intuitive eating to others,23,rm43nt,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rm43nt/reactions_to_explaining_intuitive_eating_to_others/,21,"Hi, I just wanted to share a struggle I am going through at the moment. I have discovered intuitive eating a few years ago but I am yet to practice it ""properly"", in the sense that I still am very much obsessing over food and still find it difficult to accept my body.

I have read books and listened to podcasts, and I will soon start meeting a nutritionist who is an expert in this field. I am excited to learn more and finally be able to practice food neutrality and just get rid of the diet culture that has permeated my whole life.

So you could say that I 100% believe in intuitive eating and how it can improve my life, I just am not there yet. I feel like there is a part of me who is still attached to the old beliefs, and for this reason, whenever I find myself talking about intuitive eating with someone else who doesn't believe in it or who asks challenging questions, I struggle to explain myself. More importantly, I get really frustrated at them almost as if they want to try and ruin this for me. For example, I was talking to a friend about how liberating it must be to ditch all diet rules and just eat whatever our bodies want, and she just took it as me saying ""go crazy on the cookies"" or something, and proceeded to tell me how you still have to control yourself around certain types of food or else you will put on weight. I know I should be understanding of her and all those people that think like that because it just shows they are still deep in diet culture, but all it does to me is annoy me and make me doubt myself. Also I hate that I feel stupid like I am doing something wrong and that somehow I need other people's approval to be sure my choices are the right ones.

Do you have any advice on how to deal with these kind of situations?

Thanks and sorry for the rant!

The new picture doesn't look anything like her! And people are commenting that this is proof that diets (or at least the one she was on) work.

I haven't done that for a couple of years now (yay!) and I'm quite happy with my choice.  In 2021 one of my goals was to really truly break up with the scale and calorie counting apps (I started IE in 2019 and had stopped using scales and diet apps regularly, but would still weigh myself ""occasionally"" or have a relapse and download an app, then delete after a few meals or days) and I really think I've finally done it (which feels AWESOME, BTW, and I think has really helped me to tune into my body's needs further, definitely recommend).

Questions About The 'Honeymoon Phase',8,rk095c,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rk095c/questions_about_the_honeymoon_phase/,7,"So, yesterday I decided to give myself unlimited permission to eat as many 'pleasure foods' as I wanted. Long story short, I binged on them to the point of feeling very sick and overly full.

For context, I've tried intuitive eating before but gave up because I got overwhelmed because I tried to do too many things at once (I was trying to implement gentle nutrition and listen to my fullness cues without having healed my relationship with food).  

However, even though I have unlimited permission to eat all of these foods now and I understand that eating a large amount of them doesn't feel good, I still crave them in large amounts. 

How long does this period usually last? Also, should I try to feel my fullness and eat until satisfaction during this phase and wait until afterwards? I'm scared that I'm going to gain weight, even though I could do so healthily as I am underweight. Should I continue to eat healthy meals along with these binges or should I avoid this so that I don't overeat? Is it against intuitive eating to knowingly eat past fullness if I am not satisfied and want more food? 

I'm worried that trying to eat until satisfaction too soon will lead to restriction. Furthermore, the first time I tried intuitive eating and even now I really struggle to read my fullness cues since I feel full after only a few bites, then feel hungry again about 10 minutes later so I don't know when to stop eating.

I've tried eating mindfully and stopping when I'm satisfied but the pleasure food never stops tasting good and I constantly want more.

So, in conclusion, when should I start listening to my body without feeling like I'm restricting?

My experience working with a HAES/IE dietician,36,rgehgx,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rgehgx/my_experience_working_with_a_haesie_dietician/,13,"**TW: Gentle nutrition chat. If you're not at a phase where you feel like you've healed your relationship with food to the point where gentle nutrition can be a neutral concept, feel free to click out of this post.**

I've been doing IE for over a year now. I dealt with a big amount of weight gain, and backslid a few times into diet thoughts (and sometimes action).

I decided that while I had mostly cleared out a lot of the nonsense around ""good"" foods and ""bad"" foods, I needed more guidance on how to start from scratch when it comes to eating well while still honoring hunger cues and cravings.

I searched for, and found, a certified dietician who specifically focuses on HAES and IE. She was absolutely lovely, really supportive of working with someone with a disordered eating background, and got in touch immediately to set up a meeting.

The big takeaways from our first session was to simply start by building meals that have one each of the following macros in any amount:

Fat, fiber, carbs, protein, and some kind of liquid.

She didn't give me sample suggestions, since I have a long history of macro tracking, but said to keep a journal and lightly keep track of my responses to certain things. 

So far, it's gone pretty well. I've had days where I didn't stick to the guideline and felt not-so-great. I've had days where I stuck pretty close and felt fantastic. Mostly what's been good has just been going, ""Ah I still need a fiber source -- let me throw some spinach or an orange in here.""

It's been nice because if I really want pasta, for instance, I can have that, but I need to be mindful that other foods are represented.

The single biggest realization is that I'm often not eating enough at meals, which then leads to snacking and grazing throughout the day. The point here isn't weight loss or body recomp, but rather convenience. If I'm going to go through the process of making myself a full, complete meal, it's nice to eat enough so that I'm genuinely not hungry a couple of hours later. 

It's also interesting how much my hunger can change from one day to the next even if I eat exactly the same foods. One bowl of oatmeal might have been enough yesterday but not enough today, etc.

The other big takeaway is that tracking is still a huge urge for me, but often my body will give me cues if it feels like it's been having too much of any particular food group. 

Long story short: once you're at a point with your IE journey where you can incorporate gentle nutrition, I think it can be helpful to work alongside a dietician just to make sure that your diet choices are working for you and that you're really listening to yourself.

I also went right after lunch to avoid sugar on an empty stomach. And it worked! my exam starts in a couple minutes and I'm sippin my lil drink and feeling way more clear-headed and ready for this.

Infant weaning leading me to panic that I will fail my daughter,26,rfuh41,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rfuh41/infant_weaning_leading_me_to_panic_that_i_will/,27,"I have a 6 month old daughter who is close to starting solids and this shift away from exclusive breastfeeding is creating a lot of difficult emotions for me. I feel so overwhelmed and feel like I need to change so many things to properly parent her. Long background below…I’d love any advice or thoughts from this community! I guess what I’m really looking for is a sense of hope, or any advice on how I can start to shift my mindset, or baby steps to try. 

Up to now, I could do the right thing for her simply by breastfeeding. Now, I have to teach her how to eat and I’m terrified that I won’t be a good role model. I’ve “dabbled” in intuitive eating with a lot of false starts (I’ve read many of Geneen Roth’s books but haven’t yet read any of the other books listed in the resources) and while I think I grasp the logic of it, it hasn’t shifted “my heart” and my behaviors are not aligned with IE practices. I eat past fullness, regularly. My husband and I eat dinner in front of the tv most nights. I eat a lot more when lonely or stressed. I crave sweets. The postpartum period has been challenging and I honestly feel worse than ever about myself right now. Food has become one of the few ways I feel “cared for” when so much of my energy now goes toward another person and yet I see that I’m not eating in a manner to actually appreciate the food. 

I’m terrified I’m going to fail my daughter. It feels like what I want to model for her is SO far from my current state. I’m physically larger than feels good; I’m not eating mindfully most days. I want her to experience joy in food, honor her body’s cues, eat without shame, and enjoy her body. Looking back at my childhood I often felt fat and shamed and I wholeheartedly don’t want that for her, and am afraid I will fail her. How can I teach her to enjoy and eventually prepare nutritious food when I feel like I’m not good at this myself? I feel like I need to basically do a 180 on how I eat in like…2 weeks!",1639441619.0

I didn't have the focus to work on mindfulness and hunger cues etc etc, so I've mainly just worked on removing the critical, diety voice, enjoying a variety of foods without restriction, and most importantly embracing body positivity and body neutrality, and addressing all my internalised fatphobia.

I really didn't think I was making any real progress with my eating. Even almost a year in I was having mini binges and being distracted with thoughts of food throughout the day, but recently I've started noticing some real shifts.

Today I was playing board games with some friends and they brought out those delicious vegetable crisps (chips). Initially I was shovelling them in my face, and I assumed I would be distracted by them until the bowl was empty. Instead, at some point I got distracted _by the game_ and entirely forgot the crisps were there. It wasn't until I got home that it suddenly hit me that I'd just completely _forgotten about crisps_. 

I'm honestly shook. I never thought this day would come. 

I've realised that the harder you _try_, the harder you make it on yourself. With the crisps today, I told myself I could eat the whole bowl if I wanted, that it was totally fine and allowed and not a bad thing, and in the end I didn't want to. It was awesome.

The hardest thing is being ok with ""junk"" food being just food. I understand why labeling food as bad causes guilt and cravings. But also the feeling like I'm harming my body because I'm eating sugar is tough to let go of. I was one of those people who got really into whole foods and clean eating and all of that. 

Now I understand I was blunting my normal endocrine cues and internalizing social stigma.

But this week we had family and I was enjoying Christmas cookies and cocoa, brunch, and all of that stuff. I kept reminding myself that it's ok, and to pay attention to the feelings I was having like pleasure or hunger or fullness. I ignored the food talk as much as I could. 

It's hard to learn to trust my body after so many years of reading labels and portioning and praising myself for discipline!!  It was good but weird, I felt like I was really doing something ""wrong"" by eating cookies. 

But also I didn't feel tempted to eat more than I needed, noticed when I was full, etc!!! This was great such a huge thing because normally I would be fighting the urge to pack it all in! I enjoyed the food so much. And I'm not worried about sugar addiction or anything silly like that.

Advice - Family Crossing Boundaries,2,rf3yl5,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rf3yl5/advice_family_crossing_boundaries/,4,"Trigger: mention of clothing sizes, weight gain, weight loss, binge eating

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry in advance if this is rant-y, I just need to get this frustration off my chest!

I'm also in need of some advice on how to respond to diet/body talk.  For context, I've been doing IE for almost 2 years, and for the most part it feels like second nature.  I went from someone who binged and over-exercised nearly every day, to someone who rarely thinks about food and feeds myself in a very calm and non-judgemental way.  All of that is great and I finally can focus on things that matter to me.  

The issue is other people in my life, specifically family members.  I gained weight since I started IE, going from a straight size to borderline straight/plus size.  I've lost some weight in the past few months but I'm still heavier than where I started.  And to be perfectly honest, I'm okay with my weight with how it is!  I've done a lot of work to accept my body and dismantle the fat-phobia I had.  However, the way I'm treated by my family at the two sizes is extremely different.  Family members would NEVER comment on my body before and I would always be encouraged to eat whatever I like.  Now, apparently they feel entitled to comment on my body size, the food I eat, the amount of exercise I do.  Literally, last time I saw my grandma she said to me ""You're getting wider, have you tried eating less and exercising more?""  I was so stunned by this, like who thinks it's ok to say this to a person??  Everyone seems to have an opinion they just have to share with me.  I don't know why they think they have the right to do this??  

My immediate/extended family all share the same opinion: that thinner is better and that if you aren't thin, you need to at least be pursing thinness.  I wish at least one person in my family shared my opinion and then I could have an ally in all of this, but there isn't anyone.  I live with a grandparent temporarily and when I came home with groceries today, the comment was: ""you should swap some of that bread for vegetables, bread causes weigh gain"".  I said something like, ""I get to decide what I eat"" and that was the end of the conversation.  

So my question is, how do I respond to these comments?  I've tried, ""there's nothing wrong with having a larger body"" (they don't agree) or ""my food is my business"" but honestly, I get pretty emotional when people make these comments to me and I find it hard to respond.  I'm terrible at confrontation!  I've been struggling so much with this for the last two years, I've been thinking about reaching out to a therapist who could help me deal, but I can't really afford it at the moment.

I love my family in every other way, but this obsession with being thin is so toxic.  I have family Christmas next weekend, and I really just want to enjoy a nice time catching up with everyone, but I know that the diet talk is coming.  I've laid down boundaries with certain people, but they still will speak generally about dieting/weight loss/etc.  I don't want to live my life hiding from people who are caught up in diet culture because that's a lot of people I'd lose from my life!  Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I really want to learn how to effectively deal with this and have a nice, peaceful relationship with everyone.",1639359935.0
[POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING] Tips for combatting binge eating?,4,rez8mu,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rez8mu/potential_trigger_warning_tips_for_combatting/,13,"Hi everyone!

I've recently started seeing a dietitian for binge eating/emotional eating and she introduced me to intuitive eating. Im new to this sub, and intuitive eating in general, so Im not 100% sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but does anyone have recommendations for things to do when I feel a binge coming on or when i feel the compulsive need to snack? to clarify, I am not restricting my diet at all, I only binge in addition to eating normally throughout the day, typically when I'm stressed and doing homework or something. I mainly am looking for tips for redirecting the behavior when I know I am not hungry and that I feel full. If this is the wrong sub for this please let me know, and please let me know if you know of a different subreddit that may be helpful with my question!! Thanks!!

edit:

So I realized that I should clarify a few things:

I have ADHD and I am medicated, and I strongly believe that my binging is dopamine related. I tend to binge at night, once my medication has worn off. I do not restrict during the day and my medication has not ever had an affect on my appetite, so I don't believe that is the problem. Even if I don't engage in a full on binge, if I ever study or work at night I literally cannot do it unless I am actively eating or snacking. It helps me to focus and relieve stress when my medication is not working. I want to redirect the behavior because I hate always going to bed feeling uncomfortably full, but I know I still need to find a way to access that dopamine in order to continue functioning.

This is my first week since I committed to learn intuitive eating and let go of macro / calorie tracking for good.

Hard, but already so freeing. :)

One thing I am struggling with is knowing how much to honour my fullness cues?

I get full quickly eating my main meals (eating 3/4 of my typical dinner serve before feeling full + then stop eating). But then I get hungry again 20-30 minutes later.

Should I keep eating past fullness? Should I adjust WHAT I am eating perhaps? Is it just a matter of allowing myself to get used to my bodies hunger/fullness cues?

I’m fine to go back and get more food / eat the leftovers later on. If I’m hungry - I now eat!! But it’s a little inconvenient especially work day lunches and dinner before bed.

Coming from a macro tracking background I’m quite good at “balancing my plate” and including a protein, carbohydrate and healthy fats etc.  I still do this but am listening to what my body wants, rather than pre-calculating my meal based on numbers.

Any ideas? Suggestions?

Your body isn't a steam engine, it doesn't burn the food you put into it. It breaks it down for various different purposes using various different chemical processes. Yes, some food goes into giving you energy, but some also goes to healing wounds or growing your fingernails or hair. Some of it goes into fueling bodily functions like the menstrual cycle or the digestion process itself. Certain things require certain types of food, for instance the brain runs mostly on carbs and sugars. Not every excess calorie turns into fat, some of it is excreted as waste or is used to raise your body temperature (hence why you sometimes feel warm after a big meal). A fire burns anything you put into it and turns it directly into energy. Your body doesn't work like that. Different people digest different things in different ways. You don't need to count every calorie and use up the excess, your body is smart and will store what it needs. Listen to your body and not oversimplified calorie labels.",1639236968.0

I was a RELIGIOUS calorie counter, and also restricted my intake heavily for a good year and a bit.

I know essentially eat whenever I’m hungry, and I have what a fancy instead of always compromising or feeling I haven’t ‘earned’ a nice meal. I listen more to my body, and if I fancy a some cookies… I’ll have some. If I’d had dinner and I get hungry and hour or two later, I say ‘F@CK Y@U’ to my old rules of eating windows and safe foods… I go and have what I fancy and then I feel happy and focused.
 Eg, last night… I had dinner, but I’m active so I naturally was hungry after a few hours, so I went and had some left over curry with some pasta vegetable soup. I felt happy and content after and went to bed comfortable and ready for tomorrow, instead of clutching my belly in hunger.

I'm 52 years old and have stressed about my weight for FORTY YEARS.  Forty freaking years.  Like... wtf? Sure, there are reasons why it all started (I'm a childhood sexual abuse survivor) but still... FORTY FREAKING YEARS.  I've yo yo dieted all these years with the normal outcome.  Gain to lose to gain more to lose more on and on an on.  During quarantine I gained 20 pounds on top of the 20 I already needed to lose (in my head). I had had it.  I wanted to take off the weight and KEEP IT OFF ONCE AND FOR ALL.  So... I went on a diet.  Not only a diet!  But THE WORSE DIET I have EVER been on.  And THAT is saying something let me tell ya!  Of course, it was touted as a ""Healthy lifestyle"" and I should havebeen clued in as soon as I was told no fruit!  Only very limited vegetables while you buy all the plans (disgusting cant even get it down without choking) pre packaged ""fuelings"".  I do get why they called them ""fuelings"" instead of food because OMFG it was insane.  It sure as hell wasn't ""food""!  As I am incredibly stubborn, I managed to stay on this ( 800 calories a day) plan for a month.  Until I ended up in ER in horrific pain from my kidneys, which I already have issues with.  Sent to my kidney doctor for a follow up only to have him yelling at me.  A first.  He wanted to know if I wanted to lose weight or if I wanted functioning kidneys.  I said, ""both?"" After a bunch of back and forth he handed me some literature in intuitive eating and some nutrtionists in my area.    Once I started reading about intuitive eating, how diets dont work and in fact work against you, all the stuff I could get my hands as this was all new to me but made SO MUCH SENSE I decided GREAT!  Let's do this!  HOORAY FOR ME!  I am OFF the diet BS train!  *Big celebrations*

Here is the catch and where I am seeking a whole lot of help:  HOW DO I DO THIS?!?  I can't seem to stop checking in on what I weigh.  I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WEIGH!  Why?  Seriously.  I have though about this WHY and all I can come up with is vanity.  Because I don't want to gain.  I know everything says throw away the scale, allow all foods, eat until full, stop eating when full, I've read and read and read and yet, here I still am.  WHY can't I get this through to my brain?  And you know how that makes me feel?   Like another failure.  I can't even do THIS FREAKING THING RIGHT?!  

Adding on to this, I still find myself looking at calories, thinking about the amount I eat, trying to decide if I'm full or not (Like... shouldn't that be EASY?  Either you're full or not.  WTH?!)

I get it.  I really really do.  I accept and believe everything I have read about intuitive eating, mindful eating, BS diet culture, loving yourself, being kind to yourself, breaking free of all the rules and restiricitons,  etc etc.  I get it!!!!  It ALL makes PERFECT SENSE to me.

Intuitive eating beside a compulsive eater - possible?,24,rcpvhg,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/rcpvhg/intuitive_eating_beside_a_compulsive_eater/,11,"I’m looking for any info or articles or advice about how to eat intuitively when cohabiting with a compulsive eater? My husband is a locust and as I get into IE it’s really affecting me. I know it’s not about him, but it’s triggering some kind of a perceived food scarcity. I have access to food, but I have no idea what my cabinet will look like the next day. Half a loaf of bread will just disappear. I’ll buy good chocolates, eat one, the box will be gone later that evening. A giant lasagna for dinner, leftovers enough for our family of four to get another meal (like six slices) it’ll be gone between breakfast and lunch. 

Almost every meal I make either feels grossly gluttonous or else he comes to the table looking disappointed. If I eat slowly it’s gone because he eats at treble my speed, and I’m struggling at not responding by increasing my portion and pace (and not giving myself a chance to listen to my satiety cues). 


Adding to this, it’s all very triggering. I come from a super diet culture family. Being hot and skinny was everything. I have three brothers and a mom all with disordered eating (as in hospitalized or suffering serious medical issues directly resulting from it). Im trying really hard not to carry this energy forward with my own family.

These comments drove me to take the opportunity to weigh myself when I saw my doctor, something I’ve worked hard not to do. I wanted to know so badly how much weight I had lost and I felt so happy when I knew. I have an ED history and it felt just as good as it did when I was in the midst of it.

This might be a long post - basically, a few days ago I checked my weight and realized that I was actually at my lowest weight since starting IE. Unfortunately, this started a downward spiral of me compulsively checking my weight and eating less and less to see if it would go down. I think this has been coming for a few weeks now, ever since I realized that I don't like the way greasy or sugary foods make me feel; it's true to some extent, but I think I'm trying to convince myself that I never need to eat anything sweet or that a piece of tofu with some carrots will fill me up for dinner.

I should mention that I started going through the IE companion workbook when I first started my journey, and I'm planning on picking it up again after writing this post to re-acquaint myself with the ideals.

I have two questions: 

1. What should I do? Do I need a ""reset"" in terms of my IE journey, and if so how would I do that
2. Also, how do you all handle checking your weight? Like reading nutrition labels, I don't want to abandon it completely so that I have some way to gauge where I""m at, but doing it too much can badly affect me mentally. Thanks so much for all your help <3",1638854119.0

I met a dietician 3 years ago who I HOPED would set me on the path to permanent weight loss—but instead sent me on a journey of Intuitive Eating, body acceptance, and ultimately helped me overcome binge eating and restricting, weight cycling, and a host of other unsavoury issues I once struggled with.


I don’t regularly check my weight but after a traumatic birth and nearly dying postpartum 1 year ago I noticed my usual 20lb baby weight stayed on. And now my BMI is around 34.

In the next year or so I plan to have an abdominoplasty to correct the hanging skin and inverted cesarean scarring. It’s partially for aesthetic reasons, but on my 5”1 frame the overhanging belly puts pressure on my back and hips, and affects everything I do from physical activities to sleeping. 


Here’s the kicker: no one ever fully recovers from diet culture, it’s an ongoing struggle. You remind yourself to choose happiness and choose yourself whenever the thoughts creep in..

But most surgeons in my area require a bmi of 30 or less for surgery.

This year has been busy and stressful with moves and babies and covid.. and  I think if I eat more healthfully and mindfully and make some time for the exercise I’ve been craving, the weight should come off. Even without paying attention to the scale.

I've been working with a therapist and a nutritionist and its been going okay. I feel like giving myself permission to eat my former ""forbidden foods"" has led to a much healthier relationship with them and even led to me not wanting some of them at all anymore and that feels amazing. But I also know that even the smallest glimmer of wanting to lose weight or return to diet culture can be a quick was to sabotage the process. So here is my somewhat trigger-y question - what if I just want to lose weight for ME? I don't want to do a fad diet and I don't want to do it because society says I should (though maybe that is the root of this), but I just feel like my mental health would be better if I felt comfortable in my own skin.

I know I will eventually get to a place in IE where I'm consistently listening to my body and incorporating gentle nutrition, but I just can't get past the idea of wanting to lose weight because I know it will make me more comfortable. Since August, I've had a number of aches and pains in my back and shoulders and have just felt like crap, really.

I have been on the IE journey for a couple of months now. I have been navigating this process with a  psychologist and a nutritionist.  It was my 30th birthday gift to myself as I struggled with an eating disorder for a long time. Now I'm trying to re-integrate the sport in my life as I had completely stopped when I start this journey. As for me, sports have been associated with weight loss, the therapist thought it might be beneficial to stop completely in order for me to understand that I actually don't like running on a treadmill 30 minutes every day which ends up being correct.

However, now I'm starting to miss it and I want to start again but I feel that is it so tightly connected to weight loss in my mind that I am scared to fall back into my old habit again.

Recently it has been hard for me to intuitively eat - I have many days where I eat meals that make me uncomfortable or unsatisfied and have trouble doing other tasks during the day because of this, or because of food preoccupation and my negative body image thoughts creep in more often.

I decided to put an end to this unmindful, very diet mentality reminiscent, unhelpful period behind. I know IE is not linear, but I want to do something about this. SO... after reading about it in a different book about a completely different situation, I'd like to try something of a... intuitive eating game?

What I want to do is, somehow assign my more mindful eating habits tokens. It doesn't have anything to do with how much or what I eat, just a meal without distractions and one where I feel nice and ""cozy"" afterwards (like after a Thanksgiving dinner or a warm oatmeal breakfast). Eating that makes me feel good! Meals where I don't care about judgmental looks, or when I buying clothes for my new size, for example. I want to assign these helpful behaviors tokens, and once I reach a certain number of them, I get to go to an independent bookseller nearby to buy books! I love that place because it carries a lot of stuff you can't find anywhere else but it's kind of expensive. So I'd like to at least tie it with a positive change.

I am just worried this can grow into some dieting type behavior? Like when people reward their restrictions with cheat days and stuff. I really don't want that! But I'd like to make this change fun, and I don't know how to!

So please advise! What do you think? What could I do? What could I reward or... just any help would be appreciated!

I didn’t realize how much self-hate and food categorizing I built up over the years.  Now that I’ve given myself permission to eat with no restriction and no judgement, and to eat mindfully, I find myself at peace with my food for the first time in a long time.

However, I’m struggling to do the same physically.  I am aware that when I exercise, I feel better.  I feel more clarity mentally, I have extra energy, and I sleep better.  But even knowing this, I can’t quite will my body to exercise or to do it regularly.  

The treadmill gets difficult and boring, walking feels monotonous, even with a good podcast, workout classes are too challenging, HIIT and jump roping are difficult to do for long periods of time, I can’t really convince myself to do at-home workouts regularly, team sports become inconvenient to attend (even if I pay membership dues), etc. … I’m having a hard time finding a workout for me that I enjoy and can incorporate into my daily life.

I know that after I finish exercising, I feel good and strong.  But the actual exercising part just feels so boring or difficult to me.  I haven’t found the exercise for me, despite trying lots of options.  How did you find the right exercise for you?  

And, what I’m most curious about, how do you know it’s the right exercise?  I assume it’s like intuitive eating, where you give yourself permission to do what you want, and if you wanted to do a certain exercise (or not), that’s what you do.

Even the ones I do now, I need to trick myself by listening to a podcast or watching a show to get through it, and it’s not enjoyable.

Struggling with being bored with food + other queries,11,r0zs4o,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/r0zs4o/struggling_with_being_bored_with_food_other/,6,"So I was going through my mind of what do I want to eat for breakfast this morning and realised - I'm kind of bored with food. Nothing really interests me (that I have in the dorms anyways) like oats, toast, leftovers from last night, etc. I think of any food I could try and nothing appears in my cravings or head. It's really really weird. Maybe it's because I'm not hungry at the moment? But even then when I do get hungry, I just don't really want to eat because nothing interests me. I made a Walnut Loaf Cake on Sunday and haven't tried any of it because it doesn't interest me. 

I feel like I'm going mad, but maybe it's just either 1) my very high blood sugars I'm working with my GP to lower, 2) I've given myself exposure therapy to all the foods and let my body know it can have anything whenever it wants, or just something else? To be fair, I'm also about 3 weeks on a higher dosage of Sertraline (antidepressants) so maybe that's it, but surely that side effect would have worn off? Or maybe it's just depression/tiredness and not being able to think right? I really don't know.

It's not just that - I generally just don't feel like doing anything because nothing activates the pleasure sensors in my brain, but that's something I want to try to work on (force myself to do things like play a game I used to love or do some coding for a set amount of time.) Maybe that's got something to do with it?

Oh, and another thing. When I do eat things like takeout, I've noticed I'll always buy more than I feel I can manage, because I want to try so many different things - things I've been restricted on a lot in life (burgers, cheesy chips, onion rings, etc.) Then I find I can't stop myself from eating a lot of it, and feel awful physically and mentally. Or I'll eat some and put the rest in the fridge for the following day, but feel awful as it puts me to sleep and I sleep terribly, so my mind will associate eating said food with feeling horrible, yet I still love ordering it again. 

My relationship with food is still so effed up, but my counselling sessions are helping me understand the roots of all the disordered eating and such. Lately (the past few weeks/months) when I eat anything bigger than a ""snack"", I go from hungry to very full quickly as all the energy in my body is directed to digesting the food, so I feel fatigued and sleepy. It happens whenever I have a main meal like oats and a coffee in the morning, or a sandwich at lunch. I'm not really sure why this happens, but I'm guessing it's to do with my messed up relationship with food and my poor poor digestive system.",1637740152.0

My biggest hurdle is the body image stuff which I'm sure is everyone's biggest hurdle!
I guess I'm after people's experiences with weight gain. Yes, I know that's not supposed to matter with IE and it's most likely unavoidable but it terrifies me.
I'm a 5'1 female and according to the online calcs - which I know are only a guide, I only need approx 1800 to maintain my weight - and that's with me being pretty active and working out. Usually to lose weight I need 1200-1500. I do find I gain pretty fast going over these numbers and find I have to be pretty careful to maintain. 
So if I truly ate what I wanted until satisfaction and didn't worry about numbers, at a guess I'd be probably eating lime 2500-3000 cals a day. So how would I just not continue to gain and gain and not stop?? That's the part that scares me. 
Can this happen? Does this happen?
And if everywhere tells me I only need 1800 cals to maintain then why doesn't my body feel like that's enough a lot of the time (mind you I'm not overally small as it is - I am still technically ""overweight"")

Is this the place for me?,9,r0spxd,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/r0spxd/is_this_the_place_for_me/,8,"Note: I just downloaded the IE audiobook, read the 10 principles, but that is as far as I have gotten so far. 

I feel a bit different in my situation. I have been lean my entire life. I don't weigh myself unless I'm at the doctor's (it's the only place with a scale)--not even when I was pregnant or thereafter. I was the rare pup who craved strawberries, carrots, and broccoli (and my child now requests the same, just like I did). Sure, I ate the occasional doughnut, had the occasional ice cream, ate chips, etc. But it wasn't stuff that I desired--I have always been the kind of person who could have a pint sitting in the freezer for months, likely forgotten until someone pointed out it was there. I never dieted in my youth or in my young adult life. I've never been a fan of fast food--the smell always bothered me. I've been a pescatarian (eggs and cheese are my exceptions) for 2+ years. 

But then I couldn't seem to get pregnant. A doctor suggested I added more 'good fats' and possibly try something like paleo. I read the books and got on board. That turned into whole 30 and then keto. So from 32-42, I've been on this restrictive eating journey. None of it has ever felt hard though bc I was *basically* already eating this way unknowing that it was a thing, and all I had to do with incorporate a few tweaks here and there. I lost a little bit of COVID weight on keto, but more noticeably I look and FEEL stronger. 

Speaking of stronger, I have always been a pretty active person by nature. Even when I didn't do a lick of exercise or team sports as a kid or young adult, I still swam and walked often bc I loved it. I found running and cycling and (light-med) weights and yoga didn't look back. I love the energy I feel from it. Now, as a mom, it's basically my coffee in the morning and my alone time. This is not up for debate: I love and need to sweat daily.

That is all to say: I find keto to be a bit much (boring if you will). I'm not hardcore. I don't count things or take bloodwork or pee on stuff. I just don't eat the carb-heavy foods. But I can tell I need something different in my life. Something that feels a bit more normal to me, like how I was pre-making a baby. It would be nice to eat oatmeal, mango, and apples again! I used to love homemade burritos! And the occasional banana bread!

And yet, suddenly for the first time in my life I feel very threatened by the thought that if I ditch this 10-year thing that I'm a bit stuck in that I'll immediately gain 10 lbs and have to buy a new wardrobe and I'm already feeling self-conscious bc more wrinkles are popping up, my neck is all-too-telling, and and and. And well, why am I so scared of this? And so, here I am.

\---

The thing is I found ya'll and my friend is on this journey, but I'm not seeing people like me on here. Surely I can't be the only one who just discovered restrictive eating at a later age, who is considered lean, and don't find dieting to be hard or have a yo-yo effect, but just want to return to a more normal state of mind.

So is this the right place for me? Will I feel alienated for not yo-yo dieting or discovering restricted eating later in life? Will I get side eye for being a fit person looking for guidance?

I hope this finds those who are like me so I can dig deeper and understand what it will take to get where I think I want to go.

Ever since I let go of this guilt and learned to have a healthy relationship with food, I also came to realize that god I love peanuts. I have peanut butter breads occasionally, and I eat them with peanut butter then I make my own natural peanut butter with garlic peanuts (it has a surprisingly nice complex flavor) and eat it with fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, etc., then I also eat peanuts by the handful as a snack, I top things with peanuts, I put peanuts in my veggies, sometimes I make peanut sauces. 

I finish a 1kg bag of peanuts per 1-2 weeks completely by myself, which I like to think of as a testament to how far I’ve come. I finally have a healthy relationship with food, one that makes both me and my body happy, and nothing exhibits that better than just how many peanuts I eat.",1637639512.0

I'm finding it hard to keep a good reading on my hunger cues because I drink lots of water throughout the day, usually a gallon. I know this is partially leftover diet mentality because in the past, I would try to fill up with water instead of food. However, now I'm struggling to decipher if I'm hungry, thirsty, or neither. Or I'll drink so much that I feel full past times when I usually eat, and I'm not sure if that's because of the water or I'm actually full from eating sustaining foods.

I've read the Intuitive Eating workbook, and was introduced to it by my nutritionist, but as my appointments are spread out, I thought I'd reach out here.

I can’t really figure out my hunger cues and I’ve been over eating. Guilt and shame and fear have all been creeping in. And I think I finally figured out why I’m having these issues! I started a new job in June and that’s when all this began. The hours and break times have completely thrown off my normal eating patterns and I’ve been over eating because I’m afraid to get ravenously hungry during my shift. At my new job I have to take my break only 30 minutes after clocking in. My shift is from 3:30 to 11pm. So from 4 until I get home around 11:30 I can’t eat. Which means no dinner. So I’ve been eating much earlier then I like, when I’m not even hungry, so I could fit in another meal before I head to work and then eat another meal not long after when I have my break at work. And I tend to over eat at the break meal because of fear of getting hungry during my shift and not being able to eat. I do bring snacks but they are not satisfying enough. I’ve also realized I need to sit down and pay attention to my food in order for me to feel satisfied. My old eating pattern was breakfast around 11:30, snack sometime between 1st and 2nd meal, dinner around 6:30/7, and then a small snack before bed.  Now I eat breakfast at 9, lunch at 1:30, 2nd lunch at 4, snacks, dinner at 11:30/midnight. 
 Now I’ve got to devise a plan to get back to recognizing my hunger cues and not over eating out of fear or being hungry later.  Part of me wants to share my eating disorder history and recovery with my boss and to ask if I could have my break at 6:30/7 when I would actually eat.",1637513908.0

I don't restrict anymore but I still feel like I'm always just waiting for a big depressive episode/binge to be around the corner.

IE is still very far from my current state but i’m trying to implement some of the main concepts such as honoring hunger and cravings. 

So for example today i had breakfast much later than usual (12pm) but after only one hour I already felt hungry. I waited a while and then I made myself a snack: I was craving an apple but I was still feeling hungry afterwards, so I got a yogurt with chocolate chips, but i was still craving some muesli (which I used to eat during binges when I had nothing else to binge on). I let myself eat a normal (measured intuitively) size without bingeing on it because I keep telling myself that only allowing myself to eat what I want I will recover from BED. 

Now my question is: how do I recognize cravings from “attempts” to binge? and plus, did anyone felt this extreme/mental hunger in recovery? I know it’s quite common but whenever i feel this sensation I can’t help thinking I have a problem and that there is somehow something wrong with me.

They are so mean about my body and now I’m a size bigger than I was last year. It seems like a protective thing to try and discover my faults or squeeze into smaller pants in anticipation of criticism. 

Everyone says boundaries, boundaries, boundaries. But boundaries only really work if you have people who respect them. Ive had more conversations about boundaries with my parents than I can even count. I’ve had to just reduce the amount of time I see my parents to only a few weeks a year. Given that this year I’m a bit more fragile with newly trying IE, I’m only seeing them for 1 week. 

I’m just terrified. I don’t want them to say something that I take to heart and ruins my IE progress. If anyone else said anything I’d be like fuck off I love IE. But parents just have a way of cutting you right where it hurts.

Not to mention, if I glance over at sugar or some other metric, it could change how I interact with that food, and that doesn’t feel great. 

I feel like I’m “cheating” on IE (oh the irony) by wanting to track food at all, but I also lift pretty heavy and just want to make sure I’m fueling my body properly.

Intuitive eating for 1.5 years and still gaining weight,18,qxyepe,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qxyepe/intuitive_eating_for_15_years_and_still_gaining/,9,"Trigger warning: EDs and weight numbers. (Also sorry- long post)

Hi all,

I'm posting here today to ask for some advice and if others have experienced what I have.

Today I had particularly bad body image day. I'm not much of a clothes shopper, but my workplace doesn't allow leggings. They're ok with jeans now and I recently bought super flexible jeans but they're still a bit tight to sit in all day. So I went to the clothing store and tried on a size larger than I used to be before the pandemic. Pants were still too tight. Sized up another, and they fit, but I started to feel horrible about myself. I have an apple body shape where my legs are thin looking compared to the rest of my body, and I gain a lot of weight on my top half, especially my stomach. So seeing how big my stomach was compared to everything else, just didn't help me feel any better about myself. My legs are probably one size higher than my pre-pandemic weight, but my stomach is 2-3 sizes higher. Which leads me to my story:

I have struggled with binge eating and restricting since middle school. It wasn't until the beginning of the pandemic that I finally said I needed help to get over this. That was at 24 years old. Now I just turned 26.

I'm East Asian and my family has always been thin (though I'm fairly sure my Dad has orthorexic tendencies and my mom has anorexic tendencies which both fed into me and my sister's binge eating issues, so I'm unsure how their good their metabolic health truly is.) I have also always been relatively thin (and now I look back and think I was bonkers for believing I wasn't in the past). I'm 5'2"" and my weight in college was always between 107 and 115. My weight in high school was around 100. Which is fairly common for East Asians. I've also always loved running, irrespective of whether it helped me lose weight. I just love the feeling of being free when I run and living in the moment.

I started seriously distance running after college. I've done several half marathons and a full marathon. By the end of my full marathon (fall 2019), I looked as thin as I did in high school - weighing in at 104 pounds and a 00 jegging size. I never noticed over time how much my clothing size was dropping (from a 4 in college to those 00's) until I realized my jeans kept falling and I had to keep sizing down. I was really happy with my body - but still struggling with the ED and obsessive/controlling mindset about making sure I ""never missed a training run."" Again, I love running regardless of any mental health issues, but it did sort of weave itself into my issues.

When the pandemic hit in early 2020, I stopped running - partly because of the pandemic but partly because of IT band issues and runner's knee issues. The pandemic, one could say, forced me to re-evaluate my volume of training, and whether my ""no pain no gain"" controlling mentality was health (it is NOT, I realized). I stopped working out and commuting (which also stopped me from gaining some extra steps from commuting). I was mostly just went on walks, and the occasional home workout video. And at this time, my binge eating and restricting was at its worst. It felt like rock bottom mentally, with my relationship with food.

I decided I could no longer tolerate this. I needed help. I discovered intuitive eating and started therapy. Despite people saying intuitive eating could result in permanent weight gain (i.e. my set weight would just permanently be higher forever), I took the chance because I felt I had nothing else to lose mentally. After 4 months, my eating was mostly intuitive. I was amazed at the newfound food freedom I had.

When I went to the doctor for my annual checkup in winter 2020, I weighed in at 109. 5 pounds higher than my marathon weight. I wasn't elated, but I wasn't upset either. This wasn't per se, much different from my college weight. Completely worth it because I had total food freedom! Food no longer controlled me!

Fast forward to 6 months later when I got vaxxed and started going back to the gym (where there's a scale), I weighed in at about 115. I started to feel a bit worried. At this point my eating is pretty intuitive. I don't really overthink my eating at all. I just said to myself ""focus on healthy habits and work on everything stronger. Whatever is supposed to happen with my body and health will fall in line.""

Fast forward again to about a month or 2 ago, I weighed 120 when I went to the gyno. I had never weighed this much before. I know that I'm not overweight but this is just much higher than anything I'm used to. Since starting to go back to the gym, I lift weights 2x per week (want to increase my glute and hamstring strength to be able to safely go back to running again). In the summer, I also liked going bike riding. And now I'm running again 2x per week in addition to lifting (not very long though - just a couple miles at a time is all my knees can handle). I am proud of the progress I've made with my deadlifts and other workouts!

But, I have to be honest with myself and there are a lot of days (especially the past few months) where I don't honor my hunger signals immediately. I think I secretly hope undereating a bit will help me lose weight. BUT it's not mainly that. I have the opposite problem now as I used to - intuitive eating made me realize a lot of foods I used to love, I GENUINELY don't love anymore. I think partly because my parents only cooked Asian food when I grew up (so I never got accustomed to having a diverse range of food types and snacks and that has shaped my taste palette today & so many foods I used to love snacking on - chips, granola bars, etc- just feel too salty or too sweet for me now). Sometimes I can't figure out what to eat even when I really do want to eat, and I'm tired of my own cooking, despite how many recipes I've tried in the past. I love foods from Asian bakeries (rice porridge, rice noodles, etc. - not the sweet stuff or buns because I don't really like bread - I'm more of a rice/noodle gal) but there's only so much of that I can buy before it becomes too frequent and costly, or my stomach just hurts from eating out too much.

Not sure of importance, and I plan to see a GI doc about it, but I think I have malabsorption of food issues - I have to go to the restroom for #2 multiple times a day to the point where even if I eat a big meal, I feel like it goes right through me, and I feel hungry an hour later. Maybe my foods just aren't that balanced? Who knows at this point.

My question is, has anybody been in the spot where even after a year or 2 of IE, their weight hasn't stabilized? I do love and appreciate my body, and I'm WAY happier than I was 2 years ago and would NEVER wish to have an eating disorder again. I will take the weight gain any day over an eating disorder. I'm scared to change up my foods and try to ""eat healthier"" (I don't think I eat super badly by any means, but it's not always healthy) because I'm TERRIFIED of obsessing over clean foods again. But I can't help but occasionally feel bad about my body and clothes, and wonder if my weight will just keep going up every time I see the doctor every six months? Sometimes I want to buy a scale just to see how much my weight changes month to month, but that also terrifies me and I know there's a huge risk as well of obsessing the number as well.",1637384942.0

I'm really tempted to just do a nice traybake of roast veg tonight with some homemade potato wedges and serve with some breaded chicken steaks.

Anyways, it's just super duper weird. Like, a year or so ago if I could get everything in the biscuits aisle, I would in a heartbeat. But now, the excitement for things I've wanted to try for ages just isn't there, because my body has learned that this food will be available to me whenever it wants. And maybe it's realised that the donuts it's been craving and been restricted of my whole life, aren't as appealing as it thought, and it doesn't feel good when I have them.

My dad is a portion control fiend who makes a lot of moralistic comments and family meals were always a minefield before I moved out.

Help understanding IE,26,qqwlod,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qqwlod/help_understanding_ie/,23,"Hello. I just finished reading Intuitive Eating 4th edition. I'm hoping people can help clarify things for me. This is new to me so I hope I labeled the post accurately. Please forgive any missteps in the language I use, I mean no offense.

1.  The authors seem to rely heavily on failings of diets and diet culture in their examples. I've never really been on any formal or informal diet plan. It makes it hard to relate to the information in the book. Is intuitive eating only (or best) for those that have experience with lots of diets?

2. I have a very hard time understanding how working to have a smaller body is being unkind to your body. Size and weight are only one measurement of health, totally agree. People are naturally different shapes and sizes and that's fine, totally agree. But, at a certain level one's body size can be detrimental to one's overall health. It seems obvious to me that part of being kind to myself and my body would be taking care of it, to help it be stronger and function more comfortably. Is it wrong to think like this?

3. I also have a hard time understanding the authors when they say there are no ""good foods"" and ""bad foods"" as mentioned in the book. This is objectively false. I guess the best example is foods containing trans fats, which are linked to heart disease in even very small amounts. How do you navigate around this? Is avoiding those foods still restriction?

Really Struggling To Read My Hunger Cues,6,qr0cfo,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qr0cfo/really_struggling_to_read_my_hunger_cues/,8,"Hi I'm sorry for posting again about hunger cues but I'm still really struggling to make sense of them.

When I wake up I usually feel hungry (although the feeling isn't usually very strong whenever I do feel hungry) so I eat breakfast and can usually accurately stop eating when I'm full (the same applies for my morning snack and lunch). However, when it gets to dinnertime (this is decided for me, I don't get to choose when in the evening I eat) I feel no hunger whatsoever and cannot tell when I'm full while eating, meaning I usually have to guess but most of the time I still end up eating past fullness. 

It's so frustrating because I feel like I can't fully enjoy my dinner when I'm constantly stressing over figuring out whether I'm still hungry or full, because again, I get no hunger cues. 

I'm sure I'm not eating enough for the day in just my breakfast, snack and lunch (and even what I assume is enough at dinner) because I'm eating less than I did even when I was restricting. My dinner isn't even too close or too far away from my lunch (about 4 hours) 

I don't know what to do because I want to listen to my body and give it as much as it needs but I'm just not receiving the hunger cues I need to do so. Eating more earlier in the day also isn't an option because I don't have enough time. I also seem to get full really quickly when eating meals in general, even before I feel like I've had 'enough'.

Does anyone have any advice or reasons why I might not be feeling hunger cues around this time? Should I force myself to eat more even if I'm not hungry to give my body enough food? I've already ruled out drinking too much water and eating too close to mealtime so I can't think of anything else. I do take a multivitamin everyday, though I'm not sure if this is relevant or would affect anything.

Help with Shopping with Kids,2,qr3y0s,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qr3y0s/help_with_shopping_with_kids/,6,"Hello everyone! This is essentially my first post to Reddit at large, though I have lurked for years on various threads. I just feel a sense of urgency to start eating intuitively so that I can pass it on to my kids. My daughter is 10 and my son is 13.

Recently I've come to realize that I have been struggling with some disordered eating and I want to quit. I've been listening to the intuitive eating book, so I decided to take my kids grocery shopping so they could choose the foods they wanted to eat. It quickly became apparent that they would choose to take the whole store home if we could fit it in the car.

On the fly I decided to limit their choices to one or two sugary foods/bakery items, one kind of cracker, etc. Is this the right way to go about this? My daughter was in the bakery and seriously wanted to take home one personal sized chocolate cake, one huge Barbie birthday cake and a brownie/cookie cake (full size). The kids are with me every other week, this amount of food would last 3 months, even if I didn't attempt to regulate how much of it she ate.

The other issue. My son has ADHD and Asperger's and sometimes has difficulty focusing and now that he's a teen, he also willfully does not pay attention sometimes. Ha ha. He was unfocused and daydreaming at the store, I kept trying to call his attention to the fact that we were shopping for foods that HE wanted, not me. He eventually bought in and started picking stuff out, but he refused to choose any kind of cracker. His sister picked Cheez-Its, which the boy promptly ate all of in the last 12 hours.

Should I divide all foods into two for the kiddos so this doesn't happen? Should I go to the store and replace this before they come home and his sister realizes her cracker snack is gone? Should I take them to the store after school to prove, physically, that I will replace food for them once it is gone?

I'm at a loss here. Any choice feels restrictive or, in the case of going to the store, like I am setting myself up for a lot of extra work in this food arena in the future. I'm willing to do it if it's the best way to set them up with good eating habits (which I had absolutely no modeling of as a child), but I am a single mom with 2 jobs, y'all know how it is.

How do I seize the moment ?",37,qpfaa7,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qpfaa7/my_fat_middle_aged_chronically_dieting_mom_is/,18,"background: Grew up with a insecure, dieting mom and a foster sister with a restrictive ED. As a result I developed my own disordered eating and have been in recovery for \~3 years. My mom doesn't know any of the details and I've been advised by other family members to avoid discussion about my disordered eating experiences and recovery in order to avoid conflict. 

&#x200B;

I visited my mom this weekend and she mentioned that she went to the doctor and was told that she's totally healthy. I told her I was happy for her and said that's cause for celebration. But she said she was confused and shocked how she could be healthy despite being ""hella overweight"", her words. I told her that fat people who live healthy lifestyles can be healthy *and* fat, and shared that my bloodwork I had done at my last physical came back perfect despite being what is medically considered overweight. But her confusion seemed to persist, citing that I exercise more and eat ""better"" than she does so my health makes sense but hers doesn't. She said that she can't believe she's not pre-diabetic. She maintains she needs to diet to lose weight in order to be ""actually"" healthy... like her perfect cholesterol, blood pressure, etc doesn't make her healthy. 

 I do wanna add that the last time we talked about my weight, maybe a year ago now, she pointed out that I had lost weight (I am by no means thin, but have ""evened out"" or found a semi-set point since my refeeding phase) and I told her I didn't want to talk about my weight, as I obsess about it and it's bad for my mental health. She said ""that's the best way to do it"", and pro-actively talked about how none of my issues with food had anything to do with her. She's lost and gained about 50lbs since then, always beeming with pride when she's thiner or bloviating about her diet failures when she's fatter. 

These things lead me to believe I can help my mom find some kind of freedom from diet culture and anti-fatness in her life but I'm not sure how to go about it. Any advice here?",1636383229.0

Food and spirituality: Cooking is Changing EVERYTHING for me,37,qnf5b9,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qnf5b9/food_and_spirituality_cooking_is_changing/,7,"So for background, I used to cook all the time. I'm from a family that cooks and we rarely ate out when I was a kid. But I moved to Asia a few years ago where it was super cheap to eat out - anything from street food to fancy restaurants - and super fast and cheap have food delivered. And the delivery was my achilles heel. 

I fell out of the habit of cooking, and coming back to the West, it took me a while to get back into the groove. I found myself binge eating pretty regularly and I wasn't feeling good, physically or emotionally. But I really can't afford to be ordering UberEats or buying junk food here, and I had to start cooking again out of necessity. And I have fallen back in love with it. I've found it to be reallllly helpful for my intuitive eating journey and my recovery from binge eating. 

This time around, i'm not restricting what I eat, which gives me SOOO much more latitude in the kitchen. Whereas before I'd pigeonhole myself to keto-friendly/low-carb meals, now I just cook whatever the hell I want. And I eat VERY WELL for a fraction of the cost of eating restaurant food - roasted apples and shallots with sausages; veggie, goat cheese, and aioli wraps; butternut squash and roasted garlic pasta; lentils and carrots in coriander and olive oil. I MEAN COME ON! And then I'm left with all kinds of leftovers and I can get experimental. Bananas too ripe? Banana bread! Radishes drying out? Crunch factor in a breakfast taco! Herbs wilting? Homemade salad dressing! 

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that food is spiritual. It nourishes us, it connects us to the earth and the seasons, it binds us to our families and cultures. But I think in modern societies, we've been conditioned to see food as fuel. That is so wrong, and it's not discussed enough when we talk about diet culture. Diminishing food to its caloric content is actually such a perversion of its true value in our lives. Food should be joyful! 

When we love and find joy in things, it's unlikely that we'll ever frame that thing as an adversary. Like, if you never learn how to maintain a car and only ever drive around the suburbs, a car is a pain in the ass thing to maintain. But imagine learning all about how cars work and getting your hands dirty to take care of it so you can drive around national parks and car camp on weekends. Totally different approach to the same thing, right? 

When we cook, it's a whole other world of joy and indulgence - we take each constituent part and make something greater than the sum of those parts. We put effort into it, which makes us appreciate its place in our lives more. We are forced to delay gratification which is healthy because it prevents mindless eating. We fine tune our palates to the seasons which helps us live in the moment and connect with the natural world. We learn new things and skills, which is an inherently important part of being a fully-formed human. 

Since I've gotten back into the kitchen, I've started approaching meals differently - what do I *want* to make? What do I *want* to eat? How can I use my leftovers in new and interesting ways? What should I keep on hand to ensure that I'm eating a balanced diet and addressing my true wants and needs, and what can I leave out? 

No matter what your history with food is, or which part of the eating disorder spectrum you've struggled with, keeping good, whole, nutritious, and enjoyable food in your kitchen and making time in your life to cook is absolutely something you should try on your journey to healing your relationship with food. When you love it, it will no longer be your adversary.",1636130549.0

I don't think I really understood it or thought too much about it until I found this sub a week or two ago. With that being said, I guess I haven't really practiced it yet? I tried, but I ended up developing binge eating disorder (unofficially--it was never diagnosed) about 2 years ago. I think that had a lot to do with the way I recovered from my first ED. Now that I moved back out of my hometown last month, I have finally been able to let go of the binge eating/overeating. Yet I still don't know how to listen to my body despite all this.

&#x200B;

I don't know a lot about IE. I have not read the book yet but have the workbook on my Christmas list for this year (LOL I just moved and pretty much am out of any extra money). I only just discovered there was a book last week actually. So yes, I am pretty new to this, even though I technically have known about it for a couple years now. I saw a dietician for my outpatient recovery starting in mid 2018. Then I moved for college in late 2019 and found another one in my college town, where I continued to see her for about a year until I moved back to my hometown. I have not seen one since because I really didn't have great experiences with either. 

&#x200B;

Because I ignored my hunger cues for so many years (starting by denying hunger cues and then eventually denying fullness cues), I pretty much don't have them anymore. Maybe like once a day I'll feel a little hungry. So I essentially have to force myself to eat 3 meals a day and maybe a snack. The only thing I can feel that is probably related to hunger cues is lightheadedness sometimes. With my current situation, I am terrified to eat too much and feel full (thanks BED). But I don't want to shrink my stomach again to where I eat like nothing everyday. I'm afraid of both extremes because I've been on both sides of the spectrum for most of my life. Now that I'm kind of out of both, I feel very lost and confused. How do I know how much to eat when my body doesn't seem to indicate it to me at all?",1636047916.0

I’ve been doing what I thought was intuitive eating for years now, ever since I tried to really recover from bulimia, which I am still struggling with. 

I’ve only just realized that although I no longer restrict myself of the types of food I eat, and the reason I successfully did this was because I realized that actually the types of food I was eating didn’t necessarily change my body weight so long as I kept the quantities in check, one of my main triggers to binge with all-or-nothing mentality is now my hunger/fullness signals. 

Once I pass the point of what I deem to be an acceptable amount of fullness, I will binge and purge. I also get anxious if I am asked to eat if I’m not hungry, to the point where someone will ask me why I’m not eating at a certain mealtime and gently push me to eat at least something  And I respond “you can’t make me eat if I’m not hungry!” I try to wait until a time that I feel personally or acceptably hungry to finally eat, and then I’m excited to actually eat.

I think diets in the past often sort of brainwashed me into thinking a lot of food was no good even though it’s perfectly healthy. Allowing myself junk food has actually made me want it a lot less but I still enjoy it occasionally. But I certainly don’t force myself to do anything. I think I’ve finally got this thing down.

Peer-reviewed research on weighing oneself?,29,ql9crc,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/ql9crc/peerreviewed_research_on_weighing_oneself/,51,"I got into a rather heated discussion with my spouse about weighing oneself and whether or not it's a negative behavior.  For me, it totally is.  Doesn't matter if I have a ""good"" or a ""bad"" number, if I weigh myself, I will get anxious and binge.  If I don't weigh myself, I might overeat sometimes, but not in the same way at all.  From my perspective, since weight isn't a particularly strong indicator of health, I should stop weighing myself forever, focus on eating and moving in a way that feels good, and get actual health markers like cholesterol. BP, hA1c, etc. checked once a year or so (fortunately, knowing my cholesterol level doesn't seem to trigger the same binge eating, and of course it's a PITA to get your cholesterol checked so...even if it is triggering you aren't going to do it that often).

My husband's take is that I'm treating the symptom rather than the disease...that my ultimate goal should be able to step on a scale and not have it impact my eating.  He also seems to think that my response to the scale is relatively unusual and that ""most"" people are capable of a neutral response to the scale. While I think this is a great goal in theory, it sounds like a fuck-ton of work to put in just for...what? To be able to collect a data point that is not actually a good reflection of my health, when there are other, non-triggering, BETTER metrics available (e.g. cholesterol levels)?  I also think my response is not that abnormal, but maybe I just spend too much of my time hanging around Intuitive Eating conversation and have a skewed perception.

So.....are there any peer-reviewed studies that examine whether or not regularly weighing oneself is actually a healthy or unhealthy behavior?  Particularly, if it's generally unhealthy or just unhealthy for a relatively small proportion of people?

Psych told me to buy scales,27,qkqc7q,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qkqc7q/psych_told_me_to_buy_scales/,21,"T/W: weight, weight gain and weighing, BMI

Hello :) 

So I have only sort of recently started to get into intuitive eating after years of dieting and fasting. I found a lot of stuff around around intuitive eating on instagram and started listening to the food psych podcast, and I've found it all really hopeful and helpful. Yet to get the intuitive eating book but it is on the list!

I told my psychologist that my relationship with food and my body is finally something I was ready to work on and was really excited when she said she was absolutely happy to work on this with me. She told me to buy the book Overcoming Binge Eating by Christopher Fairburn, and we will use that approach.

After a couple of weeks of keeping a food diary (which was going really well as I had already been trying to use intuitive eating principles of allowing me to eat and fuel my body) she told me to get a scale and weigh myself at least once a week. I haven't weighed myself for months and the prospect of weighing myself after gaining weight terrified me. She also made a comment along the lines of ""We will keep an eye on your weight and if if gets into the overweight BMI territory we we look at what you're eating and maybe make a few changes"".

After weighing myself, I realised I am on the cusp of healthy/overweight as I am woefully short and as I mentioned I have put a fair bit of weight on. I know that the BMI is a ridiculous way to measure health but I feel seeing it had a negative impact on me regardless. I think I would have managed to deal with seeing my weight better had I not have heard that comment and thought that now there was something for my psychologist to 'fix'. 

Has anyone gone through this program before? Is there a way to combine this with the tenets of IE? I am really enjoying IE and have started to heal my relationship with food and realised that if eating regular meals and exercising in a way that doesn't feel like punishment lands me in this body, it is meant to be my body but gosh darn it is hard work!

I have had other negative experiences with that gyno since then and have confidently concluded that she wasn't the right doctor for me. I always got the feeling that she was kind of fatphobic so I'm happy to no longer be seeing her.

I'm getting insurance coverage through work next month and I am very invested in finding a great gyno and finally pursuing treatment for PCOS. However, I'm terrified that a doctor will just flippantly tell me to 1) lose weight or 2) go on a diet that cuts certain food groups out (a friend told me they eat a low carb, low sugar diet). After a year of IE, I feel relatively comfortable with what I eat and managing my gentle nutrition, and I'm terrified of having to make a change like that and how it'll affect me. I'm certainly open to trying anything, I'm just nervous about it.

How have you dealt with a PCOS diagnosis while intuitively eating? 

Also curious to hear from anyone who has been put on medication for PCOS, as I am most interested in this route (progestin-only BC was quite awful for me PMS-wise but did wonders for weight management, so I wonder if it was actually working for me?)

New colleagues have got me triggered - and thinking about the way i view myself,23,qk95wc,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qk95wc/new_colleagues_have_got_me_triggered_and_thinking/,10,"Hey guys, In this post i'm mentioning things like (small) body size and triggering comments - proceed at your own risk! :)

I've been in recovery from anorexia for a year now, and I have been doing so well - no food thoughts, no desire to lose weight, eating when hungry and stopping when full etc.. I've been having food freedom, or so it feels. I've read the book

Anyhow, fast forward to, say, 4 months ago, when I started working in a restaurant. Amazing place, really fun colleagues (Amaaazing food, haha!) etc. One thing though - I'm by far the smallest person there. I'm 17 years old, almost 18, and the rest is all 25+. I'm 5'7"" but my colleagues are all taller than me. I never would have noticed or made a point out of these facts if my coworkers wouldn't have (as I haven't been busying myself with the way my body looks and, truthfully, I think I still have a warped view on my body, perceiving it as larger than it truly is)

At work I'm referred to as ""the little one"", yesterday my colleague put his hands around my waist and remarked ""Oh my god, my hands can nearly touch eachother!"" Comments from last week include ""I bet you can shop from the children's section still, you're so tiny!"" Or ""ofcourse we fit through this (very small passage in the kitchen), you'll fit just about anywhere!""

It's like they specifically read through proana Tumblr Imagines before my shift starts. (""Imagine them lifting you up easily and commenting how little you weigh"", bleergh) 

I don't want to make a point out of my history with ED's and I don't think I should tell off my coworkers for it as I feel I'm stable enough in my recovery to not be all that affected by it. However, of course THAT tiny part of my brain is still very flattered. 
I'd really love some tips on how I can put these kinds of comments into perspective so as not to let them get to me, anything's appreciated.",1635753456.0

Halloween Candy Win,39,qjwsb5,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qjwsb5/halloween_candy_win/,5,"I've been doing intuitive eating for about a year. I struggled with accepting every aspect of it in the beginning, and I still have work to do, but I feel more free around food than I ever have. I don't binge anymore. I can keep foods in my house that I used to have to ban for fear that I'd eat it all in one sitting and make myself sick. I still occasionally go overboard, but I have a habit now of checking in with myself and asking, ""Does this feel good to my body?"" which helps reduce binging. 

I've been feeling a lot of pride for myself lately because there's a huge Costco size bag of Halloween candy in my house and I haven't binged! I'm not afraid of the candy, or worried that I can't trust myself. I've eaten a few pieces each night after dinner and felt zero guilt. I've learned that, now that I'm not binging, I don't have to worry about sudden massive weight gain, and my weight has leveled out and been consistent for about six months. I eat what my body wants, when it wants. When I'm too full or sugared up, I stop. 

I just wanted to make this post for anyone who is feeling lost or struggling right now. I've been conscious of my weight, and actively tried to be smaller, since I was a child. It's been a slow process, un-learning diet culture. I look back and realize that every article or post I read, every journal entry I wrote, every conversation I had with loved ones, had a cumulative effect. It all helped, even if at the time it felt like I was throwing pebbles at a giant. Eventually, those pebbles become a landslide, and the giant that is diet culture can be defeated. 

I think I half-thought I'd never be free of the desire to be thin. It's still there, but the voice is smaller, and I understand that, all along, it just wanted me to be safe. But, I tell myself that I can be safe in a larger body, and the benefits of feeling happy and free and at peace with myself far outweigh the potential benefits of being thin. I'm not going to war with myself ever again.",1635708459.0

Yet when I do core exercises specifically I don’t enjoy them (hence why I don’t have a strong core to begin with 🙄), and it takes me back to my unhealthy exercise days.

However, I can't stop feeling like what I'm doing now (lots of walking, rollerblading, some dancing) isn't enough and that I should be doing some different types of exercise, specifically strength training and higher intensity cardio. It doesn't help that everywhere I look I see other women with high intensity workout routines that I know I don't enjoy and feel morally inferior to them. I feel like I'm being too lazy and that in order to be healthy I have to exercise more.

I feel this compulsion to do more exercise specifically out of fear that my current levels of activity are will cause me to be unhealthy or are just morally not up to the standards of others'. 

I see other intuitive eaters who have stereotypical gym workouts as part of their joyful movement and I wish I could enjoy it as much as them to the point where I can do higher intensity workouts without feeling like I'm forcing myself to do them. This, however, feels impossible because i just don't like this kind of movement.

Coworker suggested a specific diet after concussion,28,qi175e,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qi175e/coworker_suggested_a_specific_diet_after/,16,"I have a coworker who I truly adore. She is someone that makes going to work more enjoyable, and I’ve learned a lot from her over the past few years. We’re quite close and even though we live in different states, we know a lot about each others’ personal lives. I got a concussion on Monday (slipped and fell while cleaning the shower, so of course never cleaning the shower again) and my team knows what happened. They’ve been very supportive of me taking time off to heal, etc. 

I got an email today from said coworker. Subject line: “unsolicited advice”. It started with “Hi, I’m sorry if this violates boundaries, and please feel free to not respond to this”. She said shes concerned about my recovery and felt compelled to share this after watching a family member NOT recover after getting a concussion. 

She then just said a sentence or 2 about “any version of a diet that puts you into ketosis can help” and linked an article. 

I don’t know how to respond. She clearly knows (perhaps from previous feedback from others? Unsure, making assumptions) that this had the potential to overstep boundaries. I want to gently call attention without being confrontational, and without being like “wtf mind your business”. 

I was sort of thinking about saying something like “Thanks. I’ve actually struggled with disordered eating in the past and this would likely cause more harm than good.” And I want to add something like “I greatly appreciate your concern for my health, but there’s a lot about people’s lives you may not know about so it can sometimes be best to keep suggestions to yourself”. But I don’t think that sounds super nice. I don’t know. I’m torn. I could also just not respond and she’d probably get the message. 

Any advice welcome.


UPDATE: I ended up writing back using suggestions from u/cleverusername531. My coworker responded saying she appreciated my trust in sharing that with her, acknowledged unsolicited advice is a bad idea, and acknowledged the “silent epidemic” of disordered eating. She also said she will resume minding her own business and that she knows I’ll find the best path to health for myself.

Often I'll go without eating for several hours and not feel physically hungry whatsoever but feel like I haven't had enough food, have low energy, feel lightheaded and be constantly thinking about food. Are these hunger cues and valid reasons to eat. I've noticed that if I go without eating for a while I'll stop getting stomach-related hunger cues until I force myself to eat something, which is really disconcerting because I don't want to undereat but I feel like I shouldn't be eating if I'm not 'truly' hungry.
In a nutshell, I often don't feel hungry until I start eating or never actually feel hungry at all but still get other hunger-related feelings like thinking about food.

If I feel physical hunger and I ignore it for more than ten minutes because I'm busy/the next mealtime is too soon to have a snack without not wanting that meal, I stop feeling hungry. This means that when it comes to my 'time to eat', I don't feel hungry and worry that if I force myself to eat I'm not listening to my body and eating when I don't need it. If I've felt hunger previously but it has since disappeared, should I still eat?

Finally, I keep waking up in the middle of the night feeling hungry or going to bed hungry but I don't feel hungry enough during the day to eat enough to prevent this feeling. How can I be sure I'm getting enough food? Should I eat more even if it feels like too much?

Because I've been financially struggling, I've not been able to afford meat as much, and if I got a craving, I wouldn't know what I'm craving so I'd eat way more of stuff like biscuits, nuts, etc. Which would make me feel awful and overly full but not satisfied.

Back story:  I have had a binge eating disorder for 30 years.  I've tried therapy, nothing has really worked.  I have a very disordered view of food and eating and I ping pong back and forth between restriction and bingeing.

I had been reading about IE and decided to try it.  It just clicked.  For six weeks, I felt like I was living the dream (i.e. what normal people experience):  take-it-or-leave-it attitude toward former restricted foods, amazing body positivity attitude, an adeptness at listening to body signals.  I felt like I had finally 'cracked the code' and found success.  

I took a trip and was able to maintain IE with no real problems, but once I got home again, my ability to IE was just...gone.  I journaled, I listened to podcasts, I read and re-read the book, I put up 'cheat sheets' of the 10 tenets around the house.  But I slid right back into bingeing and self-criticism.  It's been 2 months now and sometimes I think back to that glorious period of IE with wonder.  ""Remember when I could just live my life without the baggage and guilt?""  I have tried SO MANY DIETS in my life that once a plan doesn't work, I feel ""numb"" toward it, unable to internalize the plan, unable to work it again, on to the next thing.  My mind feels so exhausted with decades of the all-consuming contemplation of FOOD FOOD FOOD that I can't seem to objectively assess it now.  

But I desperately want to be able to learn IE, really learn it. I know that this is the only thing that will work for me, and I want that freedom and self-acceptance. But it feels like I have a total mental block.  I'd love to go to an IE-supporting therapist, but there's only a couple in my small town and the waiting list is months and months long.  

When I've tried to return to IE, the problem has been that when I try to assess food to see if I want it, if I'm hungry, etc., I can't seem to answer those questions.  I just feel a numbness.  It's like the answer is trying to swim up to my brain, but can't seem to make it through.  If I can't properly assess how I feel because I'm so exhausted with thinking about food in general, how can I be successful with IE?

Extreme Hunger?,20,qewm8y,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/qewm8y/extreme_hunger/,23,"Hello Reddit… I need help.

 I am slightly underweight, and I know this. I tracked (and still do track) my calories and from November of 2020 through to around March of 2021 I was eating very restrictively (only around 1200//1300 calories - for a 5ft 10, 19 year old man), then around June of 2021 I decided to increase slowly. Now I am eating 2200 calories a day, but I am never satiated. I am never full. I could easily… EASILY devour the contents of my fridge. I see people go out to eat and leave some (let’s say they get a pizza and can’t finish the whole thing… or a curry and say “I’m stuffed”) and I look at their food and wonder… how? I could easily clean my plate and then there’s. But I don’t.

 I don’t indulge in cake and sweets often. But I’m at breaking point. I always feel hungry, always a growl in my tummy. I even eat a huge dinner… bags and bags of veggies and a whole bag of potatoes, chicken and noodles too with bags of cauliflower rice, but then guaranteed 20 minutes later, I could go again. What is this? What’s wrong with me? I feel like if I do say ‘f@ck it’ and just eat what I feel like, when I feel like… my weight will obviously sky rocket. I could honestly eat multiple, whole chickens… an entire loaf of bread, cans and cans of beans, bowl after bowl of oatmeal, and I wouldn’t be full… or not for long anyway.

 What’s happening to me? I am now 57.8Kg, and I’m seriously considering upping my calories to 2500, but weight gain (or should I say ‘fat gain’ scares me). I want to eat more. Any advice? Any experience?

I moved into college for my first year in august, about two months after beginning to work on my IE journey. 
At home it was great. I was enjoying eating a variety of food, learning to cook new meals, and going to the gym to feel strong and healthy. After moving out, my entire left has been flipped. 
I used to be a binge eater and I was always an extremely eater as well. As it turns out, I really do not like college. My classes are more stressful than I anticipated, the area my campus is in is unsafe and anxiety inducing, and despite my efforts to make friends the students are not receptive or kind. There is nothing to do besides homework on the weekends. Additionally, I have celiac disease, so my only food options are burgers, pasta, and french fries most of the time.
I have been snacking non stop every day. Knowing my options are so limited means when I have real food to eat, I keep overdoing it. The gym is overcrowded and I have no time to get there. I am constantly tired and bloated. I have been seriously contemplating going back to my diet from before I started IE because of how little control I have over my body now.
Does anyone have any advice on how I can feel a little more in control in my situation? I've talked to campus nutritionists and had no luck.

Her response was amazing and helped me get back into a better head space!! Some of the things she said:

Bounceback culture is not reality

Do not do anything restrictive that may be triggering to you (her example was that using MyFitnessPal is a trigger for her) 

Diets don’t work 

Be patient with yourself and nourish yourself, because motherhood is hard

I need some help. I realized that I am eating out of feeling lonely when my husband works night shifts for several days in a row. When it’s only one or two nights he works, I don’t feel too lonely and I have hobbies that keep me occupied. I’ll have 6 hours to fill my time those nights, from 5 to 11 pm. Sometimes I take walks after work or go visit my mom for a little while. That helps because then I’m not in my sad, empty little apartment. 
 
But when it’s 3-4 nights in a row, I find myself not feeling as interested in all my hobbies and wanting to eat just to feel soothed. I don’t even love what I’m eating, it’s more of the mouth sensation when I’m eating and crunching that is soothing to me. I end up feeling sick to my stomach the next morning. It’s snack foods like cookies and chips. 
 
Do you have any tips to help curb this? I see a counselor and we’ve been talking about it. It’s decreased overall but this week I was also on my period so my hunger was off the charts. I think more protein could have helped. But there’s still the emotional eating component. I ordered some teas I love to sip on when I feel that way too.",1634816073.0

Hi everyone,

I hope this is allowed here.

I’ve been reading a lot about intuitive eating for a few weeks now and after talking to my therapist, yesterday I did a full day of eating intuitively. For me, this meant throwing out all my “rules” around food and as a result I ate breakfast at work for the first time, well, ever, and ate lunch an hour earlier than I usually do. Then, around midnight for some reason I was starving in bed so I got up and ate a snack—also something I would never have allowed myself in the past!

I have a history with EDs, however, and I just read a post on r/fatlogic about intuitive eating that seriously scared me. The person said that in 6 months of IE, they gained 22lbs. 

I feel myself backing out of this journey and could really just use some extra encouragement.

However, after trying everything I realise that the flavour and overall satisfaction I get from them is really disappointing. I'm not sure if it's because my tastes have changed or because I'm now eating it mindfully and viewing it neutrally or what.

I just feel so nostalgic about and miss the times before I used to diet and restrict, when I used to enjoy these foods and found genuine satisfaction from them.

Is this something I can learn to enjoy again? If not, does anyone have any advice on how to accept the reality that I don't enjoy sweets as much as I expected?

Disconnected from hunger/fullness cues + a few extra questions,6,q72x3l,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/q72x3l/disconnected_from_hungerfullness_cues_a_few_extra/,4,"Hello!

I've been invested in IE for around 3 weeks now, maybe? I've known about it for quite a while now, and am learning lots about it via Just Eat It, anorexia recovery Youtubers, and dieticians such as Abbey Sharpe. (TW: mention of restriction) >!Prior to this, I had been restricting extremely heavily for just over a month.!<

I know this sub must get a lot of questions about hunger/fullness cues, and well, I'm not really any different, haha. 

I recently learned that not feeling hungry does not equal feeling full. So while my hunger can immediately dissipate within a few bites, I can eat a full meal and still feel like I'm in that neutral area of neither hungry nor full? Like, my feelings of fullness don't really increase as I eat, aside from those first few bites where that hunger goes away. And that's just when I actually feel hungry; I'm still reconnecting with those cues. 

Also, maybe an hour or two after eating, my stomach has this very subtle but very noticeable sensation. I don't know how to describe it. It feels similar to what I think physical hunger might be like, because it involves slight rumbling? Or movement? I don't know. It's something, but I don't know what. Digestion? My stomach just doing stomach-y things? Apologies for the lack of a better description, haha.

Finally, I understand that it's normal to be hyperfocused on all of this, especially at the start of the IE journey when I'm still figuring everything out. But me being hyperfocused seems to make me feel... frustrated/disappointed that I feel physically full? As if I'm waiting for what/when I'll eat next? This sounds a lot like mental hunger (and maybe it is), but it's not like I'm craving, or even really wanting, anything specific. It's like my brain is telling me, ""well if you eat, you'll stop hyperfixating on this for a little while, until your stomach starts doing that weird sensation thing again.""

If anyone could provide some insight on this, that would be great! Again, I apologize for the lack of better descriptors.",1634097133.0

Hi everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I guess this is a bit of a venting moment, but if any of you have advice or words of encouragement, they are greatly appreciated!!

Today, I was eating during a class of mine, as were the majority of my peers. Out of nowhere, my teacher targets me and tells everyone to stop eating. She told me that I had “had enough to eat,” “couldn’t eat all day,” and that “I shouldn’t be eating as much.” Granted, I do sit in the front of the class and she could have just been talking to everyone and looking at me by default, but generally, when you know, you know. 

My friends and I start laughing because we all generally think she’s insane (she’s said offensive shit for months), but then I start thinking about what happened. People I’m not very close with making comments about my physical appearance or eating habits is are huge triggers. Before my eating disorder truly attracted developing, I was bullied severely for YEARS  about my weight, height and choice in food. When you’re a chubby kid, you can’t even IMPLY that you’re enjoying your food, to avoid being called fat. 

A few hours later, I sent her an angry email telling her that what she said was completely inappropriate, especially given the fact that I’m still in eating disorder recovery. She has yet to respond.

I am a really stressed college student who's having trouble with her IE journey lately. These past two weeks, all my self care has turned to eating. I know I should not condone emotional eating, or food being a source of comfort, but I am struggling with this especially because I fear that I don't have any other self care mechanism I could activate. It is like whenever I feeling blah or empty or stressed or frustrated, I just reach for something to eat.

I have meditated on and off (and now, mostly daily) for the past year, I can't exercise every day but I do get a lot of movement from cycling everywhere and on weekends. I love to write and paint as hobbies but I can't seem to have any time for either - studying full time and working part time. I play music, but ""academically"", so rather than being relaxing, it is quite stressful. Not to mention studying abroad and with most of my friends and all my family left behind in a pretty turbulent country.

So I'd like to ask you - are there any self care habits you'd recommend? Other than eating? Especially things that I could do while eating :D I'd love to try them out.

Thanks and xoxo.

Big win - listening to my body. (TW),39,q3ewxk,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/q3ewxk/big_win_listening_to_my_body_tw/,4,"TW ED, weight mention, TMI/poop, rambling

So I’m in the process of recovery from an ED (weird combo of food addiction, orthorexia, and bulimia complicated by the fact that I’m autistic) and have been working on applying certain IE principles into my recovery. 

During my ED the slow transit constipation I’ve always dealt w (low muscle tone from being premie) turned into some kind of full blow IBS/gastroparesis/idk bc my dr won’t dx it based on my weight. As a result I experience near constant bloating (like full on distention hurts to breathe bloat, not like period bloat or thanksgiving meal bloat at all before anyone comes at me w/“bloating is normal!!”), slowed digestion, severe constipation, and occasionally the opposite. 

One food that I’ve been able to pinpoint as a trigger is green bell pepper. 

Unfortunately I love green pepper. Fits my nutritional goals, taste preferences, texture preferences (CRUNCH), and features heavily in a lot of my fave recipes and go-to meals. 

During the first eight months of recovery I was still INCREDIBLY food obsessed, still very into the food addiction side of bulimia even though I was technically in recovery and not engaging in binge/purge behaviors- food and eating was the most important thing for me. I looked forward to each meal religiously. (Part of this was that I was still v depressed and eating was like the only thing I could look forward to or enjoy - I’m still struggling w this tbh). 

As a result I kept eating meals with green pepper (and other trigger foods), because the idea of NOT eating the specific meals and recipes I wanted was devastating. My food addiction was still so bad that the joy of eating was at the time worth the awful discomfort that followed. 

Last Sunday I made one of my fave pasta dishes that included green pepper. And obviously I enjoyed it a ton! But after eating I was sitting there with my stomach so distended I though I might vomit, and thought - this isn’t worth it. 

The discomfort was not longer worth the pleasure of eating, and that’s such a HUGE thing for me in overcoming my ED. The world won’t end if I have to stop eating green peppers. There are modifications I can make in my cooking - sure it won’t be EXACTLY the same, but it’s not the end of the world to me anymore. I can make my spicy pasta dish differently (I use Morningstar chorizo, diced zucchini, tomatoes peppers, and onions, and omg it’s SO good), I can modify my taco bowls and fajitas (I’m seriously obsessed w spicy food lol). 

My body has been telling me to stop, and I’m finally listening and I’m so proud of myself. I want to be in a place where food is no longer the most important thing in my life and this is a huge step closer to that.",1633629989.0

I was extremely tired of obsessing over food and cutting off certain foods. Cutting off certain foods usually always led to binging and strong feelings of not trusting myself. I then made a huge change to my way of thinking by actually being kind to myself yet I would reflect on how a certain food made me feel after I would eat it.

It took months of analyzing how most different foods made me feel and shutting up that mean part of my mind that would chastise me for eating the ""wrong"" food. At night I would focus on how I enjoyed the food I ate that day rather than sulking in the feeling of having a ""bad"" day of eating. 

I learned that if I'm craving something I should just go ahead and satisfy it. After satisfying my craving I would reflect on how my body felt. This has naturally led me to actually avoid this foods I used to binge on because I don't look forward to energy crash that usually happens afterwards. I'm now naturally eating so healthily to where my body feels energized and happy, with no feelings of overly fullness and energy spikes and crashes. 

I actually love the way I look now and I am beyond grateful for my body and what it does for me. I'm also okay with throwing away food! I grew up food insecure so this was also a major development for me. 

Overall, I feel more at peace with my mind, I'm actually becoming my own best friend and not worst critic. Food no longer rules my life and it feels peaceful. If I start to get feelings of food ruling my life I'll take a step back, reflect and try to show kindness and understanding to myself.

I have been practicing intuitive eating for about 18 months, after a long battle with a binge and restrict cycle.

I’m struggling lately, because I work really long hours - usually 4 12 hour days a week - and I seem to hit roadblocks here. I bring a breakfast and lunch to work, and maybe a snack for later in the day, but then I find myself out of control after dinner, where I’m absolutely housing high calorie foods - peanut butter, ice cream, you get it. 

Oftentimes I’m doing this at work, ripping through the Oreos in the snack box, so on and so forth. 

Obviously, this feels bad, both physically from the volume of food consumed at once (and the fact that I’m eating a lot of low-nutrition food), and emotionally because my my ED history.

Trying to figure out the source of the pattern, I sat down and did some math and realized that with my breakfast, lunch and packed snack, I’m still eating probably only half of the calories I’m “supposed” to be eating before dinner (I’m a taller, physically active man). Even after dinner, I’m still lacking, which just fuels the cycle. 

I can confirm this is likely what’s going on, because I never behave like that on my days off.

It feels like without a meal plan for these days, or an idea of eating X amount of calories, I’m just going to continue the cycle. My meals are by nature high volume, so adding more nutritious snacks to make sure I’m eating enough seems like the only option.

If anyone knows any possibilities of what exactly could be causing this, let me know. Because aside from maybe eggs and bread, this has been the only giant craving I've had.

Just curious; I don't need to put an end to this.

Medication suppresses appetite--advice?,16,q14gkb,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/q14gkb/medication_suppresses_appetiteadvice/,9,"Unsurprisingly, if you google any combination of 'suppressed appetite' and 'help,' you get a front page which is 80% articles or adverts for suppressing your appetite. Which is the opposite of what I want.

I'm recently (2 months) started Elvanse (Vyvanse) for my ADHD, and it's giving me a bad case of the Reverse Munchies. It's the only thing that renders me functional, and unfortunately I don't have the money to try out a bunch of other meds until I find a stimulant with the same result which doesn't suppress my appetite. 

I feel a little nauseous thinking about food sometimes and my brain doesn't ever seem to arrive at 'it's lunchtime!' naturally when I'm on the medication. I have breakfast before taking it, but then I forget to eat or don't want to eat until five or six in the evening, which is really not ideal for me because my blood sugar gets very low and I get wobbly and weird. I'm also too hungry to cook when I do eat, so I don't get to eat the stuff I like! Usually, and in the evenings once it's worn off, I really enjoy cooking. (Also very annoying is the fact that eating later means sleeping later.)

My work is active and I'm a weightlifter, so my energy requirements are quite high, which makes it more difficult. I'm not worried about protein. Spoiler for weight talk: >!I'm also a pretty hefty person, which means that people have assumed I would be glad about this side effect. So far between doctor's visits my weight has only dropped by enough that can be explained by monthly fluctuations, but I know that I'm not eating enough. I don't want to check my weight often, which annoys my doctor, because I know I'm a person who likes numbers and graphs and goals and gets obsessive about them and it seems like a very bad route to go down, so I don't know how much it's changed recently. I was thinking that when I go back to in-person GP visits, the doctor can read if off the scale while I look away, and let me know if there are any concerning changes.!< 

I've never intentionally done intuitive eating, and I still haven't read the book yet, but I spoke about it a lot with my partner recently as they're trying to start ED recovery\*. I realised that it sounds a lot like the way that I ate before, and it's definitely the way that I want to eat. But the scrambling of hunger cues thanks to the meds is really messing with me at the moment. So I'm looking for ways to make sure that I'm getting enough food into me that are in line with that ethos. From talking to family about the problem I've got the impression that if I ask in the other subs I frequent I'm going to get lots of advice with a weird diet-culture-y slant to it.

\*It's not my main motivation, but I do also want to model good eating habits and good food philosophy for them. They've said that it's helpful when I'm around, because I remind them to eat when I'm eating and encourage them to have what they like, and I'd like that to continue. I don't think that following a meal plan or counting calories to make sure I'm getting enough is a good idea when I'm around them, even if the goal is eating well, not restricting. I think that getting my own eating habits healthy and well-managed is one of the best things that I can do for them right now. Cooking together was a really great date night for us when we met and I'd love to get back there.",1633350544.0
Learning the nuances of your own body and combatting other’s opinions— an essay,15,q0ra6p,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/q0ra6p/learning_the_nuances_of_your_own_body_and/,6,"I started recovering July of 2020. It’s baffling when I feel like I have to fight my mom when she’s trying to tell me I might need to “eat healthier” as if I wasn’t the health nut trying to convince her with all of my might to “eat healthy” like me back then, for all of those years, absolutely crazy. When I decided to heal myself from the inside out and it didn’t look great on the outside, then it became a problem all of the sudden. Then she “understood” the “health” nut stuff I was all about. It really hurts when she’s heard what I’ve gone through to get better, and cared about it at one point or pretended to. Then I realized I had fatty liver and bile reflux so bad when I went to the extreme of forcing myself to eat when I wasn’t hungry beyond when I needed to (many months into recovery). My body gave me signs and thankfully I knew what to do and I got through that easily. But ever since then, that I’ve learned the nuances of my body more, my mom assumes that I’m being lazy or not eating well enough, when I explain over and over my natural instinct is always to eat “healthier”, but when I go too overboard with that (while healing from long covid) it impairs my healing and energy not to be having calorie dense food that’s available, not always whole food buts processed. It’s crazy because in 40 years of her life she never took this stance until now. She always insisted on having processed food in the house and no one could tell her otherwise (her mom forced healthy food on her only). But now, that I’ve recovered, and told her in my mind I feel much better and can do a lot more, she doesn’t seem to care about that. Was she lying before? She’s also a narcissist so honestly I would appreciate in this situation people not rushing to her defense. In other situations it might be different but I over explain again and again beyond what I should ever be willing to do with dignity, and she continually asks assumptive questions pointing to the fact that she’s blaming my health on this. I followed Elisa Aas and Matt Stone’s material Throughout recovery and they’ve discussed Evelyn Tribole material, which I have listened to some of on YouTube as well",1633296657.0
Help needed: can’t afford to indulge my junk food cravings,5,q0wnwx,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/q0wnwx/help_needed_cant_afford_to_indulge_my_junk_food/,3,"Hi all! I’m new to this subreddit but I’ve been practicing IE for around a year. (I read E&E’s Intuitive Eating book a year ago when I first started and listened to a lot of Christy Harrison’s podcast episodes around then as well.) At first it worked really great; I listened to my body even when I was craving McDonald’s every day for weeks on end and eventually stopped craving it and even became mildly repulsed by it. Same thing happened with chips, cookies, and ice cream. 

But now for the past two months I’ve found myself really struggling. I’ve always had a soft spot for movie theater popcorn and found out about a year ago that I could get it delivered to my house. The first few months after finding that out were fine, I’d eat it here and there. But lately I’ve been eating it two to three times a week, or more. And the constant salt taste in my mouth seems to have somehow “reactivated” my taste for McDonald’s because I’ve started craving it again and LOVING the taste. So now I either order McDonald’s (on a food delivery app as well, so 💸💸💸) or popcorn *every single day.* Often both on the same day. Last year (September 2020 to August 2021) I spent $2,000 on fast food. In the past month of September 2021 alone, I spent $800 on McDonald’s and popcorn.

I know a lot of it is definitely psychological; I’m a grad student and I suffer from double depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. All three are stable and going pretty good though thanks to medication and exercise. But I know they also play a role because making myself food is the #1 thing I struggle with the most in my life, depressed or not. And my current semester is hectic with the final year of my master’s, two part-time jobs, my role in the student association, plus funding and PhD applications for next year. But I’m doing good generally compared to other times in my life, so I don’t know why I would emotionally eat so much. Plus, I often order fast food or popcorn even though I do have food in my fridge, which makes it seem like more of a specific craving issue, i.e., I don’t want what’s in my fridge, I want junk food. The crux of the matter is, I do want to eat comfort/junk food constantly, not even because it makes me feel good—it doesn’t anymore, it makes me feel awful—but because my brain has learned that that’s what I do when I want to numb uncomfortable feelings. 

To go back to the IE aspect of it, I know that a lot of this craving is because I have started mentally restricting again: when I noticed myself eating more and more popcorn and McDonald’s, I started telling myself, “Starting tomorrow, no more fast food” and deleting the delivery app from my phone. So this obviously just keeps leading to more craving. But here’s the kicker: I cannot financially afford to buy this food anymore. This $800 last month set me back financially big time. Plus, I don’t even *want* to eat the food from a conscious perspective because it makes me feel awful afterwards, lethargic, bloated, gassy, plus it upsets my IBS. But it’s like when a craving kicks in, I am powerless and no longer in charge.

If you made it through this novel, you’re amazing and I love you. Any and all tips are appreciated!

TL;DR Spent $800 last month on fast food, can’t continue to spend like that but trying to stop feels like restriction and the cravings feel uncontrollable. What should I do?",1633315394.0

this is my introduction. please let me know if I use words or expressions that are not allowed or triggering, I'll try to mark them as spoilers as best I can.

after years and years of being caught the restrict-binge-shame-cycle I've finally had enough. >!never lost or gained any weight!< and was just unhappy. sometimes bad body fever severely caught up with me, >!to the point of me seriously considering breast reduction surgery. !<I've tried quite a few regimes >!(""harmless"" ones like NO-S \[which is about good habits and moderation, but just made me binge\], a completely sugarfree way of living \[was convinced of being an addict, since binging is addiction-like behavior and addictions run in my families\] or very damaging ones like Bright Line Eating),!< but nothing ""worked"" in the long run, and the only thing that ever changed was my levels of shame and unhappiness. I might also have to add that I have some severe food allergies, which make eating like navigating through a minefield from the start.

>!(I also have to add that my first experience of food and body shaming happened when I was 4 \[yes FOUR\] years old, was bullied in school, had anorexia at age 10 - 12, a narcissistic mother who struggled with her weight all her life and projected it all onto her daughters.)!<

last week it hit me like a ton of bricks. I just did not want to be unhappy and envious as my husband had his cake and ate it too. I vowed to give this way of living and eating a serious try - no pressure, no shame nor guilt. made a deal with myself to eat when I was hungry and not when I wasn't. set intentions to move more for letting off steam and for enjoyment.went to the shops and market and brought home anything and everything that looked good and was compatible with my allergies.  ate at mealtimes and had dessert/snacks everyday. did not eat when I wasn't hungry and one day when I was just too upset/stressed out from work (which always results in a stomach ache. waited/cried this one out. felt a lot better in the evening. had dinner then).I moved a lot and even had a yoga session to stretch and do something nice for my back.

>!now, the ringer for me is - as a control measurement for this experiment I jumped on the scales, and have lost weight this week. it would be fine if I didn't, but the psychologist in me loves data points and working out if the set intervention is having an effect, to which side either. it's not beneath me to admit I was sort of glad that the weight shifted to ""less"" than to ""more"", but I'll fight this voice as good as I can. there'll be days when this bitch might convince me otherwise, but I'm working on it every day.!<

another thing - I've always feared that if I went IE I'd want to eat anything in sight ""once the floodgates opened"" - but I guess that's the difference to binging, you take time to listen what you need and want and most of the times it is NOT sugar, but anything else. I'm still wary if I can trust this, but after years and years>! of food addiction rhetoric and lifelong body shaming!< I guess it's normal to need some time to be fully relaxed.",1633254666.0
Challenging the voice in your head when buying food,6,q0dvwr,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/q0dvwr/challenging_the_voice_in_your_head_when_buying/,4,"So I've been on this IE journey since about March (wow, that DOES NOT feel like 6 months at all!) and I've made a ton of progress. But one issue I still find is that when I go grocery shopping, I get that voice in my head going ""I shouldn't buy this food"" because: 

1) I know I'll binge it and eat it all in one go and feel goddamn awful afterwards

2) it's ""not good for me""

3) I can't afford to keep on buying this stuff over and over again. (cause I buy so many one-item things like ready-made sandwiches, single-pack stuff, etc and end up overeating it all when I get home.)

How can I challenge that voice when shopping? Is it like: if I hear ""don't buy that"", I go ""ah well, guess I have to buy it now!! :D "".

Last week I went to the shop for a few things and saw some custard-filled doughnuts and challenged that voice despite it being a humongous fear food, and bought it! I had 1 at a time twice but then binged on the last 3 all at once and felt awful afterwards. I suppose it might be related to 2014, where my Mum died and I sort of self-harmed by bingeing stuff left-right-center and nearly died in hospital cause of it?

The curiosity sometimes takes over where I'm curious on how the food tastes/feels and how my body will react to it, but then I get scared that I'm going to eat it all or eat more than is comfortable and feel awful afterwards. Which would then make me not want to get it again. There's also financial worries, cause I can't just buy everything that looks appealing and always have a surplus stock of it, otherwise I'd have no money (I'm a Uni student)",1633250312.0

Hello!

Although I've known about IE for a good amount of time (I found out about it maybe a year ago or so?), I'm new to actively participating as an intuitive eater. I'm in the middle of reading Just Eat It, and I'm talking to my therapist about it as well.

Last night, my mom and I went out to get some ice cream, which I initially decided I wasn't hungry for, but then I shared some with my dad because I felt like if I didn't have any, I would regret it, and >!it would feel a lot like how it did when I was restricting. !<

Tonight, my mom decided she wanted to go through a drive-thru to Tim Hortons, so I went along with her. While she was talking to me in the car along the way, I could barely pay attention to her because I was still trying to figure out if I wanted something, what I wanted, and if I was hungry. Keep in mind that similar to last night, I had just finished dinner. Although my hunger cues are near non existent at this point, I can deduce/infer that I ate enough, and that I'm comfortably full.

So, basically, all these questions are popping up in my mind: Do I want the food? Is having dessert when not hungry a fear of mine? >!Is having dessert by itself a fear of mine? Am I just fearful of weight gain?!< Etc, etc, etc. 

Intuitive eating is obviously all about being in tune with your body, your feelings, your preferences, etc., but this ironically kept me inside my head rather than being present in the moment with my mother.

I ended up ordering a doughnut and it's in the fridge at the moment. My questions are:

I've been in my first year at university for about a month now, and for what feels like the first time in forever, finally have control over my own food. I'm a recovering calorie-counter/macro-obsessor and have found great comfort in the intuitive eating mindset. I'm able to enjoy late-night ice cream with friends guilt-free, and working out without doing so to look a certain way :)

Since coming to university, though, I've been struggling with over-eating. About 4-5 times a week, I eat more than is comfortable for me, but I can't seem to stop.

I was recently on holiday with my in-laws, which had lovely moments but was challenging. Since then, I have able to think a bit more critically about an unhelpful habit I have. 

Often when I've had to do things I didn't want to do and didn't enjoy, particularly with people I have difficulties with or feel do not appreciate me, I find myself obsessively eating after on my own. It is non-nutritious food, beyond fullness, compulsively, and often things that make me feel bad the next day. It's a way to give a kind of f-you to the people/situation and feel like I'm in control of my life/time/body again. Obviously it hurts me, but it's so blatantly ""not the right thing"" or not what people would tell me to do, that it has quite a power. 

Have other people experienced this? How do you approach it? I don't blame myself for it, but I don't think it is helping me in the long run and would like to build in some other options. Also interested to hear other experiences. 

I suspect one issue is that other, perhaps less damaging, habits all feel a bit like work or like things I ""ought"" to be doing- it's things like journalling, going for a walk, yoga. Whereas this is not helpful so it's a way of reacting to the pressure I feel under to do what people want of me.

Dealing with a spouse's diet culture hangups + late night snacking,38,pxf57w,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/pxf57w/dealing_with_a_spouses_diet_culture_hangups_late/,13,"My husband is semi-supportive of IE but he's also definitely got some skepticism, particularly around stuff like whether you can be fat and healthy.  I would say what he's really supportive is some kind of everything in moderation hunger-and-fullness diet, BUT that's still big progress from when he used to want to cut out large food groups, eat super clean, etc.

My husband also has a tendency to disappear into our bedroom and snack after dinner each night while I am putting our 5yo son to bed.  Usually he starts with a bowl of fruit, milk, and cheerios, which he heads off with in full view of son and I.  But then while I'm reading stories with 5yo I totally hear him going back to the kitchen and getting other stuff...M&M's, Oreos, etc.  Sometimes in the mornings I will get up and find candy wrappers or evidence of various dessert concoctions in the kitchen.

On the one hand, I don't really care what he's eating.  I 100% get that sometimes it's difficult to relax and enjoy food around our son and so I totally understand wanting to have things like chocolate, cookies, etc. in peace.  I do the same thing sometimes and I don't think it's a problem behavior in and of itself.  HOWEVER, if I finish putting our son to bed and then come in while my husband is eating one of these extra snacks, he assumes I am judging him and can get quite nasty.  Also, I have noticed that when he's eating more ""junk"" food at night he tends to notice our son's food intake more, and not in a positive way (like asking if he really needs XYZ food).  This second thing really bothers me because I don't want our son feeling bad about eating particular foods or thinking there's anything wrong with the way he eats (especially as kiddo really does seem to have a pretty good relationship with food right now and I think most people would consider his diet very balanced and ""healthy""). 

I'm not really sure what (if anything) to do about it.  I did once suggest that his scrutiny of our son's diet might be coming more out of his feelings about his own diet, it didn't go very well.  If we didn't have a kid living at home with us I might shrug and just say whatever, you have to figure this out on your own, but...we do have a kid living at home.  Thoughts?",1632861198.0

>!Hello!!<

>!I have recently made a breakthrough where I have realized that I haven't consumed the daily recommended caloric intake in a long, long time.

>!Since I haven't yet healed the relationship between my body, hunger cues, and my mind, I thought it would be a good idea to start counting my calories to make sure I'm eating enough. However, I have done some research on calorie counting, and a lot of people don't suggest doing it, because it doesn't tell you everything you need to know about nutrition and health and bodies and whatnot.

Always hungry,11,px9etu,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/px9etu/always_hungry/,7,"*sorry for the long post*

Hi guys,
I started my intuitive eating journey about a month ago after years of restricting and disordered behaviour that was only exacerbated by the pandemic. I lost some weight last summer by dieting and restricting and overall just being miserable. I have since put on about half of it back, with pandemic measures loosening there has been a lot of social eating (which has been awesome!). Anyway, fast forward to now I am loving intuitive eating. Despite my disordered past, I still have a pretty good grasp of my hunger cues and I am good at checking in with myself and knowing what I want to eat, how much and when. But lately, I am just ALWAYS hungry. I mean like I will eat a meal and be hungry pretty much immediately after. I have always been mindful of including enough protein, fat, carbs and fibre in all of my meals since I am a vegetarian and sometimes it can be challenging to get enough protein. Despite this, I find myself perpetually starving. It’s not mental hunger because I don’t particularly want to eat and no cravings - I’m just physiologically hungry. My stomach feels empty all the time and I can’t seem to satiate it. Last night I basically ate two big blocks of tofu and that kept me moderately full for maybe an hour or two 😩 I also drink a LOT of water (always have) and my physical activity level has not changed.
I’m not sure what to do - I’m pretty certain I am eating enough and I also don’t want to just stuff myself with food when I don’t feel like eating it… But I also don’t want to be perpetually starving.

&#x200B;

Hello!

I'm an intuitive eating newbie who has known about IE for quite a while now (maybe several months to a year), but have never fully involved myself in it. I haven't read any of the books (although I just saved ""Just Eat It"", so I'll start that soon), and most of my knowledge comes from the dietician, Abbey Sharpe, as well as Stephanie Buttermore. On top of that, I'm not seeking the help from a dietician or nutritionist, although I do have a therapist who I plan on talking to about all of this. All in all, I still have a long ways to go.

>!From mid-September to just a few days ago, I was heavily restricting, pretty much eating as little as I could in the name of losing weight. Obviously, this is extremely unhealthy, and while it lasted for just a little over a month before I started to involve myself in recovery, I was struggling with disordered eating and thinking before then as well.!<

>!Growing up, I had never paid too much attention to nutrition or calories, because I was raised by parents who were good at taking care of me. I knew the basics of course, but even those ideas were at least partially founded by diet culture (example: ideas about ""good"" and ""bad"" food, serving portions, etc.) Even though I was never too concerned about weight, I had/have my insecurities, and I've really never listened to my body's hunger cues. I would say I ate when I wasn't feeling hungry, but that's not even true, because while I thought I wasn't hungry, I still never ate enough.!<

This leads me to what's going on right now: since I used to think that the only real sign of being ""truly"" hungry was a grumbling/growling/empty stomach, >!I didn't realize that my almost constant fatigue and cold hands and feet were probably at least partially caused by undereating.!< Because now that I'm eating more and learning more from body-positive nutritionists, I feel more energetic and physically warm. Sort of how I used to feel before my heavy restriction era, but even better because of how informed I'm becoming day by day.

Still, I have a few questions:

\- I tend to bloat after food, no matter what I've eaten. This causes me to believe that I'm full, even if I haven't had enough fuel. Thus, I don't really feel hungry in my stomach. What can I do about this?

\- How do I know when my fatigue is caused by lack of food fuel, versus other reasons, such as my introversion, or quality of sleep, etc.?

\- What influencers, resources, etc. should I avoid? What are the red flags of a toxic nutritionist or dietician or fitness/foodie influencer? I don't want to learn from anyone who doesn't repeat diet culture rhetoric.",1632712974.0

2. Take action each week to move towards a healed relationship with food & body
3. Find body neutrality (or body positivity - you get to choose!)
4. Build friendships
5. Drop out of diet culture... for good

I used to have a whole binge and restrict cycle going on but I stopped once I realised that my body is beautiful the way it is and I should treat it as such. 

Since then, I’ve been eating whatever the heck I want. The thing is, because I’m eating whatever I want and because I’m a sweet tooth; I eat a lot of sweets. I have insulin resistance and PCOS so that lifestyle has had negative effects on my body.

I decided to try intuitive eating and also try to eat more nutritious food. I have done it for about 5 days. It’s going pretty well - I am still having sweets every day but because I am more conscious about what I put on my plate, I am fuller and crave sweet snacks less. 

My issue is the mental effects. I can’t help but feel like I’m on a diet and its stressing me out. Trying to learn my hunger cues stresses me too because I then get worried that I’m not doing it right. Overall, it is just making me very hyperaware of my body and whats going on inside.

I don’t care about my weight. I am working with a therapist to accept my authentic self and that involves body acceptance. However, I have been dieting non-stop since the age of 9.

It is part of ""wellness culture"", would break the bank, is intended for people with a medical condition and can actually cause that medical condition in people who don't have it but do it as a ""lifestyle"" anyway. I was back at square one really.

My family are all doing this ""lifestyle"", two out of genuine need and one for what appear to be the same reasons as me. So when Im at their place its hard not to think its the ""right way"". If they all ate standing up or using wooden spoons I'd also do the same thinking its the ""right way"". It's monkey see monkey do.

I realised this ""lifestyle"" would completely isolate me from my partner. He's a good cook but I wouldn't be able to enjoy anything he made me or brought home from his friend's restaurant. He's literally starting a job where he does night shifts baking bread. And how the fork is a 33 year old undereducated Kurdish man supposed to know what a flaxseed bun or a naturally sweetened arrowroot brownie is?

I love him so much. I think watching his confidence in eating has made him my ""reason to recover"" from using food restriction in an attempt to manage stress. I like when he feeds me with a spoon as an affection thing. I don't want to create a restrictive household for my daughter(?).

Advice?",32,pa80vp,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/pa80vp/learning_to_ear_intuitively_when_i_have_no/,11,"Hi. I have read the rules of this sub so will tread carefully with my language but that is a bit tricky because of my goals so I apologize in advance if I’ve got something wrong and please do politely point it out and I’ll make edits.

I grew up with a parent who fed me huge adult size portions of nutritionally sparse foods. I don’t want to say ‘pleasure food’ because I didn’t enjoy eating an entire pizza and a huge portion of fries with no vegetables for dinner every other night. In her worldview, every meal must have dessert. Breakfast was cereal with about four tablespoons of sugar in the milk, lunch had a dessert like an eclair or even two, or an individual cheesecake. Packed lunches to school were miniature cakes, crisps, cheese strings, candy, Nutella sandwiches. Dinner would be something like an entire pack of pot-noodles, deep fried fried and maybe some mushrooms drenched in butter. Dessert was mandatory and was usually some sort of creamy cake. I was very rarely given fruit or vegetables and as an adult I’ve come to love so many fruit and veg I had never even tasted. I love cooking for myself and my SO. I still love ramen and pizza but not the sort of stuff I used to get as a kid.

My problem is that I don’t have any sense of being hungry or being full. I only have a feeling of being uncomfortably stuffed and my body doesn’t signal to me that I’m done with food until I get there. If you gave me a slice of pizza I would eat it. If you gave me a whole pizza, I’d eat it. It’s not the ideal way I want to live as I want to be able to follow my body’s signals. They just need jumpstarting and I don’t know how as when I’ve tried in the past I just seem to lack the instinct. I’ve read some info from a dietician but not read any specific books and not in a position to go and see someone about this.

I’m not looking to lose or gain weight, I’m pretty happy with where I am. I recently lost a load of muscle being inactive over lockdown but I’m back to activity. This sometimes makes the problem worse as I end up eating four or five meals a day because of activity.

But sometimes I find myself wondering if my ability to listen to my body's cues is rooted in the fact that I know that doing so has kept me lean. I'm wondering if I suddenly starting gaining weight - due to pregnancy, medication, lifestyle, or hormones - if I would still be able to listen to my body in the same way that I have been for the past few years.

In short: is it okay for me to think, 'well, if this stopped working, I would try something new,' or does that in itself violate a crucial tenet of I.E.? 

Am I overthinking this? Can anyone relate?

I've been trying to do IE for about 3 years now, some successfullly, and some fallbacks into disordered behaviour - not intentionally, if I feel out of control, I stop being able to eat. Have had eating disorder since I was a young child.  
I've not restricted for several months now, Jan-March was back in anorexic behaviour though it did not affect my weight at all. I'm a larger size and have been the same clothes size for 3 years. I don't weigh myself, only done a few times at Dr office. Just saying this for context, as with anorexic behaviour some would expect me being very thin. 

  
Anyway I've recently fallen back into eating to comfort myself, or eating when I'm stressed. It doesn't affect my weight as at the moment I seem to be stable no matter what I do, so this is not about weight gain/loss or anything like that. My issue is that this additional eating makes me feel physically uncomfortable and sick, whilst not actually meeting my need for comfort and stress relief in a very effective way. I basically still feel uncomfortable and stressed, but the nausea overshadows it - though in reality it just means feeling even worse.   


Obviously I'm having some emotional needs that I'm not meeting in other ways like I used to, but I had to give up yoga due to joint issues, and meditation just puts me straight to sleep. 

Does anyone have any IE suitable resources for how to deal with this kind of thing? I'm not looking to restrict, I'm just looking to find better ways to meet emotional needs, as I'm finding this way does not work very well and rather makes me feel sick and thus more stressed. I've done all the mindfulness things I can think of, yoga being the one that works for me, but I can not do yoga without dislocating my hips and stuff now due to a genetic condition  :(",1629490887.0

&#x200B;

Like many of us, I used to be a slave to MyFitnessPal.  I would absolutely agonize over getting all my numbers just right (and of course, rarely did, and would then have a ""fuck it"" binge as a result).  Well, my doctor recently expressed some concern that I might be at risk for a health condition that could potentially be managed via diet and exercise.  Looking at the info she gave me, I thought ""hmmm, I feel like I'm already pretty close to all this"" and of course got to wondering if I'm just kidding myself about my diet.  So I decided okay, I'm going to log into MFP and log just a couple of days for a reality check.

First, OMG, it's so much work!  I eat a big variety of produce and having to enter in the multiple different vegetables in each of my meals was exhausting.  No wonder I used to eat so much packaged diet food.  It's way easier to track!

Next, the diet advice I had gotten was focused more on balancing macronutrients than on total calories, so of course I wanted to take a look at the macros part of the info.  And so much of it was SO out of whack!  If I calculated my daily calories as a function of my macros I was coming up with something \~1000 calories higher than the totals MFP was reporting.  I eventually found the culprits (a couple of items had about 10x as many fat grams in MFP as in real life).  In looking through my food in more detail, I also noticed that some micronutrients were way off.  No, 2 cups cauliflower does not contain 60% of your RDA of calcium.

I threw up my hands in disgust, closed the browser window, and instead brainstormed a short list of small positive changes I could make to better manage my health risk.  I've picked two of the easiest ones and am going to work on making them into a habit, and will then see how that's going in a month or so and decide whether or not adding more is sustainable.",1629468202.0

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it. 

[Here's the graphics that he sent me](https://imgur.com/a/8khKgbT). It tells you why those ingredients make your muscles inflamed. 

For your information, I have zero dietary allergies.

I think I have a fear of movement,7,p7j4f9,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/p7j4f9/i_think_i_have_a_fear_of_movement/,10,"CW for anxiety (I guess? Nothing really jumps out as particularly triggering, let me know if it would be helpful to add a tw!) 

I've been following IE for about 10 months, going through the steps and making peace with food and with my body. I've used the workbook but have not sought out professional assistance (could potentially, but there are not many HAES/IE practitioners in my area). It feels incredible to have trust with myself and with food again. One part of IE that is particularly challenging to me is joyful movement, and I think I've realized it's because I'm scared of it. 

I grew up a D1 bound athlete with my father as my coach, absolutely loving sports and running around outside as a kid. As soon as I hit puberty I developed PCOS and went from being a bigger kid to being a fat teenager. Workouts for my sport started to focus on weightloss, muscle gain, maximizing athletic efficiency and punishing my body for not being perfect. I put in extra workouts to become the best athlete I could be, ignoring injury and rest to the detriment of my health. 

That mindset has permeated all forms of movement since I was 12 years old, and even now when I'm trying to move for joy and not for efficiency, I can't seem to shake the expectation that movement is tied up with punishment and shame. For example, if I go on a walk (on a route I've completed hundreds of times at this point), I spend the entire time fearing what will happen if I can't complete the route. I'm terrified of having to stop and sit and see people gawk or yell or laugh at me for not being able to do what I ""should"" be able to. 

Logically, I know having to stop and take a break is not shameful, and listening to one's body is in fact a good practice, and also that no one is paying attention to me. But the thing is, I'm almost anticipating the shame to the point of stopping before I feel any form of discomfort. I'll be walking along, totally fine, and then a thought will pop into my head about not being able to make it home, and I'll cut my walk short out of the fear instead of out of needing to make my route shorter. Or I'll think of it before going out for a walk/swim/yoga session and then I won't do it at all. 

I'm not sure how to work through this. I've spent half my life engaging in movement as punishment, as something to fail or succeed at, and I have no idea where to start unpacking this and the fear I've come to associate with it. Has anyone else dealt with thoughts like these? How have you started to work through it?",1629393122.0

A little background on me: my ex step mother forced me into a diet when I was in 5th grade. Since then, I’ve always struggled with how I looked and have gone through a large variety of diets. I love food though, and really got stuck in the cycles of like “last supper” type meals— “last time and then we’ll be good.”

A little under a year ago I went to a fat positive friend, trying to understand how she was so happy. And she sent me a bunch of resources to try to surround myself with fat positive individuals. She also mentioned intuitive rating and joyful movement. But I was so engulfed in the idea of not dieting and trying not to look at food as good or bad that I didn’t look a whole lot into it.

I find all of this exciting and so incredibly welcome after years of stressing about calories/numbers etc.

I’ve read about fat acceptance and HAES, which I love and am totally in support of, but at this weight it’s more a matter of health/ risk of disease etc.

Over the last few years, I had been trying to lose weight and was either ""eating healthy"" although not calorie counting but trying not to eat too much chocolate or takeaways and then ending up eating nothing but chocolate and takeaways for a week or two before starting again.
So for the last month and a half, I've been working om intuitive eating and allowing myself to eat all the foods that I've viewed as ""unhealthy ""
That started out with lots of takeaways but I'm reaching a place with those where I'm feeling I can take or leave them and craving food that doesn't leave me feeling as sluggish and drowsy. 
But chocolate! I could eat it for days. I've had days where that's all Ive eaten for meals. It makes me feel pretty crap physically afterwards but I constantly crave it and once I start I can't stop. I keep going until I'm close to bursting. 
Do I keep going as I'm going and hope it burns itself out eventually? 
Also should probably mention that I've been quite stressed recently which isn't helping and I do tend to comfort eat.",1628970205.0

I just need a little encouragement / reminder of why calorie counting is harmful (even the type pushed as ""healthy"" bc only a ""small"" deficit. I am trying so hard not to go back to calorie counting but my mind keeps trying to convince me that;  


\- it will work  
\- it's not ""that bad""  
\- I am just making excuses by not calorie counting  


Thanks :))

How to cope with ED thoughts while trying to engage in IE.,3,p4fk66,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/p4fk66/how_to_cope_with_ed_thoughts_while_trying_to/,3,"I’ve been doing IE for a month, mostly using the Tribole/Resch book and workbook. I’m nearly 40 and started developing ED behaviours after turning 30. I have to recover for my children’s sake, and professional help is unlikely as I’m a normal weight (although I have asked for it). So I’m using IE to try to recover. 

The rapid weight gain is very distressing to me and this came to a head today whilst my partner, and I were shopping. We went into a charity shop and I forgot that I had donated some stuff there a few weeks ago. I immediately saw two items of clothing that used to be mine when I was thin. We had to leave that shop and we tried to look around some normal clothes shops but I couldn’t stop crying, so we went back to our car.

My partner tried so hard to be kind and supportive, but she said that maybe IE wasn’t right for me as I clearly can’t cope with the weight gain it’s causing. She talked about finding a middle ground and how she and I could maybe try making more healthy choices together and having a generally healthier diet. Not counting calories but choosing foods based on how healthy they are. Well I just heard that as “you need to start restricting again” and I said so, which really upset my partner as she was just trying to help me figure stuff out.

It’s the blind leading the blind, neither of us know how to cope with this. I believe I have to do IE because anything else is restriction and that will lead back to ED behaviours. She totally gets that, but then she sees how much distress the weight gain is causing me and so she wonders if IE is right for me. But I really need her to keep encouraging me to do IE no matter what. If she so much as wavers on her acceptance of how much I’m eating and how big I’m getting, I feel like I can’t carry on with this. It’s an unfair amount of pressure to put on her and I fully realise that. 

Will the ED thoughts recede if I just stick to IE? Will I feel comfortable with my size one day? Will I learn to dress my new shape? I just keep buying clothes two sizes too big to hide it, then feeling self conscious about looking like a teletubby. I would be really grateful for any messages of hope, thank you.

Struggling,8,p45umg,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/p45umg/struggling/,7,"Slight TW; I won't be mentioning numbers but I will be referencing Eating Disorder Behaviours for relevant context only  


Hello,  
I am a female in my 20's and I have been struggling with multiple eating disorders from the age of about seven. I have cycled through all different stages of weight / health. For the past 4 years I have been in a cycle of bingeing and restricting, which, as I am sure some of you can relate to - has been very hard on my body (dramatic weight fluctutaions, hair/nail damage/ alcohol abuse / purging etc) and on my emotional wellbeing (has made me miserable)  


I have been in eating disorder treatment several times in the past, but have been out of that system for over 5 years as I am no longer underweight (aka, they won't offer me any services). I have an independent therapist but she doesn't specialise in ed, specialists virtually don't exist where I am. For the past 6 months, I have been trying to heal my relationship with food and I have just found it so so difficult. I oscillate all the time between counting calories / trying to lose weight and eating intuitively and trying to love myself. I just feel so hopeless. The past week I have been trying to motivate myself by learning new recipes and cooking for others - but it doesn't feel good to me, it feels pathetic.   


The desire to lose weight, even though I have experienced first hand how much it ruined my life and almost killed me, is so so strong and I just can't seem to shake it. I think about losing weight all the time and it fills me with so much shame. I have read all of the books on HAES and deconstructing fatphobia. I have tried focussing on other things, I have tried body nuetrality. ANd I don't mean tried as in ""tried once"" - I mean over years.  


I just feel desperate. I don't want to nor can I (physically) starve myself anymore. The thought of having to fills me with dread and paralyses me with fear. However, the idea of never losing weight or perhaps gaining more does the same thing.   


I have completely bought into toxic diet culture that tells me I can lose weight in a way that is sustainable. That I can be beautiful no matter what I look like. That how I look in this world as this woman isn't a commodity. None of those things are true, and it sucks.  


I just don't know what to do and have no one in my life (bar my therapist) to talk about this to. I don't really know what I am hoping to get from this post but please - if you have any advice or suggestions, I would really appreciate it :)",1628938105.0

I just got the results of my most recent bloodwork back and saw that I have borderline high triglycerides. the number isn’t necessarily alarming, but I have family history of diabetes or prediabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure from both my parents, so I just want to make sure I keep an eye on it and don’t let it get to a level where it affects my health or may need medication. 

upon my first search for how to lower my triglycerides, it was all restriction of foods and an increase movement. this sent me down a small, but noticeable, shame spiral of needing to lose weight, which is ultimately not what I want. I obviously don’t want to restrict anything but would rather incorporate more of other things. any recommendations for what to add to my gentle nutrition?

for automod: I’ve been consistently practicing IE for over 2 years now, but have yet to read the books.

EDIT: after reading the medication package insert for my hormonal birth control pill to see if there were any know  interactions with other meds, I learned that a common side effect is an increase in triglycerides!! bc I don’t plan on using another type of birth control or stopping the use of this one any time soon, my doctor and I agreed that it’s not something I need to worry about at the moment. if I still notice a number above the normal range after I stop using this particular birth control method, then I can/will start focusing more on my diet and exercise.",1628792983.0

Is intuitive eating supposed to be complete lack of restriction and structure in the beginning?

I get hungry at night pretty often cause I tend to stay up late and there are times I eat right before going to sleep and I don't feel good about it. I also feel like if I could cut that out I would be much healthier and probably wouldn't even be putting on the weight that I've been putting on since I started IE.

How to exercise when in “binge mode”?,18,p00e02,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/p00e02/how_to_exercise_when_in_binge_mode/,12,"TW: Binge eating

Okay, when I exercise, even 20 mins, I’ve noticed it has a dramatic improver effect on: 

(1) my ability to actually cook good meals for myself rather than feeling completely overwhelmed as I stare into the abyss of the fridge, shutting the door and resigning myself to be hungry, or reaching for literally any food as I’ve realised it’s better for me to to eat than not eat (I have GERD so not eating is really bad for me). But then when I eat it’s often way past the point of fullness and I’ll feel uncomfortable for hours after. 

(2) my ability to “hear” my hunger cues of hungry and full. I rarely overeat when I’ve exercised that day.

(3) my mental well-being as I feel much calmer.

BUT I really struggle to make myself exercise. Growing up, and being forced on a diet as young as 7 yo, exercise was only ever about losing weight and never about building confidence, strength, etc. I’ve never succeeded in making exercise a consistent part of my life, though I’ll have phases of doing quite well with it, and I really marvel at people who’ve managed to make it just a normal thing in their lives.

Note, I also have ADHD which is a fab contributor to my lack of executive functioning 👌🏻

Has anyone cracked this? How do you exercise? How do you deal with overeating tendencies if you’re unable to muster up the willpower to exercise?

Thanks!

Because of said health condition my relationship with food is all messed up. It has turned into a cycle of restrict, binge, purge. I have started seeing a registered dietician who explained Intuitive eating to me. I just started reading the book. 


Oh boy does it sound freeing and lovely. But for me, and me alone, I need to decrease my body weight. For my health, for managing my (many) health conditions.

I'm not saying I want to be ""thin"" or have the ""perfect"" body... but I feel I had discovered a size in which my body existed well in but my eating disorders messed it all up. And I and I alone liked that size much better. Trust, I was definitely not ""skinny"" by any means. Just smaller, curvier...

Approx. 5 years ago in high school (11th grade) I went off dairy to help w my acne Bc I heard some people are sensitive to it and it makes their skin react. There was a slight difference, but honestly I think it was mostly in my head/nothing CRAZY noticeable with my skin happened. I thought it helped so I continued w it and kind of became extreme w the no dairy rule. (Would exclude breads or any kind of food w even a little bit of dairy). I lowkey became crazy and obsessed w it. 
I know several people who do muscle testing/eastern medicine and I asked to test and they did say I was sensitive,, then they told me I was ALSO sensitive to breads lol.
Flash forward through first semester of college and a mission trip. This is when I felt so restricted I started a binge cycle on what people would say “healthy foods”. I’d sometimes eat till i was sick on hummus and crackers, nuts, oatmeal etc. 
I inevitably gained about 30 lbs (115 to 145 ish) and self esteem dropped which made binging worse. I THOUGHT I WAS BEING HEALTHY, so in my mind I was like HUH????
Since I’ve been home for a year I’ve dropped the weight back down Bc of lowered stress and good food habits. and this last week I really realized I had an eating disorder (ortherexia w binging). 

Im trying to become an intuitive eater and find food freedom so THIS WEEK I made some big steps and decided to add dairy and gluten and other fear food things like desserts and pizza back into my diet!! 
IVE NOTICED- I don’t feel bloated anymore (Kinda weird), skin looks the same pretty much, no stomach aches like I thought I’d get adding dairy and gluten back in (also weird considering how long I’ve been off it.)

sharing my story and why i’m here,27,oydu18,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/oydu18/sharing_my_story_and_why_im_here/,11,"hey everyone! i came across this community recently and i just felt so relieved. it’s so inspiring to read so many of your wins and see people sharing how they healed their relationship with food and their bodies. 

i’ve been feeling lost for quite a while now, and i think the best step for me is to share my story and seek some guidance. so here it goes: 

at 22 years old, i have been trying to lose weight for over a decade. ever since i was a kid, some of my relatives used to call me “fatty” as a “joke”. i think i got my first “you need to lose weight” comment when i was about 10 or 11 from my grandmother. and since then, i have resented myself and hated my body. but of course that first comment isn’t where it stopped. when i say i constantly heard the same thing, i do genuinely mean that it was like a biweekly or monthly occurrence. if it wasn’t my grandma, it was another relative. when i was a kid, it had more to do with calling me chubby or squishy. as i grew up, i was told bluntly that i was fat and i should take care of my body. 

as the youngest of four girls, i saw my sisters try every diet too. from juice cleanses to the “boiled egg” diet, to completely cutting out carbs. i did many of these diets with them. i look back at this and don’t understand why this was even allowed in my house. but, my parents are immigrants and i’ll just chalk it up to the fact that they didn’t really know any better. 

when i was 17, i asked my doctor for some help with losing weight. she wrote me a referral to a “dietician” which really turned out to be a diet clinic. they gave me an approved list of foods that i was allowed to eat. essentially, it was greens and some form of protein. i wasn’t “allowed” to eat any fruit, or certain vegetables because they had too much sugar. i wasn’t allowed to consume dairy because it had too much sugar in it. but basically, i had to go in every 2 weeks and they would weigh me and calculate my percent body fat using a  scale. after the weigh-in, i had to chat with one of the dieticians and discuss my “progress”. i was straight up body shamed and ridiculed by these so-called professionals. before i even started this ridiculous diet, i had a horrible view of myself. this turned the dial to 11. the diet had phases, once i lost a certain amount, i could move on to the next phase and introduce more food varieties (for those wanting to know more, this was the dr. poon diet). not carbs though, because carbs are evil. i went for 6 months and lost about 20 pounds (up and down) over the course of that time. i had to stop because i was travelling and it would be difficult to keep up with it while abroad. lo and behold, within that one month of not restricting myself as much, i gained back 5 of those pounds. soon after, i refused to go back and gained the rest of the weight back (and more). i was so mad at myself. as i was losing this weight, i got so many compliments from my family. but it was always followed by a “keep going” or “you’ll reach your goal” but at what cost? i was in grade 12 and should have been enjoying my last year of high school. instead i felt guilty about drinking a sip of milk. i’ve never typed this out before, but this experience ruined me. and it makes me so angry now that i believed i had to put myself through that to be happy. i also hate how people that were supposed to care about me let me be miserable just so i could lose weight and finally be “healthy”. not that it matters, but i wasn’t even that horribly overweight when i look back. i was only 17. 

but that’s not where it ends. i gained the weight back and heard so much bs about how i quit. i never told anyone how lonely and isolated i felt. how much i completely hated myself (and still do to this day). 

every time i go back to this doctor, and i do genuinely believe she is a good doctor, just not aware of how harmful her weight stigma is, she tells me i need to cut out carbs to lose weight. i don’t understand how a medical doctor that has been MY doctor for almost my whole life, can still have this view. i don’t know how to have this conversation with her. how do i tell her not to speak to me about this type of weight loss? 

every year since then, i have tried restrictive diets. and every time, i get consumed by them. i’ve tried so many ways to lose weight and as cliche as this sounds, i lost myself along the way. i would come home in the summers between uni and try my best to lose weight. as soon as i’d go back to school and get busy again, it would always come back. there has not been one diet or one program i have done where the weight didn’t come back. now i struggle to separate any activity from weight loss. i started walking at the beginning of the pandemic for my mental health. a few weeks later, i noticed my clothes started fitting “better” and this immediately caused me to get in my head. not short after, i stopped going on those walks. in the year and a bit since, i have tried to get back into walking because it genuinely made me feel good. but every time, i link it to weight loss and i stop. it’s like a mental block. it doesn’t matter if i say i’m doing it for my mental health, my brain has become wired in a way that always leads me down that path. 

so, in short, i’m here because i’m struggling. i want to join the intuitive eating movement, but i’m terrified that i’ll focus on weight loss. again. my relationship with my own self image, my body, food—it shattered years ago. i want to put it back together. i have a strong feeling that this group will help me do that. but i just really felt the need to get this off my chest. 

if you have a similar story and have been successful in your IE journey, i would really appreciate any advice.

I'm Abbey and I'm 16.  I have a history of mental illness.  I have been in recovery since I was 12-13 for Anorexia.  Today I still struggle with anxiety and depression, and have been diagnosed with ADHD.  I feel that my eating disorder no longer controls me, but naturally the occasional negative thought does appear but I have gotten really good at catching myself and going ""hey that's not right, you're okay"".  I'm really proud of myself and I think I've come a long way.

&#x200B;

I have loved the idea of intuitive eating for a while now as it really aligns with my values.  When it comes to food and eating I'm pretty good.  I'm not afraid to get a big fat donut when I'm out with friends, and ENJOY it.  I feel comfortable having 'treats' whenever I want.  

I think my biggest issue is I don't actually know what being comfortably full feels like.  I know what hungry feels like, and I know what uncomfortably full feels like.  I have noticed that I snack a lot when I am watching a movie or something.  Now while there's absolutely no issue with snacking (love it!) the issue for me is I do it when I'm not actually hungry, and then I end up feeling uncomfortably full and bloated, and it's not a nice feeling.  I have a feeling that may be because of my adhd.

I read “Health at Every Size” and it triggered diet thinking and behaviors.,31,oxcjyj,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/oxcjyj/i_read_health_at_every_size_and_it_triggered_diet/,24,"TL/DR: read the HAES book and the nutrition portion triggered diet thinking and diet behaviors for me. Then I read Christy Harrison’s “Anti-Diet” immediately after and it saved me. I’m fine now. Whew! Am I the only one who has experienced this with the HAES book?


I recently read “Health at Every Size” by Lindo Bacon. It is very well researched, informative, and helpful in contextualizing the harmful and incorrect ideas our culture and medical establishments perpetuate about the importance of an individual’s weight. 

And, there’s a section about the quality of foods we eat, the importance of fiber, and a strong and clear message advocating for the benefits of a mostly “plant based” diet. 

Undoubtedly, Bacon’s work has been incredibly important and influential in raising awareness around many of the deeply insidious and systemic wrongs that take place when weight is used as a benchmark of person’s health and worth. And I know that Bacon also endorses the practice of intuitive eating in their book. 

BUT I was left feeling like, in the same breath, readers are told to eat intuitively but, some foods are better than others and you should be eating better…

Am I the only one who felt this way? Has anyone else found themselves doing great with IE only to suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves following “health-based” food rules??? The one saving grace for me that pulled me back from the edge was that I immediately start reading Christy Harrison’s “Anti-Diet” book after Bacon’s book and it not only saved me from myself but made me aware of just how affected I was by the nutrition portion of the HAES book. I want to take the good things from what I read but I feel I need to first talk about and resolve these feelings with you, the community I love and appreciate and who I need most in times like this!

I have been practicing Intuitive eating for a while now.  Most days I can follow my hunger and appetite pretty well. I will feel my hunger and something will pop into my head that i think I may want to eat and i eat that.


Lately though my hunger has been much more subtle and when I try to honor it and think about what I want to eat nothing comes to mind.  I really don't feel like eating and nothing sounds good.

This is a first for me.  What do you guys do when this sort of thing happens.

Is this a cue just not to eat anything for a while until my brain settles on something that it wants?

I don't want to force myself to eat.  I was really enjoying the flow that comes with intuitive eating.  Maybe this is just something i haven't experienced yet?

Today I am feeling very confused and disheartened after it dawned on me that IE and TFID are not the same thing. I’ve been reading both at the same time but probably following TFID more. I’m almost three weeks in and I feel like maybe I’ve wasted that time and need to start from scratch! 

It seems that IE is all about mindful eating, and precise measures of hunger and satiety, whereas TFID rejects both those things. IE is telling me to eat without distractions and rate my hunger and fullness before, during and after eating; TFID is telling me I can eat whenever I want, in whatever situation, with whatever distractions, even if I’m not actually hungry. I don’t know which to believe!

I am now worried that I follow IE to the letter I will end up with too many rules and regulations and that will allow my (mostly restrictive) ED to fight back against my attempts to recover; but if I follow TFID i will just binge and binge and not actually learn or change. 

I’m also kinda nervous about believing everything Caroline Dooner says, as she isn’t actually a scientist and some of her claims are factually wrong (e.g. that people with binge eating disorder will by definition have no history of dieting!). I’m very much tempted to renounce her book, entertaining as it is, and go with the experts. 

Does anyone have any experience of using both and making it work, or any suggestions of which one I should go with to start off? (I have a seven year history of dieting, in which fasting has played a massive part for the last 2-3 years and has led to an ED in my opinion).",1627918013.0

.

.

.

So I had a hearty breakfast this morning - toast, two eggs, a few slices of haloumi cheese (yum) and spinach. Delicious! After eating all that, I found myself suddenly craving something sweet. My diet brain immediately said - ""hold on there a minute! You just ate a whole big breakfast! You can't possibly be hungry now."" So I didn't eat the sweet. About an hour later, I started feeling the onset of a headache. Usually it will be triggered by something, so I thought back the last hour or so as to what could have possibly given me a headache...and thought of sugar. 

I went to get the ibuprofen which I usually use to dispel headaches, but decided to try something else instead - so I went to the fridge and took out the package of Pepperidge Farm cookies. After eating one, I almost immediately felt the edge go off my headache. After eating another, it eased more. 

This is so simple, yet so shocking to me! My entire breakfast didn't contain any sugar (except a bit in the sourdough) - clearly that was what my body wanted. So rather than staving off the craving, telling myself to wait on the cookies until I ""deserved"" it (what does that even mean??), I actually listened to my body's cues. 

This is also interesting, because a big part of me resisting sweets, especially in the morning, is from fear that I won't be able to stop. I think this is a common diet mentality phenomenon - sweets have to be pushed off as long as possible, or I'll just spend the whole day eating them, instead of ""good"" food. But now, as I sit here slowly nibbling on that third cookie, I realize - I am not binging. I am not ""out of control."" I am eating something that tastes delicious and satisfies my hunger cues. And if I end up wanting more cookies later, that's ok too!",1627917241.0

I have just recently decided to embark on my body acceptance and intuitive eating journey. I have read the Intuitive Eating book, as well as a few other books, and have been following intuitive eating dietitians and the like on social media for quite some time before making this decision. 

I have a few questions that you more seasoned individuals may be able to help me with who may be, or have been, in a similar situation as me. For background, I have been a compulsive overeater/binge eater since 13, *pre-dieting*. Regularly eating to a 10 on the hunger scale to the point of nausea, regardless of hunger, multiple times a day. The eating became worse after dieting of course. I gained weight due to overeating (bingeing) and tried to lose it with my first diet (unsuccessful of course). Things only became worse from there as you all may have guessed. Yo-Yo dieting from 13 to 24. Typical story. Dieting has only made things worse, and I am so done. 

I am curious if any of you started out like me. Bingeing that existed *pre-dieting*, and was exacerbated by dieting, and where are you now having been an intuitive eater? What did that process look like for you? I am also looking to get into therapy for emotional reasons, as I am sure my binge eating is at least partially emotional in nature since it was not originally caused by restriction, rather exacerbated by it.",1627830292.0

I have read the IE book. I have a history of different eating disorders since 2013, and currently struggling with bulimic tendencies. So I have a lot of subconscious food rules that I've developed over the course of 8 years.

This might be a really obvious realisation; in fact, I think it is a very trivial realisation for most people. 

Whenever I have a pack of things, or bake a batch of things that can be counted in numbers (like cookies, pieces of brownies, or candies in a bag with different colours) I always feel the need to eat a complete group of them (eg: if I was eating Haribos, I would them in sets - one set including a piece of gummy in each colour). This applies to leaving foods uneaten as well: I would need to leave cookies in pairs, or have an even number or one of each variety (of flavours/colours) so that I can also eat it correctly the next time. It sounds a bit crazy, but it was just a compulsion that I would always feel. As far as I know I don't have ADHD or OCD, or any diagnosed mental disorder/illness... so I think I'm just very particular about having the ""perfect set"" to eat if I leave any leftovers.

Yesterday, I fried some sesame balls filled with red bean filling (delicious), and there were 10 of them. I ate 2 - an even number - and wanted a third, but didn't want to leave behind seven balls. So, I decided not to eat a third. A few hours later, I really wanted another ball, so convinced myself that I could eat another one, and would not indulge my compulsion to eat a fourth so that I could leave behind an even number. So, I ate a third ball and resisted the fourth. 

It sounds so trivial but it was such a huge thing for me. I woke up this morning and had one sesame ball with my coffee, and didn't feel a compulsion to check to see if there were still an even number of sesame balls left for later. I guess I am starting to realise that my own satiation and cravings are justification enough to eat, and that I don't have to follow these strange rules I have set for myself.",1627806363.0

I was especially fond of breakfast buffets with bacon and eggs and all the different cheese and meat platters. When on vacation with my family I was really looking forward to them. But my mum somewhen decided that I was fat. So I was restricted from the bacon and from the cheese, everything was frowned upon and I was not allowed to go back for seconds and was always told my first plate was too full as well.

So I did what every intelligent child would do: I got sneaky. I eat my bacon directly from the plate before going back to the table. I hid my cheese under a tomato. Also I learned that all thia food ia bad.

When I got older, I internalized my mother's judgement. I stopped hiding the cheese, instead only took the tomato. I hated myself for wanting the bacon.

Today I ate at a breakfast buffet. I took the bacon, I took the eggs, I took the cheese. One normal serving, because I knew I could back for seconds, thirds or more. After this one plate, I was full. I was happy. I never felt that way before. Because I knew I could have all the bacon, I didn't need it.

My former occupation was a mystery shopper at a mass retail store, which had me walking for nearly 8 hours straight, but I wasn't happy at that job due to my mental health, I took a leave to look for another job that won't leave me miserable, I switched as an online focus group participant where I test out new products before they hit the stores, online consumer surveys, attending live webcam discussions regarding the said product or service that I'm researching for marketing purposes, big and small companies. It's safe to say my level of activity has greatly reduced, as to where as I'm not so hungry to the point where I'm full just by eating a bowl of cereal or pasta. Basically, I now have the appetite of a young child, I'm used to eating 2 bigger meals but now with my lower level of physical activity, I almost forget to eat because I'm so occupied with my job, life, family, etc. I know I've asked this before, but yo anybody who switched to a desk or office job, have you yourself noticed any changes in your hunger?

"For those who have no recollection of ever eating intuitively, it can help to use a mental model of something else you do intuitively! TW: Alcohol",119,osxd1c,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/osxd1c/for_those_who_have_no_recollection_of_ever_eating/,14,"I was put on diets as early as I can remember. I don’t have any memories of eating intuitively. In fact, I didn’t know people ate intuitively from childhood then lost it because of dieting until I listened to Food Psych. When she asks people about their relationship with food and the guests say they ate intuitively until they were 20, I just absolutely cannot relate. I thought everyone had the same disordered thoughts that my whole family had. They just had some insane will power that I didn’t. 

Anyways something that really really helped me was thinking about other areas where I can be intuitive. My main example is drinking alcohol. I don’t usually drink. Maybe once every couple of months I’ll have a moderate craving for a beer or some cocktail and I’ll go get it. I usually drink a few sips or maybe finish the drink then be mindful about how I feel. Usually I get a headache even with a small amount, but I enjoy the slight buzz. Every few months I’ll have a big night out with friends where I don’t feel guilty for drinking a lot. I feel like crap the next day but usually it was worth it for the experience and then the purely miserable hangover the next few days helps remind me why I only do it occasionally. 

I know my relationship with alcohol is not the same as it is for everyone, but my relationship with alcohol has provided me with a mental model I can look at to understand intuitive eating. I’m pretty intuitive with drinking, I don’t feel shame drinking or not drinking. I can easily scale up or down based on the occasion, but I generally don’t have intense cravings or think about alcohol at all. I pay attention to how it makes me feel and I know how to balance those trade offs. 

My point is that if you are struggling with understanding how intuitive eating works, think about some examples you can use that are similar. They may not be a 1 to 1 comparison but the important part is that you understand what listening to your intuition is like! 

For some this could be exercise, engaging in hobbies intuitively, managing your social energy levels, sleeping, water/hydration, screen time/social media, sexual function, etc!",1627426750.0

I am vegan out of concern for animals and the planet, definitely NOT because I dislike dairy food. And herein lies the problem, I have a lot of foods which are forbidden (and therefore highly desirable) because they contain animal products. It’s got nothing to do with how fatty, sugary, calorific etc they are. It’s a normal part of my life to feel “deprived” due to my veganism, eg I go to the ice cream stand and can’t buy anything because there are no vegan options, or I go to a cafe and can’t have a cake when everyone else can. I find I am now fantasising about non-vegan foods as I proceed with IE. What should I do? If I continue resisting those foods and feeling deprived, will it interfere with my IE journey? I’m thinking of switching to just being vegetarian for a while, which wouldn’t have the same problem attached to it, as I’ve never eaten meat so I don’t really see it as a food.

Eating Not For Hunger/ Eating With Conditions,3,oswcuu,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/oswcuu/eating_not_for_hunger_eating_with_conditions/,6,"Hi, I have so many questions but these are two of the biggest ones bothering me right now. I’m very new, I started IE two weeks ago, no professional help, I’m listening to the Tribole/Resch audiobook and working through the workbook. I’m 39 and had been dieting since age 32, and over the past year I’m pretty sure my dieting was tipping over into an eating disorder. I decided to try to recover because of the effects on my partner and children. 

After starting IE, I binged like mad for a few days before deciding to really try to listen and respond to my hunger and fullness cues. To help me do this I made a rule that I will no longer read while eating. Reading while eating is one of my biggest pleasures in life, but nowadays it is too distracting and always leads to a binge. So question 1: am I doing the right thing here? Or am I placing an unhelpful condition on my eating i.e. “You can eat as long as you don’t read at the same time?” And also “You can eat as long as you don’t binge?”.

I’m also trying really hard not to eat for reasons other than hunger, like tiredness, stress, sadness, habit etc. But I am wondering what to do at times when it is socially normal to eat without hunger. Say, popcorn at the cinema, or the bar of chocolate my partner and I normally split between us on a Saturday night. If I fancy that food, and/or I want it because an experience feels incomplete without it, but I’m actually not hungry, is that ok? Or will it mess up my hunger cues?

As you can probably tell, I struggle with black-and-white thinking. The vagueness and lack of rules in IE is really hard for me. But I want to make it work. I do wonder if I am trying to run before I can walk, and right now I should just be allowing myself to binge constantly. Is that what “unconditional permission to eat” means at the start? Do I have to go through that phase to get better? Thank you so much to anyone who answers, and there will probably be more questions coming from me.",1627423499.0

I don't want to starve my body but whenever I do eat, I end up regretting it immediately with diarrhoea and instant sleep as my body uses energy to digest the food. Any advice on handling this?

I'm also 7 weeks on antidepressants and they're starting to produce sparks of serotonin, but I wouldn't think that would be the issue?

I’m thinking, should I stop eating fruits and veg to make up my “five a day” and instead give myself the chance to actually desire them? 

I’d love to hear people’s thoughts on this, and whether this is something others have struggled with too?",1627302039.0

How To Not Shame Spiral When Eating Past Fullness,14,orozor,intuitiveeating,https://shohrehdavoodi.com/overeating-eating-past-fullness/,2,,1627264421.0
One month in and here's what's happening,29,orktit,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/orktit/one_month_in_and_heres_whats_happening/,9," I am 4 weeks into my Intuitive Eating journey today. I thought it would be a good idea to do a health inventory.  


First and most obvious, all eczema breakouts have healed up. I had a huge area in the middle of my back that I had tried everything to heal for 3 years. In one month, it's gone. I didn't use anything on it. I just changed how I eat. The interesting thing is that this month I ate all the food that the doctor told me were causing the breakouts.  


Second, although generally dry skin is quite common where I live, mine was another level dry. I would climb out of the shower, put on lotion immediately to lock in the moisture. An hour later, my skin, particularly on my legs and arms, looked like I had never applied lotion in my life. And it was itchy. Now, I'm no longer itchy, and my skin is able to retain the moisture that the lotion locks in. I do need to put lotion on my hands any time I wash them, but I think that's more or less normal.  


Third, and this is the most amazing thing to me, is that I haven't taken a Tylenol for the last 2 weeks. Before, I had such bad body aches that I had to take some Tylenol an hour before bedtime, and I would still have trouble getting my body comfortable enough to fall asleep. Now, no Tylenol, and according to my smart watch I'm falling asleep earlier and getting an average of 1.5 hours more deep sleep than I was previously. My liver is happy about not getting dosed with Tylenol daily for sure.  


Finally, and sorry for the TMI, after suffering for years with constipation no matter how many prunes I ate, I am amazingly regular now.  


Best of all, zero binges this month. No reason to binge, because no food is off limits. So I've wanted ice cream, and I've eaten ice cream. But I haven't binged on ice cream. It's food sanity, the first time for me in a long time.  


If I were to guess about foods that I ate more of this month than usual, I would say nuts. I ate a LOT of nuts. It's possible that there are some nutrients or oils in the nuts that contributed to these health changes. I don't know, but I did enjoy the nuts!  


I was supposed to add some gentle weight training this month, but I didn't. I'm glad, because it provided some space for me to note that the night time muscle soreness was easing. But this month I really want to start doing it. My DEXA shows that my bones are thinning, so weight training it is.",1627249755.0

I've had the epiphany!! (TW: ed talk and calories),60,oqlyxl,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/oqlyxl/ive_had_the_epiphany_tw_ed_talk_and_calories/,10,"Hey there! So at the beginning of Covid and all the bullshit that came with it, I developed anorexia which I suspect came about due to anxiety and a lack of sense of purpose (job closures, college closures etc)

I became quite underweight but because I had kind of ""hacked"" the weight loss system and had unlimited time to focus on only losing weight, it was so so easy to continue losing weight

Around this time last year I had a major, painful binge which *sort of* made me realise I had taken it too far, so, I picked up the IE book and gave it a read and tried to recover via the all in route

Even though my body wanted to gain weight, my disordered mind still didn't want to, and I continued to try to limit weight gain and I never really started proper recovery, and I eound up underweight again

BUT in the last few months I started a work experience programme for college and I got a placement in a production kitchen which was extremely physically demanding. I realised I was slowing things down. I'm a 21 year old male and I was slowing things down in the physical parts of a job. This shouldnt be the case, I should be intense, energetic and ready for anything

So, I started to increase my calorie intake from 2600, to 3200, then eventually 4000 per day in order to start gaining some weight. However this week I had THE EPIPHANY

If my mind and body are finally on the same page, and both of them know I need to gain weight, and I now WANT to gain weight to be able to keep up with the middle aged people I work with, why am I still tracking calories???

Like, I'm eating in a surplus ANYWAY, I might as well just trust my cues, you know?
Honestly I just want to eat fruit and rest. I feel that would be more pleasant than slamming down tablespoons of peanut butter while trying to do cardio on top of working. Its too hot outside to have fun

TLDR; real life is kicking my fucking ass and I need more food and rest

I don’t feel crazy for wanting to eat bread when my body wants it, or eating butter, or meat, or all the things that people seem to hate nowadays. I’ve been unconsciously practicing intuitive eating for a few months, getting what I feel and not planning anything out (when I do I literally don’t eat the thing). 

To speak on the meat thing, I really feel like my body will feel better if I reintroduce it back into my diet on a normal basis. I live wit a vegetarian, and can’t cook it here because the smell makes her nauseous but I have been mostly vegetarian for 6 years. 

I’m really feeling meat - pork, beef, fish, sausages, chicken here or there just a few more times a month cooked at home will do wonders for me. Rounding out with beans, eggs, greens and creating savory meals is my goal for this fall/winter when I move out. I’m so excited. And just cooking more simple, whole meals will be great. 

The people I live with are so routine in what they eat and idk, I feel judged / self conscious about what I do because, well, they literally were telling me how bad sugar is and that I eat so much butter, even though butter helps me feel more stable.

Struggle between IE and autopilot eating and the desire to lose weight,9,opcnom,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/opcnom/struggle_between_ie_and_autopilot_eating_and_the/,21,"I started my IE journey in March 2020 after I binged after “failing” at the keto diet. I realized then that dieting was doing me more harm than good and read the IE book as well as Anti-Diet and started to adopt the principles. 

I did very well with rejecting the diet mentality and accepting my body at the size it was at. I had stopped binging and didn’t feel guilt no matter what I ate. I got pregnant in June 2020 and continued with IE and used the principles to help me cope with a changing body and weight gain as well as doing my best to listen to my body so that I could give myself and my baby what we needed. 

After I had the baby, I was shocked at how my body had changed. I gained a ton more weight than the “recommended amount” and was heartbroken despite reminding myself that this weight guideline isn’t a one size fits all and that I probably gained it because my body and baby needed it. I ended up blaming IE for “making me fat” and tossed it aside and tried Noom. 

Of course, after a few weeks of starting Noom, I had a really bad binge that made me question what I was doing. It was further confirmation that the premise behind IE and the science behind the effects of dieting are actually correct. What I realized is that the IE I had adopted was autopilot eating and not listening to my body. I never mastered honoring my hunger and fullness and gentle nutrition. Because of this, I believe my body became larger than it’s comfortable with. My joints hurt and it’s really affected my movement. 

So, here are my questions.

1. I still feel like I need to lose weight. My joints hurt and it’s hard for me to do some things because of my new size. My wedding rings also don’t fit and I refuse to resize them. I’m so scared that I’ll do this and then will have to resize them again if I do lose weight. How do I get rid of the intentional weight loss mentality when I feel so uncomfortable at this size?

2. How do I get past this plate cleaning mentality? It’s especially hard when I know I can’t have the food again. For example, if I eat at a restaurant and I know the food won’t be good leftover

3. How do I incorporate gentle nutrition without thinking of it like a diet?",1626956246.0

That may be he case for them, but it’s really hard for people who previously had EDs to be constantly bombarded with weight loss advertisements.

So I'm new to this community, however I've been eating intuitively for a while now. In the past I've struggled with ED, and while it can pop up every now and then (ironically, usually when I'm intuitively eating less), it's always just a passing thought and no longer a factor that dictates what, when, or how much I eat. I feel consistently that ALL food is good food, unless it's spoiled or poisoned, lol. I am so, ***so*** proud of myself for the progress I've made!

>Anyway, thanks for reading that backstory, here's my actual question!  
>  
>I'm wondering if any of you folks have any experience with/thoughts on setting fitness goals? Specifically I'm talking about weight lifting, but this could apply to any fitness program that incorporates goals. I'm feeling like it's something I want to do to love my body better, but the culture surrounding weight lifting is so funny about food, and I'm just simply not going to count macros or download a calorie counter. I really don't have any experience with approaching fitness like this, because (thankfully) it wasn't really something I ever abused when I was struggling with my body image. I'm hoping that someone might have some good advice or experience on how to be able to work towards a fitness goal without undoing the massive progress I've made. I think it could be really easy to slip into a mindset where I could convince myself that I'm eating intuitively, but be subconsciously influenced by the food rules that are so pervasive in that culture.  
>  
>As a side note, the reason I feel that weight lifting is something I want to do as an expression of love for my body, is that I work a very physical job and currently, my body feels worn out and tired at the end of each day. I enjoy the feeling of being strong and being able to lift heavy things, and I also enjoy the feeling of setting goals for myself and achieving them. It's not a primarily aesthetic motivation, but I would definitely say I also like the idea of looking strong, and I think that's why I'm a little nervous about being influenced. But I am definitely not motivated by weight loss (again, yay!! so proud of myself lol), so I'm hoping that that means I could approach this in a healthy way.

Hello everybody! :)

Honestly this needs to stop, i’ve had enough. I am currently in the process of kicking some old habits (yay for being on my tenth day without cigs!) and have been trying to avoid confrontation with one of my worst vices: my relationship with food. I have struggled with an ed in the past and recovered on my own, however, some unintentional weightloss and the pandemic have made me relapse, hard. I have worked on myself and am now in quasi recovery. I eat a sustainable amount of food and am less scared about certain food groups, more flexible about eating out etc. However, it’s the calorie counting that’s ruining it all for me. I have a fixed number that my brain is telling me I should not go over or under, I have no hunger or satiety cues and plan all my eating on how many calories I have “left” ( as if i’m a bloody machine). This needs to stop now. I want to enjoy food again, try new foods, become spontaneous again, not constantly think about food anymore, live life like my fellow uni peers, really enjoy my youth and live my most authentic life, for myself and as a positive influence for my baby niece. 
I am posting this to hold myself accountable. I have had a horrible day eating wise, going a bit over my calorie “limit” and subsequently feeling guilty, which made me realize how stupid this all is. So starting from now on, I will stop counting calories and eating at set times (another ed rule that is hard to get rid off), trying to eat when my body is signaling me to (now mostly listening to mental hunger since my physical hunger has yet to make an appearance)! I just wanted to share this and maybe ask for any tips
or advice, I know that a lot of people on this sub seem
to have gone through something similar. Thank you for reading this, I hope you are staying as happy
and healthy as possible :)

I allowed myself to eat most of a jar of Nutella today, which I feel a bit guilty about.

Ok obviously not food but my eating disorder. I honestly can’t do this anymore. I’ve been stuck on this horrible loop for years that if I try to recover I gain weight, when I gain weight I want to kill myself. Then when I’m losing weight (dieting, counting calories) I’m miserable and want to kill myself. I’m the heaviest I’ve been in a long time and I just can’t take it - but I also cry to myself literally begging myself to not starve myself again. I’ve been starving myself since I was a kid and I just can’t do it anymore. 

And yes, I’ve been in treatment, I have been in therapy for 10 years, am on medication and am not underweight (haven’t been for a good while now). I just don’t know what else I can do

Is this the right choice for me?,6,onatyq,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/onatyq/is_this_the_right_choice_for_me/,8,"I like the idea of intuitive eating,  but sometimes I do encounter fears about whether it's right for me or not. 

This post is going to be long. 

I started to fear becoming fat when I was way too young - around 9 years of age. The reason was probably the fact that my family was comparing me to my sister who is completely different body type than I am and looking back to it now, trying to be more like her for such a long time was anything but praise worthy. 
My mom was a permanent dieter, though now it seems to me that she has wasted too much time depriving herself form the basic joys in life,  all just to stay chubby by her own terms. 

Puberty was kind on me because I grew quite a lot and almost all the baby fat was gone - except for my butt, which was always a bit bigger, but I didn't mind that. 

I lost my best friend in college,  the day after that I was dumped by my boyfriend at the time and that's when I started to think I should lose some serious weight because my one and only strong card was being super skinny. I became anorexic and lost my period for a year.
I fainted once and got seriously scared about my health. Once when I started eating,  I couldn't stop.
My period was back, but my self-confidence was almost non-existent.

I was binging and starving myself intermittently,  and then one day, I was done with that. I decided it was time to seek help. 
The guy who was,  allegedly, an expert was actually a sad father of a deceased girl, who died after years of combating anorexia. Though his heart was good, he did some harm to me by instantly making a comment about me not being skinny at all. I never saw him again,  ditched the dieting and miraculously stopped gaining more weight!
Soon, I lost some weight again,  but whether that was my first non-consicous attempt to give intuitive eating a try, or was it more me starting to smoke,  or just having generally more fun in life,  I cannot tell for sure.

Years later,  in my 30s, I became pregnant with my daughter. I never got back to my pre-pregnancy weight, which I really wanted to, so I have been attempting to diet for the last 3 years.
I really want to be done with all that diet shit forever,  but I am not sure intuitive eating is for me.  Mostly because for the last couple of years,  I  wasn't really successful at dieting. Like, it's not that I was refraining from ""bad foods"" for longer than a few days or like a week in a row.
I am terrified of gaining weight and I am not as nearly as thin now as I used to be.
I  want to quit dieting,  but I feel like the majority of you here are coming from the ""too skinny"" and ""very restricted meals"" place.
I am not.
My last attempt to diet was intermittent fasting with sweets only on weekends. That's not too bad, I wasn't hungry,  and I still feel like I will lose control with this intuitive eating approach.

Can “food rules” be ok in IE?,13,on0txi,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/on0txi/can_food_rules_be_ok_in_ie/,21,"I have been trying intuitive eating due to a history of anorexia. Meal plans never felt sustainable to me because I feel like I’m fighting my body if I eat when I’m not hungry just because it’s time for a snack. But, with IE, I struggle the most with when to stop eating at night. If I go to bed feeling a little hungry, usually I don’t mind but occasionally it results in 3am hunger pangs that are just miserable, and I don’t like having to get up to eat. Therefore if I feel hung  try before bed, I’m afraid of this happening and I’ll overeat even if it’s just a snack. If I go to bed feeling full, I’m really physically uncomfortable. I never seem to find a middle ground where I’m satisfied and neither hungry nor full before bed.

There’s definitely a psychological component where I’m not in touch with my hunger cues in the evening, and it seems like the work-around is to have a cutoff time, i.e. no food for 2 hours before bedtime.

Is this reasonable? Has this worked for anyone? I do find that if I do this and have eaten adequately during the day, then I can fall asleep despite any sense of hunger and it doesn’t wake me up at night, and I’m the right level of hungry in the morning so I can eat breakfast.",1626646846.0

Last night I made a big bowl of ramen (veggie ramen with tempeh, kimchi, peas, spinach, peanuts and a fried egg- so good). I didn’t have any plans to moderate, but to finish my bowl like I usually do (I’m a clean plater). Halfway through, I felt full. I wasn’t trying to eat so slowly that I tricked myself into BELIEVING I was full- I was ACTUALLY. FULL. The thought of eating more was ABSURD.
I could almost hear the angels sing, y’all. It was a magical moment. 
Today at work, we had movie day (I’m a behavioral therapist for autistic kids) complete with lots of popcorn and candy. The last time I had a movie night with those (usually forbidden) foods, I ate so much and never felt full, then felt absolutely awful. This time, I DIDNT FINISH MY FOOD AGAIN, and it wasn’t forced or a big deal. I just straight up felt like I didn’t want anymore, so I gave my plate away.
Knowing this is possible is amazing. The past few months of allowing all foods have been extremely difficult and emotional (but also awesome). I have eaten past my comfort level on so many occasions because my body hadn’t started producing satiety hormones again. It’s incredible to feel these cues, and to honor them.

I can emotionally eat almost anything and don’t tend to stress eat chips, cookies, etc so the “think of a boring food, if you wouldn’t eat it you’re not hungry” trick doesn’t work for me. “De-stress and then see if you’re hungry” also doesn’t work bc I am very bad at de-stressing despite years of therapy (#cptsd lifestyle ftw).

So the past few days I usually only eat when I’m hungry or when my body craves a certain item (so since I work at a general store that have all types of junk food and fasting and dieting made me restrict almost everything in that store so when I see a candy or chips that I haven’t eaten in months I do eat it but it’s never a binge) today I was super stressed tho and I ended up not eating at my break today bc #1 I was not hungry. I’m pretty sure all the anxiety and stress I was feeling turned off my hunger cues and 2. I was scared I was gonna binge eat and I just sat in my car and listened to music until I came back inside but I was still anxious af so I did decide to eat a king size candy bar and the taste was so satisfying but work was still stressing me out but I didn’t want to eat again so I grabbed a bai drink bc it was good and low in calories and drinks take me longer to finish instead of eating chips and candy bars. Idk like I feel like when I’m so stressed like this I think opting for a sweet drink instead of candy or cookies would help me bc I could take small sips through out the day?

This research project aims to develop a motives for binge eating scale. This study is also exploring factors that may increase the risk of binge eating. Specifically, this study examines the relationships between negative childhood experiences (e.g., emotional abuse or invalidation), shame, self-compassion, and motives for binge eating. It is hoped that the results of this research will inform preventative and treatment strategies for individuals experiencing binge eating. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participation in this survey is voluntary, no identifiable information will be collected, and all responses will remain anonymous, except for those participants who choose to provide their contact details at the end of the survey for the purpose of follow-up interviews, in which case information will remain private and only accessible to the student investigator, co-investigator, and principal investigator.

a reoccurring theme in my intuitive eating journey is that i want to eat foods that sound ""delicious."" i will be so hungry but nothing will sound good. i then wind up not eating for awhile and then ordering takeout and eating too much of food that just doesn't make my body feel amazing.

my coach has constantly encouraged breakfast for dinner as it is easy to make and can be filling and satisfying. i am not a big breakfast after 10 AM girl (unless it's brunch and there is a mimosa involved), so i always dismissed that idea.

i had a late day of meetings and appointments on monday and just didn't want to cook dinner. i also desperately needed to get groceries. i finally just decided that i needed to eat and simply didn't want to order takeout because i always order from the same places. for some reason i just said ""f it, I'm going to make breakfast."" i made THE BEST freaking cinnamon brown sugar pancakes, cauliflower and sweet potato tater tots, and some eggs. it was delicious and filled me up. i felt so satisfied and then i didn't even crave something sweet like i usually do after i get a hearty take out meal that also leaves me sickly full. i even planned out the rest of the week's meals because i just felt so excited and so accomplished.  felt like a win to me :)",1626301334.0

So many foods have become less special and ""exciting"", in that I've got biscuits, crisps, brownies, etc on my shelves for over a month! I'm a university student so I'm trying to budget my groceries and not overspend, which is why I make a 2 week meal plan every fortnight. I usually tend to stick to it, editing it every now and then since I treat them more as guidelines (besides the evening meal which I need to write down the ingredients I need in advance.)

I want to try and ditch the meal plan though, and start listening to my intuition but I don't know how. Going off the meal plan and not knowing what I'll have today, tomorrow, etc for dinner in advance scares me, since I feel like I'll overspend on so much during my weekly grocery shop. I was thinking maybe having a list of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and then I can make sure I have the common/general ingredients for them all in stock at all times? I'm not really sure how to go about this. I look after myself and cook for myself, and I adore cooking and trying new things. 

When I put something new on my meal plan like a Spanish Omelette or Greek Pasta Salad for lunch, or a Lasagna for dinner, I get giddy with excitement since I've never made them before.

Tips for overeating,8,ok0ba3,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/ok0ba3/tips_for_overeating/,8,"Hello, I'm new here and looking for some advice.
So, I've recently (finally) decided to stop dieting and make peace with food and my body. 
It's been great, except for one thing. 

I'm very frequently overeating on stuff, way past the point of fullness. 

It has been kind of problem of mine for some time, but I thought it was because I was restricting so much that my body and mind were just super hungry! 
But this is not the case anymore. I'm truly eating enough and well, but if I'm put in front of something that I like, I'll just eat it all, with no regards to hunger cues or anything. 

This is in turn makes me bloated and upsets my stomach a lot. I feel good in the moment, because yum! the food is good, but then when I'm finished I feel really sick. 

This happens frequently. Every Sunday when I'm having lunch (with lots of dessert lying around) with my family, and a couple of times during the week, especially at dinner, I just start eating bread, or potatoes, and... I don't stop. And then I feel awful and sleep awfully and wake up nauseous. 

Do you have any tips on how can I work with this?",1626252700.0

I work in healthcare and have VERY busy 12 hour shifts with 3 half hour breaks (break times start at 10, 1030,11 and so on throughought the day, we don’t choose our breaks we are assigned) 

I am finding it hard to do IE because I cannot honour my cravings nor can I honour my hunger. On my first break I am not usually hungry at 10am but I know if I don’t eat I’ll be so starving and won’t be able to eat again until 1pm. (It’s not an option for me to snack during non break) so I know this isn’t really intuitive it’s scheduled structured and I eat the healthy meals I prepare for myself at work. When I come home I am usually starving and eat a dinner of leftovers because I’m too tired or broke to cook or order out to honour any cravings. The only meal a day thats “intuitive” on work days is my breakfast which even then I have to set rules around addequate amount / substance (I can’t eat cookies for breakfast even on a craving because I’ll be starving in an hour and tired after the sugar crash)

Sugar Free Products and Intuitive Eating?,12,oi22ra,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/oi22ra/sugar_free_products_and_intuitive_eating/,15,"Hey Y'all!

First post, so work with me on the tags. I tried my best. Not used to so many rules for posts, but totally understand why they are there. Thanks mods!

Anyways, I've worked through most of my food rules, and tried a ton of different foods. For some context, my mother is a type 1 diabetic, so I grew up eating a lot of sugar substitute for everything - pancake syrup, diet sodas, no sugar baked goods, etc. It was also the 90s, so everything was also low fat. Which is to say - my diet before an eating disorder consisted of ""diet-y"" things. But the motivation for these foods wasn't really weight loss for me. It was convenience (eat what the family is eating), taste (I find full fat foods to linger too long? Like....pizza burps?), and also a little gentle nutrition (if I add sugar to my food I get a blood sugar spike and get sleepy, I have soft teeth and full sugar drinks makes them feel sad). 

I've tried the full sugar and full fat stuff. It doesn't cause me calorie anxiety, and I don't judge it. If it's whats available I will eat it no second thoughts. I also acknowledge that really low fat food leaves me hungry really frequently which is annoying, so I incorporate more fat. I eat things like: nutbutter, cinnamon toast crunch, full bananas, nut pods in coffee (these are pretty equivalent to half in half but my tummy is much happier), ranch dressing, salmon, white rice, white pasta on the reg. I eat real full fat ice cream, fun drinks, and restaurant food when I go out to eat without any guilt. But day to day, I really enjoy stuff like Halo Top, Pb2, Walden Syrup, fat free yogurt, diet soda, stevia in coffee, rice cakes, apple sauce instead of oil in banana bread, etc.

So my question is: is it ok to eat some ""diet-y"" products and foods while eating intuitively if the goal isn't to control calories, but its actually just a thing I enjoy?",1625999275.0

If I don’t think about it I tend to eat a lot of protein, fat, dairy, vegetables things that don’t really support running at those distances but are my normal. 

I’ve never done proper sports nutrition because I was too sick actually I think all the running drove the binging because I refused to eat properly. So now I feel ready to fuel right but that is going to mean eating things I don’t eat. Refined carbohydrates will allow me to consume more because they have less fiber and bulk but they are not my regular diet. It’s an extreme example but In terms of performance a Twinkie is better than kale. It’s the sure fire way to support my running goals and im sure with practice I’ll find I’ll like some of them but there is a flashing red sign in my mind that says sweet potatoes good, bagels bad that I can’t turn off.

This is a ramble but I hope others have experience with opposing goals.",1625870656.0

I feel like things like medication related weight gain that makes life uncomfortable isn't addressed often either.

Hello! I was wondering if other people would be willing to share their journey with negative associations of being smaller/lower weight and positive associations of fatness. 

For excellent and understandable reasons a lot of IE content is focused on unlearning fatphobia and fears of higher weights or being in a larger body. However, some of the things that Susie Orbach talks about regarding fears of being smaller really resonated with me and I want to discuss that in a safe space. I’m really interested in how other people worked through these things.

She talks about the fact that for many people, there is a mental association between thinness and sexualisation. Or about the familial connotations of weight loss, etc. 

For me personally, I have more mental hang ups about losing weight than gaining. I definitely feel more vulnerable to sexualisation when a lower weight (no evidence for this!). I also fear that both being smaller (regardless of health) and health-promoting behaviours (regardless of weight or size) will make people around me less comfortable. I feel I am more approachable and likeable when fatter. 

Just really keen to hear other people’s experiences.

Intermittent Fasting Triggers my ED - Looking for advice,40,obv6nf,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/obv6nf/intermittent_fasting_triggers_my_ed_looking_for/,22,"\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\* - Mentions ED, Intermittent Fasting, Weight Gain

&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

This past summer I took up running, and intermittent fasting, specifically OMAD. To be frank, I lost quite a bit of weight in a short amount of time. However, upon reflection this was the start of an eating disorder that I developed. Once I reached my ""goal weight"", I realized how unsustainable my lifestyle was. I was only eating a single meal once a day, on top of running nearly every day, sometimes even completing a full 36 hour fast. 

Naturally, my body wanted to fight back against such strict restriction, so on some weekends I would binge eat, HARD. Eating all the chocolate, carbs, candy, cereal I could reach. Once I finished to the point of bursting I would get so down on myself for having ""no willpower"" and I would purge, either physically in the toilet, or the next day by not eating, or exercising excessively. This sort of cycle went on for months, up until March of this year where I finally looked myself in the mirror after a particularly excessive binge and recognized that this wasn't healthy nor sustainable for my mental health.

So that's when I stopped purging, and started my IE Journey. 

However, naturally, I gained some of the weight back. The clothes that fit me at my skinniest don't button up anymore. It's been a struggle to say the least, adapting to this new body. I've been trying to look at it as a step in the healthier direction, rather than considering it a failure, or all my hard work losing the weight was for nothing. My body is healing from the damage I've done.

Recently ""Intermittent Fasting"" subreddit popped up on my suggested subreddits, and I scrolled through it. Lots of the posts are people my same height, and reaching my same goal weight. My mind immediately dove into that same pattern of thinking I had last summer. ""That's what you need to do, only one meal a day, it worked for you in the past, you have to get back to where you were ect. ect""

Does anyone understand what I'm going through? I want to fight off these voices but they are powerful. Any advice and support would be appreciated.",1625173401.0

Win after 6 months of IE!,44,obps1h,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/obps1h/win_after_6_months_of_ie/,5,"TRIGGER WARNING: metabolism, metabolic rate, calories, weight


So I started my IE journey in early 2021. I started implementing the various principles. I also took a metabolic test that measures your resting metabolic rate (RMR) at the advice of a dietician family friend. That RMR was 1295, which was super low for my age/build, and indicated how desperately my body needed food. 

Over the last 6 months, I have focused on just giving myself permission to eat what I want. I feel like I have a much better relationship with food after years of dieting/binge eating/restricting. I also started to incorporate weightlifting at home 1-2 a week (not consistent but definitely more movement than what I normally do!). 

Fast forward to June and with the summer starting, I was starting to feel more self-conscious about my body. I felt like I had gone up a size or two, I even unfortunately stepped on a scale (which confirmed my weight gain). I was starting to feel super defeated and frustrated. 

But then…I decided to take another RMR test yesterday, just to see where I was at. My new RMR is now 1598! Huge improvement in my metabolism!!

This is just to say that IE actually improved my health and that I 💅🏽 DID 💅🏽 THAT. I’ve never been more proud of myself than now. I’m still dealing with body image but honestly, the joy in seeing that number go up just felt so validating because there were so many points in the last 6 months where I was really doubting the process and doubting myself. 

To those struggling, keep pushing! This stuff works!!!",1625157879.0

I am wondering how I can best support him while still maintaining the principles of IE. 

This is a very sensitive topic for him as he is not someone who grew up with access to healthcare and gets very nervous around doctors and anything medical. 

Any advice or suggestions are welcome. I am particularly interested in thoughts from folks who have type 2 diabetes and would be willing to offer insight into what kind of support would be helpful from a partner based on their own experience.

"Trouble figuring out how to eat intuitively tw: disordered eating, weight loss",6,oblo1g,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/oblo1g/trouble_figuring_out_how_to_eat_intuitively_tw/,6,"I’m slowly trying to become an intuitive eater, but am struggling with knowing when to stop eating and when to keep going. I’ve been very conscious of always eating low-cal food since I was about 13 (I’m 22 now) so it’s very hard for me to eat something that I categorized in my head as “bad” without going off the deep end, eating emotionally, and making myself feel sick. 

I also have a sensitive stomach (both my dad and sister are the same way) so there are foods I know will not make me feel good even if I am craving them. I’ve been restrictive in both what I allow myself to eat, and how much I eat, and at this point I’ve lost a sense of how much I actually should be eating, and what I can’t eat (i.e. what actually upsets my stomach) verses what foods I’ve just deemed as “bad” because of their calorie count. 

Yesterday I tried to force myself to eat more because I noticed I had lost some weight which is not healthy for me, I even ordered fried cauliflower bites at a patio which I normally wouldn’t do, but feel so sick today from the amount I ate. I feel like I’m not listening to my body by eating more and by eating “bad” foods because they don’t make my body feel good. I’m not sure how to approach intuitive eating if it’s just going to translate into feeling awful, or eating exactly how I ate before.",1625145512.0
"I (36F) formerly identified myself as a food addict, but have very recently started the journey to intuitive eating as a new path. How do I get my recovering alcoholic boyfriend (40M) to stop judging me for my shift in behavior and be supportive?",24,obda2w,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/obda2w/i_36f_formerly_identified_myself_as_a_food_addict/,19,"(TW because I discuss specific food restriction.)

I spent the last nearly 5 years restricting flour and all forms of sugar from my diet, because I went to a therapy program that had me convinced I was a food addict with binge eating disorder. The program itself was very helpful in teaching me DBT techniques, distress tolerance, mindfulness, etc. and I’m very grateful for those skills. However, while I could live with removing flour and sugar from my diet (that good ol’ all or nothing mentality, eh?!), the bingeing returned at various times. It wasn’t until I started working with a different therapist that I finally realized the bingeing was symptomatic of other things going on in my life (loneliness, boredom, sadness, and most importantly, feeling like I was missing out on delicious food experiences and trying to fill that void with foods I “could” eat and not succeeding), and so I started wondering if I was truly addicted to food or if I just had a damaged relationship that needed a lot of repairing. So I read a lot of articles about IE, listened to a few podcasts, got the book, got about 100 pages in and decided to break up with my former restrictive food plan and start healing my relationship with food through intuitive eating.

Here’s my issue. I started dating my current boyfriend while I was in the beginning stages of my “food addiction recovery,” and at the time he basically had to get used to being with someone who couldn’t “eat like a normal person.” He’s a recovering alcoholic, so he can’t “drink like a normal person” and feels that his addiction qualifies him to make judgments about “mine”. Throughout our relationship, when I was restricting, he would randomly question me about what I was eating, if it’s allowed on my food plan, all with a sort of judgmental tone, as though he felt the need to keep tabs on me. He can’t be blamed for all of it, though; clearly, I am a person who’s been diet obsessed for 25+ years, so much so that it became a part of my identity. He’s seen me have struggles with food and body image and new exercise plans and repeated attempts at keto (all part of the diet culture cycle). So his skepticism isn’t entirely unwarranted, I will admit. However, now that I’m venturing into this new journey, he thinks I’m making a big mistake and says he can’t be 100% supportive. I see his judgey glances at the food choices I’m making, and while I try to share little mental victories I’ve been having (which are monumental to me), I can tell his response is like, “That’s great, but…” He still thinks of me as a fellow addict, and he thinks it’s just my addiction making me take this journey. I have never felt more clear about a food direction and while it already has not been mentally easy, I know there’s a long road of struggles to come and a lot of work to do, and the fact that he’s not being the support I need makes me feel especially vulnerable and sad. I find that I prefer eating alone just to avoid having to pretend I don’t see him glancing at my plate. I just moved to a brand new state less than a year ago to be with him, so I don’t have other people around to spend time with (thanks, pandemic); he’s really the only person I see consistently. And having to be my own 100% support is challenging and lonely. I want to be able to comfortably share meals and periodically indulge together, rather than eat an ice cream bar alone in front of him and know he’s casting a judgmental eye. Btw, he’s someone who’s never had issues with food or eating. He naturally eats intuitively and inherently practices gentle nutrition and joyful movement.

Has anyone else experienced this with their SO? Does it get easier? Is there anything I should or could do or say to help the process along? It’s hard enough getting myself to be okay with eating certain foods again, I worry if I can’t work something out with him, I’m going to resort to secret eating, which is a big red flag for me.

TL;DR My recovering addict boyfriend thinks I, a former self-proclaimed food addict, am making a mistake by learning how to eat intuitively, and has consistently been judgmental of food choices I make, if they’re not in line with a particularly strict food plan. How do I get him to understand what I’m doing so he’ll be supportive of my journey?",1625110285.0

I also didn’t restrict myself on Monday Tuesday or today! Usually after an “unhealthy” weekend I would try to stay under 1500 calories the next week and work out like crazy. I decided to put a stop. 

Today I ate foods that were colourful, fruits and veggies and good proteins. I also had a bit of chocolate after my snack. This is the first night I’m going to bed not feeling hungry, and it’s freaking me out that I’m not upset about it. I’m so happy.

Anyway, I took the merengue into my hotel room and had it with some water. At first it tasted good, like cardamom and cinnamon. Then it turned sugary and I started feeling weird.

I’m almost 9 months into my IE journey and feeling a dip in body confidence. It’s something I’ve been dealing with on and off for about a month and a half. I’m in a particularly weird head space because I feel myself desiring to lose weight and coveting other people’s appearances, however I know I’m not going to take to drastic measures to try and achieve those things. I am still doing my own thing and what works for me with intuitive eating, but I feel these intrusive voices getting louder and louder that are diminishing my self confidence. 

Does anyone have advice for this sort of thing? I have a feeling it will pass but it can be difficult to endure. I go though waves of feeling great in my own skin— the highs feel great but the lows are really getting to me lately.

I fell under a weird rabbit hole last spring where I thought that ""normal"" people ate just a little and exercised a lot. I saw some healthcare professionals as my weight dropped and they didn't diagnose me, but gave me tips on how to gain weight. I no longer think the way I did, so I'm glad I dodged that bullet, but I suspect I'm still undereating.

 I have been trying to eat more intuitively for a couple of months. I am familiar with some podcasts, Abbey Sharp and some books and I have talked with a registered dietitian. I don't have active contact with her, but I have access to a doctor in case we need to reschedule an appointment. I posted here earlier about soups and salads.

I'm not sure which flair to put this under, but as I've been trying to practice IE at home, I haven't been in an unexpected situation with food for a while. I'm going to stay in a bigger town for a couple of days, and on Saturday I'll go hiking to Lapland for about a week. (I'm Finnish)

This will definitely be interesting and I have no ideas on how I will eat, but I plan to carry some snacks with me just in case. I also plan to dry some mock meat and maybe buy some meals for the hiking trip.  (Edit: I'm going with my dad, so he'll have some plans as well. ) I wonder if food journaling would be helpful.

Either way, I'm a bit excited and a bit spooked out. Usually I eat 5-6 Times a day, but the rhythm will most likely be different with bigger meals. At least I won't have the access to a scale for a while.

Cravings versus blood sugar problems,16,o940ca,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/o940ca/cravings_versus_blood_sugar_problems/,24,"Hi friends. I did IE in the past and trying to get back to it. 

I have issues with IE vs managing health issues. Specifically, I'm prone to low blood sugar, which triggers migraines. 

One issue with this is that my blood sugar is steadier when I have higher protein meals. I feel better, can focus for longer, and get less migraines. But I consistently crave carbohydrates. Most carbs I eat are whole foods - beans, whole grains, fruits - which helps reduce blood sugar spikes, but higher protein makes me feel better than higher carbs. 

I am struggling with this because I'm feeling not just my usual carb cravings, but some aversion to high protein foods lately. I think the standard advice would be ""have some proteins and some carbs together"" which is what I'm forcing myself to do. But especially in the morning, I just do not want yogurt, eggs, or whatever. It is actively unpleasant to make myself eat this stuff lately. I just want toast or similar, but then my energy and blood sugar respond poorly.

Since I started, I have definitely been in the “eat everything” phase and have put on weight. I don’t blame myself after 24 years of dieting, and I’m trying not to panic about it. I haven’t weighed myself, but I estimate that it’s about 30 lbs in 3 months. 

I’ve been having all these muscle cramps and I’m wondering if it’s because of my suddenly larger size. The most horrific ones are in my belly - kind of like round ligament pain during pregnancy, but much more painful. Since it’s the same area, I worry that my belly is so big that it’s like I’m pregnant again and it’s stressing my body. It feels muscular, but there’s so much fat that it’s not like I can feel beneath it. It’s really painful and it always happens when I’m like stretching or getting out of a chair. I just had one that hurt so bad it made me feel like I wanted to puke. It’s still sore!

First post, hope I appropriately tagged everything!

So I've been following IE in one form or another since 2013, but have been more intentional with IE since maybe 2019. Things have been up and down regarding IE but I've made a lot of progress. My struggles aren't with binging but with restriction, as I've been up and down the diet train for most of my adolescence. 

I've been on two SSRIs now, Prozac and Lexapro, and got either GI issues or really bad fatigue and nausea so I've had to stop taking both which is a shame, because Prozac at least really helped my anxiety. My psychiatrist prescribed Remeron, which is >!well known for causing weight gain!<, more so than Prozac or Lexapro.

My anxiety has jumped to the point where I almost had a panic attack about the thought of taking it and >!feeling out of control in terms of my body shape!<. Which is internalized fatphobia, I know. But it's hard to disentangle all this and feels like it's more stress than I can handle at once, and that going back to not taking meds may be better. Or at least asking my psychiatrist about changing meds.

The reason I'm thinking about this is because I know what I can handle with regards to IE and anxiety, and I know that if I go at my own pace with IE, it's okay but this throws a big wrench into my progress and I'm afraid I might backslide into restriction >!to prevent the weight gain!< even if it may not happen.

I mean sure I have thoughts about food but it’s unrealistic for me to go out and get everything I think about I just start eating and I get the cue that I’m full but it’s like leaving something on my plate is taboo even though my parents never forced that on me and I have food in my house so nothing is limited which makes it even harder for me to understand why I keep putting myself through this same cycle. I know the food is there I see it so why do I keep eating when I’m full? As far as my hunger I don’t know if I would have such a problem recognizing it as much as I gave waiting for it if that makes sense? I know a lot of people say that thinking if food is a sign of hunger but I don’t think that’s reliable for me because I do get full quickly and easily even if my stomach is growling I guess I just want to rush the feeling so I can eat.

What do you do when dinner turns out bad?,22,o5pl41,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/o5pl41/what_do_you_do_when_dinner_turns_out_bad/,17,"Hi there!

For context, I just found this sub and while I'm technically new to intuitive eating, I'm so happy to have found it because it describes a concept that has been my goal for a long time.

The other night I made fried rice with tofu for dinner, and it came out really bad. Taste-wise it was okay, but texture-wise it was a blob. I don't like eating blobs! But I also don't like feeling as though I've wasted food and for financial reasons I'm trying to cut back on ordering food for delivery. This happens every so often when I try to cook, because I'm still learning. It's really frustrating because I feel like I have to choose between throwing out food (which is uncomfy) and forcing to eat something I don't like (which sucks).

What do y'all do in these situations?

Edit: Have been spending the afternoon reading and thinking about intuitive eating, I realized that in titling this post I used the good/bad language when it's not moral or immoral to cook something that has a weird texture. I'll consider my language use more carefully when going forward and am so excited to be on this journey! ",1624375212.0

Follow Hunger Ques or Cravings?,5,o5p0jg,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/o5p0jg/follow_hunger_ques_or_cravings/,3,Newbie to IE and attempting to transition from intermittent fasting. (Previously suffered from disordered eating 4+ years ago; Intermittent fasting for 1 year). I recently checked out the intuitive eating book (Elyse Resch) from my libary and wanted to give it a try. I have not consulted with any professional or therapist through my entire journey due to young age and low income. I am running into a issue though. I find that its difficult to identify hunger. The frist day I was trying to be incredibly in-tuned to my hunger but it never came... I obviously need to eat and so I find that just scheduling the meals like I previously did in ED recovery works better but I’m concerned it is not in the natural want and need of my body. Any advice for this (hopefully) healthy transition?,1624373715.0
"After 1.5 years of IE, a healed relationship with food and my body, and 1.5 years binge free, I recently had a calorie counting relapse and had one of my worst binges yet today. Looking for some encouragement.",17,o57vq3,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/o57vq3/after_15_years_of_ie_a_healed_relationship_with/,12,"Would love some advice from anyone that gained weight with IE and fell back into dieting again. How did you cope with the weight gain? How did you find your way back to IE? I blamed IE for my weight gain and completely ditched everything I had learned when I reached my current weight after pregnancy, but I don’t know if it’s actually IE that was the issue. I’m just so confused and know that dieting and calorie counting are not going to be the solution. 

Also, I know that intentional weight loss is a taboo topic within IE, but what do we do if our larger size is causing us pain and physical limitations? My joints hurt more than ever before and I hate feeling like I can’t do everyday tasks as easily as I could before. I know that a huge part of IE is loving your body as it is and that we can be healthy at any size, but I do not feel healthy at all.",1624316024.0

Caught an unconscious dietary view: is it *time* to eat yet..?,120,o3dc4y,intuitiveeating,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/o3dc4y/caught_an_unconscious_dietary_view_is_it_time_to/,23,"I am currently reading the book by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch so I am processing the paradigm shift it causes in my views and it is very much ‘top of mind’ at the moment. (Obligatory edit: I’m a newbie!)

Today, this causes me to catch an unconscious ‘dietary’ view I didn’t even realize I had. I didn’t put on a watch today (yay weekend) and as I’m going on about my day, I suddenly feel that I’m beginning to get hungry. 

My FIRST IMPULSE was to check my watch to see what time it is. To check if it is lunch time yet, to check whether my hunger is *legitimate*. I had no idea that it went as deep as this. And it was totally automatic and unconscious, too, so who knows how long I’ve been doing this. ‘Let’s check if my body actually knows what it needs.’ Such a wake-up call. 

By the time I realized this, I decided that I will *not* watch the clock and just eat. This is so liberating.",1624099646.0
