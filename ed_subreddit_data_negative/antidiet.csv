**Is \_\_\_ a diet?**

A diet is any form of food restriction in pursuit of weight loss. This includes CICO, intermittent fasting, OMAD, keto, Weight Watchers, Paleo, Atkins, Whole Foods Plant Based, portion control, any diet you that you yourself made up with your own rules, etc.

**But it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle**

If one's eating habits are generally guided by external rules (points, macros, calories, etc) and restrictions (no carbs, no sugar, low fat, etc) for the sake of weight loss, it's a diet.

[Excellent blog posts that sums up how ""lifestyle changes"" are often diets in disguise.](https://www.thereallife-rd.com/2017/10/diet-culture/)

**What about diabetes, celiac, food allergies, etc?**

This is against weight loss diets, and keeping yourself alive isn't a weight loss diet.

**But being fat is unhealthy. Do you want everyone to die?**

Diets aren't sustainable and often lead to even more weight gain long term. Check out the links below. And while not every size is healthy, health cannot be determined by size alone. People of every size can try to improve their health within the bodies they currently inhabit.

Noom is beyond stupid,99,stgsf2,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/stgsf2/noom_is_beyond_stupid/,32,"I saw a bunch of posts on here commenting on how bad this app was, so I decided to see for myself.

The entire Noom ""method"" of weight loss is based on a concept called ""volume eating"" which has been thoroughly debunked and has no basis in reality.

The theory goes that if you eat a high volume of food thet contains a low amount of calories, you will feel full even though you are eating less calories.

The human body is not this stupid. If you eat 1 lb of broccoli you will be hungry again in 15 minutes. Try it. If this worked, everyone would just replace steak with broccoli and we would all be thin or dead from malnourishment. But somehow we don't see that happening. Shocker.

Noom divides foods into good and bad based on how much water is in the food instead of calories. Because according to them, you can make yourself feel full on water. You can't make this up. It's like reading some kind of magic crystals pseudosciencey weirdness.

It's just so sad that Noom traffics in yet another way to promise people that they have an easy way to change their bodies when this simply isn't the case. Again, if you could just replace food with water, there wouldn't be any people struggling with weight. And they wouldn't need a Noom app to help them do that anyways.

Ok rant over.

Update: I wanted to add 1 more thing: From a business standpoint, it is actually better for Noom that their method *doesn't* work, and here's why:  The better/faster it works, the sooner people will cancel their paid membership. It's very similar to dating apps. The sooner you find a partner, the less money they make by you paying to use the app. So it is not ridiculous to assume that this is done on purpose by Noom. Sickening.

Update #2: One more one more thing. lol. The other big concept that Noom absolutely drills into you through their ""educational content"" is the concept of blind faith. Yes you heard right, just beleiving. Because that's how science and biology works, right guys? This is classic cult mentality. Tell people to ""just beleive"" and if it doesn't work, then simply blame them for ""not beleiving hard enough"".",1644968080.0

I’ve been intuitive eating and anti diet for about 2 years now since my ED recovery and am slowly dipping my toes back into movement. I’ve found things I genuinely enjoy, like bike riding and occasional walks. I genuinely feel better when I move more through things I enjoy that are not punishment. 

My partner and I are going on a vacation in a couple months and we are planning on hiking a lot. I’m very excited because I generally feel better spending time outdoors, but I’m a little nervous about how long I’ll be able to walk. 

I want to try to improve my cardio abilities and just generally feel less tired by things like hiking or walking (and minimizing back pain), but I’ve never done this from an anti diet lens. I’m worried of falling into old habits again. 

I’m wondering if anyone has had experience in improving their fitness without a focus on weight changes or a regimented routine? How did you approach this from a non diet perspective?",1644816945.0

Oh, your mental health is in such a state that you can't eat -- well, at least you lost weight! Look on the bright side!

So when my partner said that, I felt instantly ashamed, and defensive, and sad.

We’ve done a lot of great work in my house around listening to our bodies, silencing any praise or shame around body size and shape, and not restricting food for weight loss.

My aunt is coming to stay with me. She’s wonderful! I love her very much. She has cared about her weight her whole life, and has told me she’s on a new restrictive diet.

She sent before and after pictures, she’s talking about how she hopes she can reach her “goal weight.” At Christmas, she refused to even try one of the cookies we spent all day making, that I know she loves, and instead she ate a weird keto bar

How do I tell her that if she wants to diet, that’s her decision, but talking about her body and restrictions is not welcome here?

I feel like I don't have anyone I can really talk to about my body issues and struggles with dieting, mainly because I'd like to speak to plus size people since I've recently become plus size and though I do have amazingly beautiful plus size friends I don't want to trauma dump them with my body issues and insecurities. I don't want to trigger them into feeling bad about themselves because I'm feeling bad about myself, you know? (Like how someone who is skinnier than you says they need to lose weight - not that I am skinnier than them but either way.. don't want them to feel that way). I do talk about antidiet with my friends and they are pro anti diet but I don't talk about the things I'm personally struggling with in the moment. 

My boyfriend does support me in antidiet and he does 'get it' but he doesn't 'get it' get it. What he gets is that when we first got together I was often skipping meals and replacing it with coffee and I was always tired and low energy and now that I eat often and enough I have energy to walk places and do things and workout. But I feel he doesn't really understand anti-diet and the research behind it. He's super into YouTube bodybuilding and he believes in calories in calories out for weight determination, macros, eating protein, going on cuts etc. Recently he's been feeling unhappy with his body since he got more of a gut since moving in with me and lockdown and he is wanting to go on a calorie deficit. I always tell him that I think he's hot and attractive and all that good stuff but in the end it is his decision whether or not to diet so I support him in what he wants to do but it does make me worry and wonder about myself.

My mum on the other hand ""supports"" IE and antidiet but honestly she's still dieting and has disordered eating herself and plays it off as IE. She say that she doesn't diet but she restricts her calories, has days where she replaces meals with optifast/isowhey, says things like ""I was going to have an ice-cream but talked myself out of it"", says she's ""been bad"" or when we have an ice-cream says it's naughty. If I say I've been struggling with my weight gain and body image she's right there to jump in and say that she's been gaining weight and how she doesn't like how she looks. I love with my mum so I often have interactions like these.

I've been constantly second guessing myself. All the time I'll look up some health thing online and without fail its ""lose weight"", and I'll see pictures of myself before and feel unhappy about my body now. It impacts me when I am watching media - I love Doja cat but now everytime I see pictures/videos of her I feel insecure about my weight and want to diet again. I always have to tell myself that dieting won't make me happy, that I was so tired, that I'll probably fail and gain more weight to stop myself.

I kinda blurted out today about how I get worried about his lack of self compassion and his relationship to food/exercise and how it also is just hard for me to hear these things and not have it mess with my head while I’m on my journey. I feel guilty about sorta imposing my worries on him (it’s not like my job to psychoanalyze him) but also it does obviously affect me. 

So I guess my question is if anyone has been in a similar situation and how I can reopen this discussion in a way that’s productive (today was not. He basically just shut down and then told me doesn’t understand what is “healthy”)",1643086101.0
Being a bride is making this hard! Tips?,6,sc7eo9,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/sc7eo9/being_a_bride_is_making_this_hard_tips/,8,"Hey lovely people! 

I am newer to anti-diet and have been going strong for a bit now but just before Covid, I developed fibromyalgia and I found out I have a genetic heart issue and was told I can never lift again …

Being hella strong in ways I could show off in competitions is how I moved my focus and found grace around my “fatal flaws” which allowed me to focus less on what I was eating and enjoy what my body was doing. 

Now that I can’t lift or compete, I feel like I am focused more on my body and want to slip back into things like raw till 4 or fruit until noon.

ANY steps away from dieting are worthwhile,80,s73q5c,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/s73q5c/any_steps_away_from_dieting_are_worthwhile/,4,"We've recently had a lot of posts here about, ""I'm still bought in to XYZ aspects of diet culture, is that okay?""

My thought is that first of all, yes, it's okay — any level of engagement of diet culture is 'okay' in the sense that there's no moral value to dieting or not dieting. This sub exists as a place for people who don't partake in diet culture to exchange ideas and experiences, but that doesn't mean the antidiet path is necessarily the right one for everybody at every time in their lives. Why should one path be right for everybody at all times? That has probably never happened.

Second, I personally think it's a totally legitimate use of the space to expose one's self to a different perspective, without necessarily giving up one's old ideas. With all the diet stuff out there on the internet, maybe you're just curious what a different way could look like, and that's great. As long as you read and follow the sub's rules, you're welcome here.

Finally, I also think that *any* steps away from diet culture are positive and worthwhile. If what you get out of lurking here is that you keep dieting, but do it in a nicer way with more positive self-talk, that's a win as far as I'm concerned. Same with if you loosen up your calorie restrictions even a little, or allow yourself ""treat"" foods more often, or pay more attention to the parts of you that are valuable that have nothing to do with your body size — all of that is a win. You don't have to take it all the way to antidiet, and you don't have to do everything all at once, either.

So if you're considering even a tiny step towards gentler nutrition, towards kinder self-talk, or towards letting go of a little bit of control...do it. Don't look back! And if those steps are the only ones you want to take, then that's fine, too. You can always do more later, if you want to. Or not. It's up to you.",1642529292.0

 I went to a small birthday party yesterday. My friends are generally very positive people who would never comment on my weight and who are nice all around. But yesterday one friend who I'm not that close to was very drunk/high (I have no clue what she took) and started acting mean towards everyone. Among other awful things, she told me that I needed to lose weight and that if I tried I could do it. I tried to politely tell her to stop because I didn't want to lose weight and I've had eating disorders in the past so this was very triggering. She acted like she didn't hear me and kept going, even told me ""I understand because I'm also a bit fat, even though not as much as you"". 

Everyone was angry at her at this point, since she literally insulted everyone there, so she got kicked out soon after. What was very reassuring is that after she left I told the others what she said to me and they were all incredibly supportive. One of my friends was horrified and sat with me for a long time telling me to please not listen to her and that it was unacceptable that she would talk to me like that. Today a few people have checked on me to ask me how I'm doing.

I feel guilty that I didn't stand up to her. It caught me completely off guard and I was hurt that someone, even if not a close friend, would come to me at a party to tell me to lose weight. I decided today that even if the others eventually forgive her I don't want to see her again. I don't want to be friends with someone so negative about my weight, I don't care how drunk she was. Ultimately I think it was an act of self sabotage on her side, but I'm not here for it. So while this was an awful experience, I do feel happy that I can recognize her behavior and that my other friends were supportive.",1642354520.0

Ads Suck but Especially in January,57,s33zvv,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/s33zvv/ads_suck_but_especially_in_january/,13,"I wrote this for an ED subreddit I’m a part of, but I notice there’s a lot of frustration with diet ads in this sub as well, so I thought I could share some strategies I have.

Welcome to your new year's resolution 2022, which is to do your best to ignore everyone else's 2022 new year's resolutions. Because you can't stick your fingers in your ears and sing ""LA LA LA LA LA"" at the top of your voice to make ads on the internet go away, here are my favorites for blocking the worst of the internet.

Get a browser that supports extensions or add-ons. Most of the major ones do. I recommend Firefox. To find any of these extensions I'm mentioning, google ""<Browser you use> extension <extension-name>"". Go to the page in either the Chrome store or Firefox Add-on store and add it to your browser. Here are the extensions I recommend:

- Adblock Plus: blocks pop-ups and Youtube ads.
- Privacy Badger: blocks invisible trackers, like cookies that will follow you around.
- SponsorBlock for YouTube: skips embedded sponsorships on Youtube videos. Not perfect, has a little GUI for submitting times for others to skip ads within videos if you're the first person to watch with the extension.
- uBlock Origin: another ad-blocker. I think this one hides Pinterest ads, if I'm remembering right.

Once you've installed them, they'll line up in the right-hand corner of your browser. Some sites might not work properly when you have so many ad-blockers, so I'll leave the icons up there so I can turn them all off if a site doesn't load, or a form doesn't submit properly. If all those little icons bother you, you can right-click and select ""Remove from Toolbar"" and it'll go into your hamburger button area. 

Mobile's a little funkier, and depends on whether you're on iOS or Android. For iOS there are some ad-blockers on the app store, although I can't speak to any of them. I use something from the [Privacy Guides recommended mobile list](https://privacyguides.org/browsers/#mobile-only-recommendations) personally. I still get Reddit ads, unfortunately. Sometimes I browse old.reddit.com just to avoid them even though the mobile experience blows.

Need to just NOT EVER VISIT A WEBSITE? Or just not visit it quite so much? I've used [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) in the past to block harmful sites or to set up timers to block social media sites. Here are some [Windows alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/selfcontrol/?platform=windows). In iOS you can use [ScreenTime](https://www.familyorbit.com/blog/block-websites-on-iphone/) to block sites. I believe Android Digital Wellbeing is the equivalent to this.

If you're looking to block ads on smart tvs and other devices, I recommend [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). This is hard mode, but if you like tinkering with technology like raspberry-pis, servers, and home automation, this might be up your alley. I used [this guy's tutorial](https://www.itchy.nl/raspberry-pi-4-with-openvpn-pihole-dnscrypt/). Complicated, but then everyone on your internet gets some good ol'adblocking action.

I’ve known this whole time I’m most likely consider ob$&;! but I’ve decided to stop weighing myself in an effort to support my mental health.

But I’ve been working really hard to be kind to myself and my body throughout this process even though it’s not doing what I want it to 🙄 I was sharing with my therapist (who I’ve loved and relied on for over a year) that I was scared that when we finally get to see a fertility specialist they will just tell me to lose weight. She asked me why that would be a problem and I shared with her a little overview of my unhealthy relationship with dieting, HAES and IE. She then says “I am all for intuitive eating and body positivity but if they ask you to lose weight it will just be about your likelihood to conceive. Don’t you think you could do weight loss just to have a baby and then go back to intuitive eating after?” I felt so blamed for the fact that I’ve been unable to get pregnant. I just said I’d think about it and we ended our session. Please let there be someone here who can give me a pep talk 😭 I don’t want to diet again but if I felt that much pressure from her I can only imagine how hard it would be to advocate for myself with a fertility specialist. 😞

Edit:
I just want to add that I came to seek out the HAES and IE community on Reddit because of the supportive community I found in dealing with infertility on some other subreddits.

I'm going to try posting here instead. All of my life I've been on the bigger side, when I was in elementary school I suffered day in and day out from countless comments on my body. Even though I was subjected to body shaming early on in life I never truly understood. In middle school I wanted to be thin, I wanted to be like my friends and even back in elementary school I demonized my friends weight and always tried to at least be the second biggest, because god forbid I was the biggest in the room. In high school I started to get attention from boys, but not in the way I wanted. I was made fun of and taunted and called slurs for having my hair short. It was something that made me feel heavy dysmorphia in a different way then now. I imagined myself as thin, would always compare to the somewhat bigger (but smaller than me) girls in my class. This was until I was cheated on. I think that nailed the coffin. I started weight loss researching. I went vegan and I became obsessed. Not to mention in late middle school early high school I was subjected to my friend with an eating disorder. I wanted so badly to be her, I'd do very dangerous things and it has only carried with me into my adult life. I lost quite a bit of weight, however I am still deemed overweight by my doctors. I have never been told to lose weight, but I've seen it on the description of my profile after a visit. I am fully vegan, I have tried many many things. However I have struggled with depression and undiagnosed bpd from early on in my life, about age 12. It's a struggle every day to just exist. And I was perma banned from the bpd subreddit. It was because I evaded a ban in an episode. And because I was trying to be honest and vulnerable with the mods I I myself kicked out of that circle. It was devastating. I have no therapist at the moment and I do think I used the sub maybe a bit too much to just vent. I didn't mean to trigger anyone but I have nothing else I really relate to. (I am currently looking for a therapist and to be on new medication) It happened recently and I don't know where else to go. I've tried posting on other ""weight loss"" subs but they just don't understand. I am just trying to live here, and I feel as though I'm never living or enjoying life. I'm always preparing to be thin. ""When I meet my boyfriend and we are intimate I will be thin"" ""When I meet my best friend and her mom I will be skinnier"" ""Once I lose 50 pounds I will finally be pretty and worth something"" It's never ending every second of my life. One day, if I'm eating well I will think I look different. But god forbid I eat even one thing ""off track"", I will think how I haven't changed at all and instead have stepped back even further. These dieting people don't understand what counting calories does to a person, I do want to be healthier. But in the height of my eating disorder I would count every single calorie. I'd eat no more than one full meal a day if that. I'd go to college while only drinking a coke zero. And that year, before covid, was the year I got the most comments on how good I was looking. I was finally doing it, and then covid wrecked everything. I met my now ex, who made me feel like I couldn't even breathe sometimes. Undiagnosed bpd, untreated eating disordered brain. I still am suffering. I still look back to being 18 and want to be her again. On the way to being thin. I don't know how to cope with who I am. I feel like I cannot start life until I look like the girls I see on social media. Even my friends. I am sick.

I really hope I'm not offending anyone and I try to be as sensitive as I can in this post and clarify my intentions but sometimes I'm not the best at wording things sorry. Please let me know immediately if I've said anything prejudiced or offensive as I want to learn and be a more supportive person to this community.

Firstly, what causes children to reach a weight that is considered 'obese' in childhood (I am not saying that this label or bmi are correct in any way and I completely understand that there is nothing moral or health-related connected to being classed as 'obese')? Are children with this label just at their set point weight, is this a result of forced diets from when they were a slightly lower weight or do diet and exercise come into it at all?

Is there any way that weight gain could be caused diet (quality and quantity) and exercise in a metabolically healthy person who is at their set point weight and not in a calorie deficit of any kind?

Thank you so much in advance! Please let me know if I've made any mistakes or have the wrong impression of anything.

Edit: I'm extremely sorry for using a dehumanizing and offensive term to refer to those in larger bodies. There is no excuse for this and I shouldn't have used it. I will do my best to use more sensitive language in the future. I have kept the word in the post for now because I don't want to pretend that this mistake didn't happen but if anyone would like me to remove it please let me know and I will do so immediately.

The video is such a trip but does include mention of weight loss, specific weight loss numbers/goals and Ryan stepping on a scale so may not be for everyone.

I'm really happy about finding this sub. Even in the most critical groups of people I know, all the dogmas we have about our body shapes, weight and sizes are left unquestioned. My partner really opened my eyes about it.

I got back to yoga and running recently, and I'd like to develop my practice with a critical point of view. I really struggle to find any sense of community when it comes to physical exercise. I'm really lucky as I'm slowly forming a group of good people to go running with occasionally though.

Anyway, I'm starting to realize that if I want to develop a true sense of my own body, how to care for it and how to live in it, I cannot just rely on people who symbolically are in charge when it comes to that.

I used to think the people who talked a lot about 'fitness', even if they were judgmental of other people's bodies, or even toxic in their behavior, were deep down more knowledgeable and qualified than me to talk about how my own body should feel and how it should look like.

Now I realize that while I need a scientific knowledge of how my body works, I'm on my own if I want to create any kind of body culture that is not based on hate and (patriarchal, racist) myths.

Can I trust a yoga teacher who doesn't seem to have a critical approach of yoga, its history and how 95% how people who do it are self-hating, anxious young women who are afraid of their destiny in a world where the shape of their butts should be a clue about their work and personal ethics.

Can I trust anyone talking about running who is not taking into account that most people run out of shame and dismorphophobia?
Can I trust anyone to tell me what I should do with my body, with myself, to feel good and happy? It seems not. It seems I need to learn everything on my own if I want to avoid falling in the trap of the fatphobic fitness culture all around me.

I'm angry to only realize this at 32, and I'm angry about how difficult it is to own my own body, but I'm happy because for the first time I think of myself as a valuable source of information about how my body feels and should feel and what I want to do with it or not 🌸",1638751371.0

I'm proud of myself. For Thanksgiving dinner I've made myself a charcuterie board with homemade focaccia bread. And this is not a special dinner for me - I literally had charcuterie two nights ago.

And what I like about charcuterie is that there is no pressure to clear my plate. There's no set serving size - I can just graze. As a dieter, I hated grazing boards because I was always so worried about how much I ate. But now, as an intuitive eater, I really enjoy this layout.

On the one hand, I'm aware that the fashion industry has a huge, huge issue with fatphobia and a total lack body diversity, and I'm sure that's seeped into me over the years. It's also hard to reconcile the thought ""I'm more than my body, I'm not an ornament to be viewed, I don't want to self-objectify"" with a desire to explore fashion, since a lot of the time it's all about being viewed and looked at, and dressing up your body a certain way. 

On the other hand, it'd break my heart to throw my love of fashion out the window and solely focus on utilitarian clothing or something. I find so much creativity and joy in exploring clothing's array of colors, textures, intriguing or artistic patterns, or the history of it all. I love how changing an outfit can make me feel like a badass gladiator or an ethereal princess, depending on what what I'm feeling that day. Looking in the mirror and knowing that what I feel on the inside is being expressed in color or shape or fabric on the outside makes me feel great, and more like myself. 

But yeah, the issue is now that I've been in the anti-diet world for a while, I keep circling back to that same thought of my passion for fashion not aligining with my anti-diet, body-neutral goals, worries that I'm perpetuating the same awful system that broke my self-image in the first place and has harmed so many other people, etc.

So... Thoughts? Is there a way to reconcile fashion with an anti-diet mentality? If reconciliation isn't possible, how should I start approaching clothing?

Even now when I see a comment about having ob*se kids as being child abuse…or that fat kids should be taken away from their parents…I instantly cry.

I replied back “hard pass” and she asked why. I proceeded to tell her 95% of diets fail, I have no interest in calorie restriction dressed up as “nutrition,” and don’t like to do hard work outs to punish my body for eating carbs. I expected that to be the end of it but she then said she was interested in knowing more (while also telling me they count macros and micros 🙄) and invited me to check out the gym. I sent her a link to Lindo Bacon’s “body respect” and told her it was the best resource I could offer, wished her a happy holiday, and told her I would no longer be replying to her messages. The surprise to all this was that she texted me one more time saying thank you for the resource and that she downloaded the audiobook, and wished me a nice holiday as well.

Made an appt for allergy cough and this b*tch diagnosed me with obesity,50,qwucvl,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/qwucvl/made_an_appt_for_allergy_cough_and_this_btch/,23,"Update on this mess: I FINALLY got better, though it took a long while. I also now think it may have been a non-covid virus and not just allergies because both my parents (who actually do keto and so are on hardly any carbs AND neither are overweight) ended up with the exact same symptoms. So, maybe a virus or maybe these devil allergies just affected us the same way? My oldest child also got sick, though not the same symptoms like we all had. Anyways they went to Dr and got 2 different types of medications for help with cough and inhalers that didn't cost $200 like mine did (I couldn't afford it so got nothing). So. Definitely not going back to that POS doctor ever again. If anyone else has something like this happen, don't let a stupid Dr gaslight you

Rant! I almost am more amused than mad though. I seriously made an appointment (online, plush care) because my seasonal allergies are extra terrible this year and have moved into my chest, making me miserable. I couldn't find an appointment time for my normal doctor, so chose another that had decent star ratings. 

She laughed and said that my diet was a big problem, because yeah I eat carbs. I mean, if cutting down on breads helps, then sure. I need a healthier diet, my schedule has been crazy so if I  should do something different I am open to that..

I also don't think that is the main reason my allergies are killing me though, through all sizes I have had bad allergies.  They are just worse this year. 

W/ever, I got an inhaler too so, hopefully that works. But when I later looked at diagnoses she put down obesity .-.  when I just wanted help with a cough.

I Feel Like I Will Never Heal,14,qwyw5u,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/qwyw5u/i_feel_like_i_will_never_heal/,3,"So I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while. This is the first time I've posted because I'm still struggling with my body image and antidieting journey in ways that aren't constructive and I didn't want to burden the community with it, but I'm just utterly baffled and disappointed with what just happened right now. It's brought up a lot of pent up feelings, and I apologize if I do not make sense.

I watch Mythical Kitchen often because I love how they seemed to not be so moralizing about what they're making and what they're eating... which is why I was incredibly shocked to see in the most recent video they posted they took a sponsorship from fucking noom! I immediately backed out of the video as soon as I saw the sponsorship, but the frustration and disappointment I have lingers. Ngl it kinda broke me.

I'm just so tired of being bombarded with dieting, fatphobic, pro-ed, and iwl stuff constantly in my life when I'm in such a fragile state, basically preventing me from ever being able to heal. I do what I can to curate my own experience, but all that stuff just keeps getting to me, crossing over every boundary I have. ""Wellness"" culture gets to the plus size people I follow. No one really listens to me when I tell them that talking about dieting and iwl is harmful for my mental health, and that it's not good for their physical or mental health. No one in the greater scheme cares, and can even be outright hostile to the ideas of antidieting, haes, and ie (I mean, you can hardly traverse reddit without seeing someone blame literally anything on fat people). My therapist does what she can, but it's not enough because I'm the one teaching her about antidieting, ie, and haes. I can't afford a body image coach or an rd, and I'm utterly useless when it comes to just teaching myself... it's what I've been trying to do for almost 10 years and I'm still as fragile as ever, if not worse.

I have a very large body and they actually asked me in a very terse tone whether or not I “even exercise at all” and spent most of the visit talking about how I need to eat vegetables instead of actually listening to how I live my life and the choices that I make, when it comes to eating habits or exercise. They completely ignored my want to get a therapist referral so I can see someone within my network, and one of the bewildered nurses told me to just stop having suicidal thoughts when I told them that I have them because of my depression and anxiety. So obviously top notch pros we’re dealing with🙄

Anyways I have another issue that I needed to deal with when I first went there, but there wasn’t enough time to deal with it so I sent a message to the office asking about it. I’m just feeling nervous because in the past when I’ve sent messages they don’t respond with very helpful information. I am looking into going to a new doctor/clinic, but right now I think this issue is pressing enough that I should deal with it before trying to switch. 

I know that the doctor is going to come back to me and tell me that it’s happening because of my weight and that if I lose weight this problem will go away but really I just want to deal with the issue right now without the trauma and judgement. It’s an acne thing that requires antibiotics or retinol cream.

Anyways this along with other stress in my life has got me into a weird depressive/anxious state, and I’m obsessing over the idea of spitefully going on hunger strike to prove how unhealthy losing weight at any cost is. 

I know it would only hurt myself, but I’m just tired of all the fatphobia and the fact that doctors withhold treatment from fat people because they assume that we must be unhealthy because we’re bigger even though they have no training an extensive nutrition, and barely have the qualifications to diagnose these kinds of things; especially when they don’t even ask what kind of lifestyle you have. Because if you’re fat the only reason you would ever be sick is weight. That being over weight or fat is apparently a disease now instead of an adjective. It’s just really lazy doctoring.

It feels like if you were to go to the doctor and say that you have the flu they would talk to you about losing weight in order to avoid getting the flu as often.

If they did this to any other group of people there would be riots in the streets. And it’s not as if doctors are saying to tall people “Tall people are more likely to get heart disease so you should try cutting off part of your shin before I treat your ear infection.”",1636632926.0

Doubts about accepting myself,23,qpobch,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/qpobch/doubts_about_accepting_myself/,15,"## TW: talks of weight loss, unhealthy mindsets, body image issues

This post can be very triggering for some so please read with caution 

So I am down in a rut right now regarding my body. I’m a student so I have little time to do pretty much anything activity wise and I feel like I’m slowly going to become immobile. I am slightly above average and while I can identify things that I love and appreciate about my body I see lots of laws, mainly cause of societal standards. I constantly find myself checking my belly in the mirror and sucking it in to see how I would look without it, I check myself from all angles and take negative mental notes about my current body vs my past body. 

Consciously I don’t want to lose weight, but I am unhappy with how I look right now and I honestly don’t know how to deal with it. I think it’s because since I was 14 I wanted the ideal body (which is all bs and fake) and I keep going back to that mentality. I sometimes feel I was happier when I was unhappy going to the gym and restricting food but truth is I only felt happy cause I had hope that I would reach weight x and suddenly my issues would be fixed. Obviously that weight doesn’t exist and no matter how low I would’ve went I wouldn’t have been happy. Yet it’s like the realization that my goal will never be achieved makes me deeply sad even tho the goal was rigged from the start…

On top of that, I suspect I might have some thyroid issues (dry scalp, dry skin, breakouts, different smelling body odor) and lowkey I want to have a health issue because hypothyroidism if treated can help you lose weight and like… that is such a toxic mindset that I’m even embarrassed to spell it out

B.S. A lot of us are here because of our disability that keeps us from losing weight or causing weight gain. We are told that there’s no excuse, especially those of us with invisible disabilities because we pass as able-bodied. I know for a fact there are also people included in this movement who are limited in mobility and use assisted devices because being disabled does affect the metabolic system. 

A lot of people have told me that I have fibromyalgia because I’m in a larger body, but it’s the other way around. You can go to the fibromyalgia subreddit and see posts by people who go through the same thing as me. 

It’s ableist to ignore medical conditions that cause weight gain and just give the “yeah, but no” answer when they have no clue what it’s like to be us. And the comment that someone like me is ableist, from an able-bodied woman, really burned my biscuits.

First, some context: I've been working with a HAES/IE dietitian for about 6 months now, and for the last two I've been dealing with extreme hunger as my body has started to recognize it's not in a famine, and honoring that hunger has resulted in me gaining weight, which has been super stressful for me to say the least. 

I met with my dietitian yesterday, and she said something to me to try to help me accept my larger body, and to help me understand why I need to be eating more and not shaming myself for gaining weight even when I was already in a large body when I started working with her. She said to stop thinking of the fat on my body as ""extra"" or ""a surplus"" that I don't really need. And rather instead she encouraged me to think of it as something my body needs to be healthy and functional, because the amount of food I view as ""acceptable"" or ""what a normal person would eat,"" is so much lower than the amount of calories that I apparently need to be taking in just to function. I asked her why that was if body fat is just stored energy from what you take in, and she started talking about how it's in my genetics and that people are size diverse, and we didn't really have time to dive further into the details.

I guess really what I want to know is why I need to eat so much and weigh so much just for my body to not think I'm starving myself. I've just always thought of my body like the diet culture cliche ""there's a thin person inside trying to get out,"" and that I was supposed to be giving THAT person enough to eat, and not the extra bits of person that didn't need to be there. But my RD is saying that's not how it works, and that the fat on my body is just a part of me that I need, and I just don't understand why. I've seen the ASDAH ""poodle science"" video and I also often see the comparison made like, ""you wouldn't ask someone to try to reduce their height,"" but I'm confused why weight would work the same way, cause it's not like height is influenced by your environment or lifestyle the same way weight is. I get that genetics contribute a huge amount to determining your weight, but I guess I thought that just meant that various genes have programmed my body to store more fat than other bodies. But I still don't understand why that means my body ""NEEDS"" it to be there in the first place.

Ugh, I know I'm probably overthinking and stressing about this when I really just need to focus on getting enough to eat, but it's really hard to feel like I should be eating more when ""getting enough to eat"" is resulting in me gaining even more weight that doesn't seem to have a purpose but also apparently has to be there.

EDIT: Yeah, sorry everyone, I'm clearly just in a bad place and trying to justify my existence. The science is interesting to me, but I was asking for a sense of comfort and safety more than I was asking for information. I'm going to find a therapist to help me with all this since I'm obviously not handling it well on my own. Thanks to everyone who replied, this sub is full of so many kind people.",1635545155.0

BMI Rant,29,qi09ew,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/qi09ew/bmi_rant/,16,"CW: BMI, weight, weight loss

I need a little rant this evening. Earlier today, I was looking into the CDC guidelines for who qualifies for a covid booster. I already knew that I qualified for having a BMI in the “overweight” category, but being the compulsive rule follower that I am, I double checked it just to make sure (WHY, brain, why?!) I don’t technically know my current weight, but I just ballparked it (I have a good idea because I’ve had 2 kids in the last 4 years, so lots of doctors visits and being weighed). I knew it was going to confirm that I qualified, but what I wasn’t prepared for was the weight range they listed as “healthy” for me. The lowest weight was LESS than I weighed at age 17, when I was literally skin and bones (and also a CHILD). The highest weight was lower than I weighed at the peak of my adult dieting days, when I was severely restricting and exercising 5-6 days/week (and getting a TON of compliments for how small I’d made myself). I was honestly shocked. To realize that even if I were attempting to diet for “health” reasons rather than aesthetics, I could never diet or exercise myself down to a “healthy” BMI. Even when I was trying to the point where I was afraid to eat out because I wouldn’t know what to enter into my food tracking app, even when I skipped meals, even when I lived at the gym. Don’t get me wrong, I am so grateful to have discovered IE and broken free from diet culture, and I will NEVER go back, but to realize that the “goalpost” of a “healthy” weight is so absolutely ridiculous just sent me into a fresh wave of rage. I’m grateful for my knowledge, and my confidence in my health, I’m grateful to have healthcare providers who don’t care about weight, but holy shit, FUCK BMI.

To avoid the struggle with it, I have been very hesitant to do anything regarding my diet besides resisting the urge to binge without the restrictions. But its not taking me anywhere healthy. How do I avoid the toxicity of a diet while I try to get healthier? Exercise also becomes a game of counting calories, which leads to a binge.

I'm grieving so much of what could have been and there's still a lot of resentment there for her part in it. I'm sure many of us share that experience. 

I did it. I told her, the person who led me by a leash into my several EDs, the person who doesn't talk about anything but weight loss, that I would never go on another diet again. If this is even a smidgen of what fat liberation feels like...

Taking a break from vegetarianism,31,pp5b8v,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/pp5b8v/taking_a_break_from_vegetarianism/,17,"I found the following quite interesting: about two years ago, I stopped eating meat because (a) meat is my least favorite food group (give me noodles with a side of bread, please) and (b) the Amazon rainforest got burned down for cattle grazing and I was super sad. So I was like, hey, I don't even LIKE meat, and it's killing the Earth to create this stuff...no thank you. (If bread was killing the planet, I'd be like ""see you in Hell"" but that's another story.)

So that was about two years ago. But for the last few months I've been craving meat. Specifically chicken. For a while I tried to ignore it, but it was just getting stronger. So I finally said screw it, I'm taking the month off of vegetarianism. Call it my meaty September.

For the first week, I was ordering chicken on everything. Even dishes that don't come with it. Then I decided my meat-eating extends to bacon as well, which has been divine. The second week I was pretty excited about it, too. But now I'm three weeks in and I'm back to my old ""I don't care just as long as it has carbs"" mentality.

When I simply wasn't eating meat and didn't want to, I barely noticed it was gone. But when I started having cravings and _resisting_ them, meat became the forbidden treat.

Newly fat with a thin partner,64,plzem7,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/plzem7/newly_fat_with_a_thin_partner/,13,"Hey everyone.

I’m not sure why I’m writing this, or what exactly I hope to get out of this, but it’s something that’s on my mind often, and perhaps, community support will help alleviate the figurative weight. 

I was always a slightly-larger-than-average-person. A chubby baby, big kid, curvy young adult. Because of this, and as a result of growing up in a “health” conscious and image conscious household with thin parents, my food was restricted early and often. Consequently, I have a long history of disordered eating: periods of intense dieting, light bulimia, anorexic behaviors, compulsive exercise . 

When I met my partner three years ago, I was the thinnest I have ever been. I felt like I had solved it, like I’d resolved my fatness, and that I finally understood the way normal (aka thin) people experience the world. I thought I’d remain that size forever. 

After two years of intense restricting, my body started fighting back. It began to revert to its previous (and natural) size even though my eating  behaviors remained the same and my exercise regimen continued to punish me. I tried everything I could to stop the mounting weight gain, but nothing would prevent my body from doing what it intended to do. Exhausted and defeated, 10 months ago I began intuitive eating.

As I write this, I am 100lbs heavier than I was when i met my partner, and at least 50 pounds heavier than I was when I started IE. I should note that she has been supportive of me throughout this journey, frequently reminding me that i am beautiful and valuable as I am. That being said, I feel a lot of conflict and pain about the way my body has changed and now looks, specifically in the context of our relationship. I feel guilt that I bamboozled or misled her by presenting as a thin person when we first met, for not disclosing “my true self.”

As I’ve moved away from dieting, my body has passed through thin privilege to marginalization. For the first time, I am thinking about whether i will fit into seats and rides, preparing for feeble  patio chairs to splinter at any moment beneath my body, and noticing that I am being treated differently ( worse) than before by strangers and new acquaintances. What’s more, I feel intensely embarrassed about my new body. I worry extensively about friends and family members of my partner seeing me for the first time in several years (since  covid), and I spend a lot of time predicting their shock and horror (upon seeing this inflated version of me). 

Oftentimes, I feel like the hardest thing about being fat is being a fat partner to my thin, conventionally attractive girlfriend.

Hi, I have a couple random questions about antidiet that I haven't found any answers for and maybe you guys might know some stuff.

1. What is the antidiet stance on bodybuilding? (My bf is into it)
   1. Is eating more to bulk a diet?
   2. Is eating macros a diet if your aim is to gain weight?
   3. Would I be dieting if I was eating to train for pole dancing? I have a book about the ins and outs of pole dancing and it has a chapter on ""nutrition"" which I've completely avoided because anti-diet but if I followed it more for a general guide without the pretence of weight loss would that be a diet? I don't want to diet but I do want to progress my skills and if ""nutrition"" helps then I wouldn't mind looking into it *slightly* (I don't want to diet)
2. Can exercising long term without dieting change your body? I know in HAES it has studies about exercising and effect on weight + body composition and that in general it resulted in weight gain and increase in fat/no change in body composition in women. My questions about this is
   1. Does this apply for both cardio based exercise as well as weight lifting etc?
   2. If there is no change in body composition but there is an increase in strength how does that work? Because from what I've been told more muscle = more strength
   3. Can weightlifting etc change the way your body looks without dieting?
3. How does antidiet look if you have children? From my understanding you eat what you want because you body knows what it wants/needs and if you're craving something you should eat it. I guess my question is as a kid we were always limited when it came to chocolate and icecream etc because it was ""unhealthy"" and how that would look if you didn't have those limitations. Would kids eat those foods all day or would the lack of those limitation mean that they don't feel the need to eat it unless they really want it?

I have never been comfortable with the way all my bones stick out. Eating enough is hard for me due to medical conditions. So my natural set point is probably higher than where I'm at. I've been trying to gain weight over the past couple years by IE, nice and slowly. There's just one problem. I love horse riding more than life itself. And unfortunately generally the heavier you are, the more likely there will be an animal welfare issue. So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know gaining weight would improve my comfort in my body, but it will have a negative impact on my ability to do what I love. This seems like a recipe for developing a restrictive ED. I cant really bring this up in the horse community, because most people's answer would be ""just diet to stay skinny"" smh. Any ideas on how to reconcile these desires in a healthy way?",1630918598.0
Need Advice on Finding Support System,8,pikzvn,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/pikzvn/need_advice_on_finding_support_system/,8,"Edit: thank you everyone for being so kind and giving me advice that I haven't even thought of yet. It's very helpful

Hello, the rules don't say anything about vent related posts so I'm taking that as my ok. I'm also looking for advice here.

I just moved out of an abusive household to live with another family member. I'm doing a lot better here and there's not really any way I can move out again, especially considering that I'm not working at the moment.

I also have hypoglycemia. Basically this means my blood sugar gets low very quickly and if I don't treat it I die. Not just talking out of my ass, I've had experience with this for 8 years now.

This also means I need more sugar and carbs than the average person. Most people pick up on this and sometimes comment on it, saying stuff like ""you're gonna have health problems in the future if you keep eating so much sugar.""

Another layer: I'm recovering from an eating disorder. When people do comment it's a huge trigger, but it used to not happen often enough for it to matter. That's changed since I started living with my grandma. She's very much subscribed to diet culture and is convinced that whenever I have any health problem it's caused by how much sugar I eat. This happens often since I'm chronically ill. She blames all my chronic illness symptoms on the fact that I treat my lows.

This has been really bothering me, but it was the worst last night. She started blaming my chronic illness symptoms on my sugar intake so I stood up for myself. I gave her studies saying that sugar isn't actually the cause of all my problems. She told me I was wrong and the study was lying and that I'm being tricked by capitalism and I'm gonna die very young because of it. Let's just say that I wasn't able to sleep much at all last night because it was bothering me so bad.

I understand that I need professional help, but I don't trust my current doctors. I know they'll see my sugar intake and tell me to lower it, or tell me that I'm gonna die young. It's already happened with my current therapist. I really really need a professional to help me with this but I don't know where to look. And my self confidence is so low right now that I know one bad comment from a doctor will cause me to spiral. I don't know how to safely find a doctor that specializes in eating disorders, isn't fatphobic, doesn't follow diet culture, AND doesn't trigger me. I feel so lost. Please let me know if you know how to find a good doctor/find a support system considering my current needs",1630874745.0

Was talking with my mom how frustrating it was  that there are anti-vax doctors giving family members of mine bad advice. I have two little cousins who are old enough to get the vaccine but are not because of bad advice from their doctors. One of things they were told is not to worry about their kids because all the kids in the hospital with COVID are obese. Obvs I am not a Dr, but their advice runs counter to everything I have read and I have seen videos of kids in the hospital who definitely are NOT obese. 
But my mom dug in talking about ""well apparently most of  them are!"" And then started a long story about some guy who died recently with COVID, then turned around and said, ""but so and so knew he would die because he had become obese!"" This whole time I am giving verbal cues that I am NOT cool with where this Convo is going, she was taking this as an opportunity to lecture me on my weight.

I have been on this anti-diet intuitive eating journey for a few years now and was feeling very good about myself! Then I got pregnant. I had horrible morning sickness for so long. Enough to be put on medication. So I didn't eat many vegetables or nutrient-dense foods. A lot of crackers! I had a good run in the second trimester, just to get hit with a gestational diabetes diagnosis. For 12 weeks I had to eat low-carb, high protein and take my blood sugar 4 times a day. I also had to exercise every evening or my blood sugar was too high. It was tough but of course, I did it for the health of the baby and myself. It was incredibly triggering as it was all diet talk and there were too many numbers - my old diet brain started feeling like if I did a bad job my number would be high. I hated going back to watching what I ate so closely, but I did it and it was finally over after baby was born! I was so happy in the hospital after having the baby I was eating whatever I wanted, finally!

I have had a good 2 months now of recalibrating. It's hard to eat nutrient-dense food with a newborn, but I've given myself lots of room to eat whatever I needed after being restricted for 3 months. And guess what happens at around 2 months old? It looks like my baby is reacting to the milk protein in my breastmilk, so the pediatrician had me cut out dairy and soy. I've been doing it now for a couple of weeks, and while I don't hate the foods I can eat, it is just another restrictive diet thrown at me. It isn't forever, luckily, but I'm just lost now. I am kind of paralyzed when trying to find meals to eat. What foods do I even LIKE anymore? 

Does anyone have any good info on how food allergies work with intuitive eating? How can I get back to enjoying making and eating food? Anyone else gone through something similar?

I visited recently and was given an innocent but ignorant and unintentionally offensive comment by the phlebotomist. I’m writing to ask that you speak to the staff in a general manner about a couple assumptions about larger bodied people that they should NEVER make.  
 
She said “don’t take this the wrong way, but if you lose weight you might get pregnant really quickly.”  
 
This comment says a couple things: 

I’m judging you by your body size. You probably aren’t pregnant yet because you appear to be fat, and therefore must be too unhealthy to conceive naturally.  

I’m disregarding the possibility that your partner may have issues that are contributing to the lack of successful pregnancy.  

I have no idea how long you have been trying 

What worked for me might work for you 
 
This comment was severely triggering, stressful and as I mentioned before, IGNORANT.  
 
A patient’s health status, size, and weight in regard to pregnancy is between the patient and her doctor. The phlebotomist drawing blood has no business commenting, especially in an unsolicited way.  
 
 
Previously, I also had an encounter with another nurse that was stressful and unnecessary. She asked me to step on the scale and I did so on the manual one, which was right next to a digital one. I told her what my weight was, but she continued moving the weight too far low and then too far high. There I am standing in this small corner, watching this number fluctuate between XXX and XXX, when I told her it should be ABC lbs. After messing with the scale for an embarrassingly long time, she asked me to step on the digital one. This one again, fluctuated .2 lbs up and down up and down. She would not record the weight until it stopped. It was moving again I felt this was totally unnecessary for record keeping purposes. What did she end up writing in my chart? ABC lbs, once it registered on the scale. Because she didn’t believe me when I said it.  
This was a routine visit; my exact weight down to the gram did not matter. I have previously declined being weighed, but this time thought oh fine, I’ll cooperate. This is why I decline to be weighed. It should be on/off quick transaction - less than 30 seconds. ESPECIALLY since peoples weight is something that MOST of your patience have issues and sensitivity with! It makes sense if you are monitoring weight gain for an ongoing pregnancy or if you’re being anesthetized. But not for a well womens exam.

I get it, of wanting to feel your best and that eating well and moving your body before photos make sense. And I'd said I got that, I  wanted to broaden the conversation about how it's also easy for women to get into that space of not enoughness of 'I've got to get photo ready'. 

And my friend disagreed with me, not seeing my point, being like she's not doing a yoyo diet. Honestly felt like my pov was getting lost..

I had some taken pics a few months back after not being well, so had gained weight from inactivity and noticed changes in my body, muscle loss etc. But I won a boudoir shoot and was in the narrative, yes, I'm not feeling my best, but I'm worthy of my photo being taken.

Help - diagnosed w high cholesterol,17,p3y0ue,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/p3y0ue/help_diagnosed_w_high_cholesterol/,14,"(CW - talking about eating to help manage high cholesterol)

So, I have been recovering from a childhood and young adulthood of dieting and food deprivation for about 10 years, and just tested with really high cholesterol. It's a concern because my mom had a heart attack at about my age (late 40s), although, ironically, hers was due to yo yo dieting and diet pills. I'll probably be going on medication for it, but because it's newer to me with age, I'd also like to try making some food that could help it out without dieting or deprivation (i.e. I read that fish like salmon and tuna is good to eat -- love both!).

Has anybody managed medical issues that could be helped by changing some of what you eat/adding different foods to your routine  without plunging headlong into dieting?

I was trying to google to learn a little bit about foods that might lower cholesterol or enjoyable recipes that contain foods that are good to eat (as opposed to what NOT to eat) and it's like a giant diet minefield that is already triggering me. 

So thought I'd check here to see if there's any suggestions. Any ideas? Any books I can read that won't send me in a downward spiral but might inspire me in terms of experimenting with things that I would enjoy eating? I love cooking and would especially be interested in  cookbooks or cooking blogs  (obviously anything that does not include any diet language. I refuse to return to my old joyless life of egg whites, margarine, dry chicken breast and fat-free dressing on the side).

"No matter how many resources I go through, I can't stop feeling like it's all my fault.",42,p2e90p,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/p2e90p/no_matter_how_many_resources_i_go_through_i_cant/,21,"Everyone from the RD I'm working with to the resources I've read through here to podcasts like Food Psych to antidiet people on TikTok have been hammering in the message that my weight is neither my fault nor something I can ever truly control. But all the factors people bring up besides lifestyle choices are either hard to understand, easily explained away when I try to apply it to me, or just not applicable to me personally. My RD is so kind and is clearly trying so hard to help me understand it all, but I've just got so much anxiety tied to my body size that I just can't take this message in if it feels like I can refute the evidence. 

I know that the real solution here is ""keep working on managing your anxiety and keep talking with your RD about all this,"" and I'm not trying to start a debate because I fully believe what the research and science says about all the reasons people might end up being in a larger body. I definitely know a huge contributor for me is my history of dieting and weight-cycling that's driven my set point range higher and higher. I guess I'm hoping that maybe someone here who understands the science around some of the other factors more than me can hear my line of logic and confirm whether or not what I'm thinking makes sense or if it's pure anxiety mixed with internalized diet culture that's making me feel like none of these things apply to me and I just want an excuse for being in a larger body.

Body Size Contributors I Either Don't Understand or Can't Fully Accept for Myself:

* **Genetics.** Nearly everyone in my extended family is in a larger body, so it would make sense that I just naturally would be, too, right? But nearly all of them also live pretty inactive lifestyles and aren't conscious of food choices, so it feels like I can't necessarily just chock it all up to DNA.
* **Upbringing.** I don't live in a food desert, my family was never food insecure, and only on extremely rare occasions did anyone forbid specific foods. One on hand, my parents were really oblivious to their own inability to cook good, nutrient-dense food, so at an early age I heavily favored pleasure foods because that was the option that actually tasted good. But even as an adult who knows how to actually prepare food that tastes good, I still opt for pleasure foods quite often, so it just feels like I know better but keep making poor choices.
* **Medication.** I've been on several different meds over the years that made me rapidly gain weight, particularly when I was a teenager. But a lot of my peers have been on the same meds, and after they were off them for a few months their weights all just naturally went back down. I'm the only person I know who went off those meds whose weight never reset. What gives?
* **Mental Health/Internalized Weight Stigma.** This is the one I just flat-out don't understand. The way people talk about it, the concept comes across like when I've been fat-shamed, or food-shamed, or even just hear people express fatphobic thoughts, your brain feels like you're in danger, and it tries to deal with that by spiking your cortisol levels to tell your body to gain weight. Is that even close to an accurate understanding of this concept? Like it sounds to me like the ""Explain Like I'm 5"" version of this is ""If you weren't so sensitive about your weight or afraid of gaining weight, you wouldn't have stressed your body into gaining more weight."" That feels hard to believe.
* **Dieting/Weight-Cycling.** I get it, I've absolutely been doing this for years, 99% of it makes sense. I understand any kind of food restriction is unsustainable. But it's hard to shake the feeling like I just didn't have enough self-control to resist the temptation and biological urges to eat the foods I cut out. Like, some of the antidiet activists I've followed make it sound like when you're dieting and your body thinks you're in a famine, eventually you will reach a point where your hunger hormones will literally take over your brain and force you to binge on foods your body knows will give it immediate energy and have enough extra that will ensure you start regaining weight. I don't understand if I'm just looking at this part the wrong way or if that's just how it's been framed for me to make me feel like it's not my fault for lacking the willpower to stick to a diet. And that's when it starts to feel like I'm just looking for an excuse for being in a larger body.

Again, I'm not trying to refute any of the facts here, and I know that right now the best thing I can do for myself is work on my anxiety (I'm in therapy and trying to find the right meds to help with this),  keep working with my RD to heal my relationship with food and eat intuitively. My RD is great but I'm only able to meet with her about once a month, and right now my anxieties about this are so overwhelming that I just can't handle waiting that long to try to understand/accept these ideas.

How to balance food freedom with digestive issues?

But, I’ve had a gross problem at my highest weight, so part of me is scared to gain weight to that point again and have it come back.


When I was in my early 20s, I developed atypical AN, and when recovering, ended up about double my starting weight a few years later. During that time, I had *horrific* heartburn more or less all the time.



It improved slightly, pain-wise, with medications, but at my highest, I would still experience serious pain from it after meals. And I would throw everything up again, two or three times a week. Usually nausea on the other days.



Not on purpose! The reflux was just so bad that it caused nausea and ruined my esophagus- literally kept me from keeping food down. So, I decided to lose weight. Lost a good bit, though still fat, and have now gained some, but not all, back.



I want to be able to try new foods and not feel like I have to restrict myself. But trust me, *no one* wants to feel that sick all the time. And I feel like if I gained weight and this problem came back, it would almost be like a b/p cycle, though I’m not doing it on purpose.

"So glad to see this community exists, because I am about to have a lap band removed and I can’t wait!",72,oxpzrv,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/oxpzrv/so_glad_to_see_this_community_exists_because_i_am/,28,"It’s the same typical story. Woman makes baby, woman terrorizes baby until baby is an adult and then some. Woman convinces child  is giant, fat, disgusting, ugly, useless, gross. Child is blind and has no frame of reference, so just believes mother unquestioningly. Mother starts talking about how the lap band is the greatest new weight loss surgery ever and the child should get it. Mother doesn’t try anything except cereal dieting, which obviously fails. Says it is the child’s choice if she wants to get the band, but then will just slip it into any old conversation at any random point.

Child gets band. Child drops way crazy fast. Child thinks she likes her self again. Mother doesn’t like child any more than before. Child only got lap band so that mommy would love her more. Child, obviously now in adult, throws up most days of her life. Has severe food anxiety. Literally cannot eat a meal without crying, completely freaking out and panicking about whether or not I will actually be able to keep it inside me. Oh look. We switch tenses. 

I had my band installed in 2013. It was great for a couple years. I didn’t have to do anything. I just barely needed to eat, and the band would do the rest. It’s like medically supervised bulimia. What a time. Also, I am in Canada, where healthcare is usually covered. I say usually, because my mother decided that we needed to spend the trust fund my grandfather had made for me. The lap band surgery cost $16,000. So now that I am at a place where I want it out, you can imagine the shame and guilt that is going along with this.

“We spent $16,000 to help you lose weight. What the hell is wrong with you? You are always going to be fat. Forever! And ever! “

Now let’s talk about mom for a second. She has spent my entire life being an abusive piece of crap about my weight. And her weight obviously, but she refuses to do anything to actually help herself. Before the band surgery, I had to go on a 1000 cal crash diet for two weeks so that my liver was not in danger of being too huge. I did it with gusto. For some reason. We have these evil shapes that we had to buy, spent hundreds of dollars on them. And they were honestly the worst. Mom promised she would do the shakes with me and she was going to go through this diet with me as a team. She lasted one fucking day. Then on the ride to the hospital, she couldn’t stand it anymore, so doctors into a Thai restaurant for a cup of soup that night.

 also, despite her continued harping for me to get the band, she refused to do it herself. Then at one point she said she needed to go to fat person rehab. I thought she was just being annoying, but I actually googled, and fat person rehab exists. Guess who made up 100 excuses why she couldn’t go there?

But the hell has an end in sight. I saw a bariatric doctor yesterday and he told me he could have the band out within the next eight weeks. I have started exercising just before quarantine. Then of course quarantine happened and we had to pause. But I came back when we opened up again, and I came back with a vengeance. I love swimming. And I can now do an average of 1 1/2 km a day in the pool, as well as anywhere from 2 to 6 km of walking. On top of that, our city just opened a new trampoline park which I can’t wait to play at forever, and hopefully martial arts should be reopening soon. I love Krav Maga and BJJ, so lots of exercise options for me now.So my entire attitude towards exercise has completely shifted. And I do not want a revision surgery. They offered to give me the bypass instead, but that comes with a whole other host of complications that I’m not interested in experiencing for the rest of my life. I want to do this naturally. Of course I have the same fear that everyone here has. I don’t want to be fat forever. Even though it’s supposed to be OK, it doesn’t feel OK. But at the same time, my body has a crazy amount of strength that I never realized it had before. My muscles like me for once.

And now the main part of the evil. The lap band says you are supposed to be able to lose weight while still eating whatever you love. But do you want to know what I cannot eat with a lap band no matter how hard I try? Vegetables and fruits. So I can suck down a bag of chips without thinking about it. But the minute I eat one tomato, one grape, one fucking strawberry, I will be throwing up for the rest of the day. How evil is that? So before my original surgery, it was normal for me to eat a full North American family size bag of chips to myself, as well as usually 2 L of Diet Coke in a day, and a few chocolate bars. Every, single, day. I would never ever do that now. I just want to eat vegetables! Carrots. Celery. Hummus! Remember how great hummus is? So who in their right mind makes a weight loss surgery that does not allow you to actually eat the food that is the best food for you? What a super huge stinky pile of crap.

And speaking of super huge stinky piles of crap, have any of you ever experienced the lap band before? If so, how were your farts? Mine or something to behold. I could probably make an orchestra with my bum after every meal. It is quite hilarious, because I have the maturity of a 14 year old boy. But it’s also really loud, awkward, and weird. After a particularly challenging meal, I have been known to let out one continuous 10 to 15 second long fart. I will need to make sure I record that before getting this band removed so we can sample it later. Lol.

Anyway, this is just been a rant about weight loss surgery and all the delightful shame that comes with it. Thanks for reading. I hope you are all taking good care of yourselves and being kind to you. I am proud of everyone who has been on this. We are definitely living outside what is considered the norm, and it is really terrifying. But everyone here is doing such amazing work. Thank you so much for this community. So much love.
Edit: I was having a very chill time in the lake and when I came out I saw one missed call from the hospital. My surgery is on the 19th. I can’t believe it! That is way sooner than expected! Also thank you everyone who responded to me. Your support is incredibly touching and means the world to me. I don’t know any of you, but I appreciate everyone of you.",1628073731.0

Going to the doctor. I'm anxious,10,otj0vu,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/otj0vu/going_to_the_doctor_im_anxious/,16,"Hi everyone!

So I'm going to uni in September and I'm going to study nutrition (very excited about that!). However, because my course is in the ""health"" area of study, my uni demands a visit to the doctor to see if I'm healthy (I don't fully know why this is, but in the country I live this is standard for all health related courses).

This exam is usually normal stuff, like checking if I can hear/see properly, testing my reflexes, etc. However, I can almost guarantee they'll try to weight me. I'm not fully sure I can say no, because since this is something the uni demands, they can turn me down if I don't agree to taking the full exam.

So, how do I deal with it? I'm pretty sure I'm overweight (haven't weighed myself in about a year, but the pandemic made me gain a few pounds for sure) and I'm scared the doctor will start telling me I need to lose weight, etc. I have a history of disordered eating, but I've never been in treatment for it so it wouldn't be on my chart or anything. 

What would you recommend I do? Turn away from the scale? Risk it and say I don't want to be weighed?

In the past I would've just told myself that I can lose weight and look better but now I know that that isn't very attainable. And to be honest? That makes me feel worse. It makes me feel like there's nothing I can do to love my body. I've honestly tried so hard to accept the way it is. I follow mid size and plus size women on insta and I do think that they look beautiful. But when it comes to myself I just hate the way I look. I always cover up now. I feel awkward and ashamed of myself if I don't. 

I have very accepting friends and family and my boyfriend tries to tell me I'm beautiful and sexy all the time but I don't feel it at all. I feel so far from it. Before I did feel sexy. I felt beautiful. When I look back I feel even sadder about how I am now. And I feel there's nothing I can do to feel better. 

I feel it's affecting my relationship in that I've had long conversations with my boyfriend where Ive accused him that he would prefer me to look different when he's said he finds me attractive.

Gastric sleeve nearly killed my sister,135,op614p,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/op614p/gastric_sleeve_nearly_killed_my_sister/,33,"TW: Gaslighting, weight loss, medical trauma, suicidal ideation

My blood is boiling watching the fallout from my sister being coerced into a gastric sleeve and the horrendous medical fuckups that have followed.

My sister has struggled for years with mental health issues, and a byproduct of her medication was weight gain. As a happily fat person I have tried to encourage her to make peace with it, and that her mental health is what is important, but our family historically have idealised being thin and so it's been a constant source of shame and anxiety for her.

In January she decided she wanted a gastric sleeve. I pleaded with her to reconsider, showed the evidence of negative psychiatric outcomes (increased suicide risk, alcoholism) and that given she already was struggling and had risk factors this could make things much worse. But she made the decision to go ahead and met with a surgeon who seemingly cared very little about her medical background.

Fast forward a few months post surgery she found herself literally unable to eat. Prior to this she managed half a wrap a day, but at this point she was vomiting up water and couldn't even keep liquids down. She had many trips to emergency, all said it was in her head and cited her previous mental health admissions. Sending her home over and over and making her think she was imagining things.

A few weeks ago she collapsed and was admitted to hospital with starvation and severe dehydration. The surgeon at this point blamed her history of alcohol abuse and that she is ""mentally unstable"" and refused to take accountability. He performed an endoscopy and found nothing - so palmed her off to a psychiatrist. 

She ended up having to stay in hospital as starvation and dehydration comes with a whole host of issues like her organs shutting down. Low and behold after further investigations they found her oesophagus had all but entirely closed and she had a huge hiatal hernia. At this point she looks like a shell of her former self, is suicidal, and is having to get a feeding tube to survive until they can perform additional surgery to hopefully give her some semblance of a normal life.

I cannot believe they are doing this to people and not even going through the list of risks and complications with them. The surgeon does not give a fuck, he said I quote ""I'm a surgeon, I cut, what do you want from me"". He said he ""missed"" things during the endoscopy, but wont apologise. So anyone who claims these people do this for anyones ""health"" is utter bullshit. They asked zero questions about her mental state or history before removing her stomach, then have the audacity to blame complications on her, medically gaslighting her.

I will say at least all the nurses came and apologised for the treatment and gaslighting shes been receiving for months. I can't imagine what might have happened if we didn't continue to push for help and if she didn't have the bravery to keep fighting through what has been literal hell.

I have friends that are getting married and they are all dieting. Diet culture and obsession with thinness is so ingrained in my circles, and it’s just awful. 

As additional context, I’ve had some type of ED since age 10 (I’m almost 30). I spent years restricting, and my friends/family wavered between envy and concern. For the past 5 years, I have gained weight and spent so much time trying to diet to lose it but the past year+ of therapy / nutritionist have helped immensely and I’m finally rejecting diet culture.

I stopped dieting a little over a year now. Most of the time I'm feeling good about my decision, but sometimes I have hard days, when I see a picture of myself and I look different.

Sometimes when I listen to stories of people who ""overshoot"" and go back to a set weight I feel a little jealous bc I wish my body would do that. I know it's the culture that brainwashed me into having these kinds of thoughts, and that attaining a certain body type is not the purpose of this process. It's so hard to fight that little voice sometimes though. I began to get the message that something was wrong with my body when I was 7 or 8, and actively dieted in some way or another until I was 32. I know it takes time to reach a place of peace. I just want that time to be now. I can't square my desire for liberation from restriction and my desire to live in a smaller body, and it's been so hard to live with these mixed feelings.

I am medically classified as „obese“ formerly „overweight“ and when I started to dive into all these diets and fads I am feeling a bit depressed because I realised I haven’t done anything wrong in my life 

So just to give a brief summary. I was always fat from 6 years old after when my mom decided to add very high calorie foods to „make me strong“ etc since I was a sickly child. I was no longer a sickly child. Worse! I was a fat child ! 

Sometimes I really wish I had a time travelling machine just to tell my mom to not do this because even she regrets it badly so much that she took out her frustration on this choice of hers in my teen years. 

To resolve my fat problem and many other reasons I was shipped to boarding school at 9. and while I did lose a lot of weight I was still considered overweight. The truth was i didn’t really reduce my portion but actually ate more since we weren’t allowed to miss our food portions ( which is right on their part in my opinion since they have to ensure well being of many kids ) but we did a lot of exercise( much more than what an average urban kid would do in general ). I even joined a few sports ⚽️ because It turns out I love them.  But remember! I was still overweight! And the only major weight loss i had was when I fell seriously ill and needed to hospitalise .. but this massive „desirable“ weight loss came at a cost ! My lungs deteriorated and i got asthma so I couldn’t be equally active as I was ! And then I gained back a few kgs while in boarding school itself. Class teacher was concerned so tried to reduce my portions during lunchtime ( the class sat together and ate with teacher supervising). Moving to another boarding school didnt help because they had less of activities which got even more hampered due to puberty. Then the boarding school stopped and I had to return home and then began my struggles .. I only gained more weight with this sudden change of lifestyle. Mom berating me and mocking me at the gym while training didn’t help obviously. 

Went through all bizarre diets like paleo , keto and any o but I couldn’t continue due to illness or I simply couldn’t afford to ( being poor didn’t help at all!). Then I came to Germany and that’s when everything changed. Even though my daily activity increased a lot and my food options became relatively diverse , I only gained weight. Then I got depression and I started to have periodical starvation ( often even upto 2 days ) followed by binge eating or very bad eating habits .. of course I only ballooned . I got back on track finally with therapy. I dedicated to be more active , eat properly and in proper times .. there was no change 


And then I went to the doctor and measured me and I am 90kgs so it’s an obese BMI ! This is why he got my thyroid checked .. and it was good unfortunately. Then I decided to go to the gyno to get checked for PCOS ( my periods were also irregular) and voila ! Perfect ovaries ! He basically gave a 20 minute shaming session along with him being really unscientific and creepy for a man of science .

Also to add .. people keep telling me to stop overeating but I just don’t know where is this coming from because I genuinely cannot overeat at all before yakking it all out .

I actually don’t eat out more than once or twice a week, eat ethnic foods over western high fat food and I don’t like snacking ( I never got to snack in my childhood so this habit stayed on). I can understand if I lived in states where so called foods flood the market ( which means it’s not fat peoples fault at all)

"So annoyed by the ""sustainable weight loss"" idea",43,ogewsv,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ogewsv/so_annoyed_by_the_sustainable_weight_loss_idea/,26,"It's become popular to denounce ""disordered"" dieting, by saying that obsessing over calories is obviously bad, don't cut out whole food groups, etc.

But what I see recommended instead is ""sustainable"" dieting. I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean, exactly, because it's never more than vaguely defined. But it seems to mean combination of ""sustainable"" lifestyle changes, like substituting water for soda! Omg try mixing your rice with cauliflower rice! Park farther from the store! Just little tweaks. You don't have to obsess! If you're obsessed, that's disordered, and we all know disordered is bad.

But these tweaks...if you don't count calories obsessively, you'll probably unconsciously correct any deficit caused by them, by eating more of something else. That's literally the subject of dozens of 5K+ upvoted post on every single CICO sub on Reddit: don't forget the calories in X! You can't just spread the peanut butter randomly, weigh it out!

Well, which is it? Is it possible to lose weight permanently through easy, breezy sustainable lifestyle choices? Or do you have to commit to measuring your peanut butter for the rest of your life?

My experience says it's the latter. I'm actually quite good at losing weight. I know what it takes, and I know how to do it. And I know that substituting water instead of soda is not going to cut it. Not in the long term. Now I'm sure there's someone, somewhere, who painlessly cut out soda and lost a bunch of weight forever. But like, if it were that easy for most people, there wouldn't be 5K+ upvoted posts every day telling people to weigh their peanut butter.

And if you accumulate enough of these lifestyle changes to make a difference...guess what? You'll be in a caloric deficit. Which means you'll be hungry and obsessed with food. Unless you eat more, in which case you WON'T LOSE WEIGHT or will regain what you lost.

Personally, other people can do whatever they want. If weight loss is worth it to them, I am in no position to argue about what they do with their own body. Seriously I wish people well who are on that path. (I've been on it myself)

But for me personally, I refuse to live my one sacred life on God's green earth logging every calorie I eat. And don't tell me I don't have to do that to lose weight. Oh just substitute water for soda, take a walk around the block, hurr durr. It's gaslighting!",1625773737.0

In the past I have set rules like “I will try to limit myself to once a week” for instance. It never lasts though. I don’t want to stop all together but it is expensive and I feel bad mainly because I feel powerless to it. If I get a craving for it I MUST have it. Do I have anything to worry about?

Weight gain and boob pain - help!,3,oe5zvm,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/oe5zvm/weight_gain_and_boob_pain_help/,7,"So I'm fairly new to the anti-diet and intuitive eating ideas but I'm so on board with all of it. I've been doing a lot of work to re-asses how I think about myself and food and so far it's been a really positive (if difficult) journey. Like so many people, I've gained some weight over the last year or two but I'm working on accepting my body as it is and reminding myself that when clothes are tight, it's the clothes that are wrong and not my body. 

The one part that I'm really struggling with is that having gained weight, my breast are painful on a daily basis and in the 10 days leading up to my period it's excruciating. I don't want to get in to details of specific weights I've been previously but suffice to say I KNOW that the pain is specific to weight, it's not hormone related, it's not due to ill fitting bras, it wont pass with time and I have comfortably been at a lesser weight and the pain has massively reduced. 

My problem now is that I feel like the only way to control the pain without constant painkillers or hormone treatments is to try to lose weight. I DO NOT want to do this, I don't even know if I could bring myself now to restrict my food in any way but I genuinely don't know how else to reduce the boob pain long term. 

Has anyone else gone through this? I would really love to know I'm not alone in the boob agony.

Weight Neutral Ways to Live More Comfortably,100,o5w80r,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/o5w80r/weight_neutral_ways_to_live_more_comfortably/,27,"Posting this here since the fatphobes-in-denial elsewhere would otherwise dogpile the hell out of it. I remain convinced that weight gain and general ED recovery may come with physical discomfort, but those issues are a sign to simply modify your lifestyle in ways that are anti-diet and anti-restriction.

So, a small list. 

You can repost this too. 

Feeling Hot/Sweaty:
- Anti chafing balms, talc free powders, bike shorts
- Cool, damp towel on forehead, neck, backs of knees
- Cold drinks and snacks (milkshakes, popsicles, iced water/tea/soda, etc.)
- Cool showers

Joint Pain:
- Physical therapy with a weight-neutral professional
- Body strengthening activities if enjoyable and accessible (lifting, yoga, light walking, swimming, etc.)
- Obey pain signals to avoid injury
- No shame in using anti-inflammatory meds or mobility aids (canes, knee braces, etc.)

Digestive Issues:
- Be patient, especially if you sustained any organ atrophy or damage from restriction or purging
- Easily digestible foods (low-fiber carbohydrates, low-fiber smoothies, milkshakes, broths, etc.)
- Hot tea, gentle movement after eating can reduce feelings of discomfort
- Happy baby yoga pose can help release gas and reduce bloating

Sluggishness:
- Remember that rest is important, even if it seems like you already rest a lot
- Gentle & joyful movement, if you are far along enough in recovery to incorporate that
- Check to make sure you aren't undereating
- Aromatherapy with mint or eucalyptus can help increase feelings of wakefulness


Hunger:
- Eat
- Please just eat

Edit: Please comment with any other common ED recovery complaints about physical discomfort and I will try to add to this post with more weight neutral tips.",1624393000.0
Intuitive eating struggles,3,o66got,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/o66got/intuitive_eating_struggles/,5,I’m really stuck. I’ve been trying to do IE for months I want to say since maybe January and I keep coming back to it but I’ve been really focused since March. My cues for hunger and fullness are totally messed up and I’m only seventeen. I have a bad habit of overeating. almost daily or just eating to eat and often times this leaves me feeling miserable and I know most people say that if you’re overeating than you’re restricting in some way but I don’t know how? I mean sure I have thoughts about food but it’s unrealistic for me to go out and get everything I think about I just start eating and I get the cue that I’m full but it’s like leaving something on my plate is taboo even though my parents never forced that on me and I have food in my house so nothing is limited which makes it even harder for me to understand why I keep putting myself through this same cycle. I know the food is there I see it so why do I keep eating when I’m full? As far as my hunger I don’t know if I would have such a problem recognizing it as much as I gave waiting for it if that makes sense? I know a lot of people say that thinking if food is a sign of hunger but I don’t think that’s reliable for me because I do get full quickly and easily even if my stomach is growling I guess I just want to rush the feeling so I can eat. I recently brought it up to my therapist and she recommended a food journal but I’m not sure what to write for it to be helpful some people says on a previous post of mine this could be harmful but I’m not really restrictive with my food intake. I read some of the book but it didn’t seem helpful to me maybe because of my age I just felt like it was more so chronic dieters which for me isn’t really the case I had one summer of calorie counting and a chronic dieter step mom.

About 10 years ago I found a “lifestyle change” that felt like it solved my problems with food. 

As it turns out, the restriction took me down a path of further disordered eating. Since the beginning of the pandemic I began exploring intuitive eating and found some peace. I also had a high stress job in social services and became crippled with depression and anxiety. 

Recently, I started a new antidepressant and I finally feel some joy in things again! It’s really exciting, I almost don’t even recognize myself. Anyway, this led me to make a homemade waffle cone with some ice cream and I was SO proud of myself. It was fun and tasty and didn’t make my stomach hurt. 

I posted in another subreddit focused on that lifestyle change that shall not be named and got slammed by someone commenting about the sugar content. It’s just so disheartening. I was looking for some encouragement and comradery. I deleted my post and won’t be posting there again. 

At the same time, I remember being that person that criticized others for their food choices. I wanted some sort of metal of honor for restricting but calling it “being healthy”

Treating protein-rich foods as safe foods is still giving in to the underlying logic of disordered eating! Protein is not a ""health food"" any more than any other foods are ""health foods""---they all have roles to play in an overall varied diet. Protein is a nutrient, not a panacea, and no amount of chicken breast is going to make up for depriving yourself of food if that's what the actual problem is. It's pretty deeply unhinged how often people (even those who claim to be practicing IE or whatever) hear someone say they're constantly hungry and jump to the mythology of ""more protein"" instead of starting with uhhhh eating enough food. 

I think marketing diet foods as high-protein was (in the US at least) initially part of a strategy to get men interested in wasting money on dieting the way women already were (""low-fat"" and ""low-cal"" labels being perceived as too feminine) but it's mutated out of control into this weird cult of fitness where people think if they don't work out a specific muscle group and eat a protein bar within 30 minutes their bodies will immediately start atrophying or (gasp!) putting on weight.

For the first time in my life, I’m having problems with overeating. Like today, I made myself breakfast, enjoyed it, and ate until I was very full. I recognized that I was full and stopped even though there was something left on my plate and saved it for later, which is good. 

But a few minutes later, I got that “must eat more!!!! Food is scarce if you can make yourself eat you better do it!!!” Feeling, despite being physically very full - if I would’ve ate anymore it would’ve been uncomfortable. I’m still having those urges and I can’t stop thinking about food. I’m trying to remind myself something like “you can eat as much as you want, the food will be there later”.

I also imagine there are probably people who can count calories/do keto/whatever without it taking over their life...I'm NOT in that category. And even if I could be in that category, I don't want to be, because what I'm doing is working for me.

Just as I don't run around evangelizing people who abstain from alcohol about the feasibility of moderate drinking (just think of the social benefits! Don't you want to toast your daughter's wedding?!) and offering them moderate drinking plans that worked for me ...I find it odd that people feel the need to tell diet abstainers about ""healthy"" weight loss methods. Yeah, we know about those. We've done that. We don't doubt that you and your cousin Betty both lost X amount of weight ""just by doing X simple things omg."" We're not interested. And frankly, we're usually nice about it but it's pretty rude to push diets on people knowing zero about their experience.",1622640121.0

on the other hand, it would be hypocritical for me to say you can’t lift weights if you have a past with an ed and it can be a very fun way to get active and see food as fuel (i literally do strength training myself).

my problems lies with the influencers who claim to have food freedom but still obviously label food as good and bad, track their food, weigh PEANUT BUTTER, are constantly moving, all ed stuff etc.

they say things like “yeah overate my macros yesterday but it’s going straight to my workout!” but…what if you overate and you…don’t workout as much? is that not ok? it kinda feels like a more friendly way to burn off food

it’s all the gaining weight is only ok if it’s muscle, it’s ok to eat a lot IF you move a lot, and thinking recovering from an ED just means being ok with eating more.

this might be me just being picky and somewhat disordered in my own thinking but weighting your food is not and should never be called “food freedom”",1622286428.0

I'm a longtime lurker and just created this account because I really love how supportive and helpful this community is. I've struggled with my weight and yo-yo dieting for a long time; won't get into numbers because they don't matter (and I fucking hate the BMI)!! But I recently turned 30, and just the idea of living like this for the rest of my life was enough of a smack in the face to get off the shitty diet train.

Aubrey Gordon's columns and podcast helped me a lot to get to this point. I really wanna read her book,  What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat, as well as the books mentioned in the sticky. I'm very much a beginner to this discipline. I was trying to find a book club that focuses on antidiet and weight stigma/fatphobia, but haven't been able to (at least online; I just moved to a new city and don't know anyone here yet, so maybe I'll have luck with a local bookstore. Honestly though, based on my experiences with weight stigma IRL and how pervasive it is, I don't have much hope). Does anyone have suggestions? Maybe a subreddit I missed or a virtual book club elsewhere on the internet?

EDIT: yall are great!! I've never organized a book club before but would love to jump into it with anyone here who's interested. Lemme mull it over a little—maybe creating a new subreddit would be the right move, so it doesn't clog up this space? My current thoughts are to have a poll to pick the book, and then maybe discussion leaders to come up with particular prompts/ideas? I've always done these in person or on Zoom, but I think there's a way to do it in an online/written format as well.

(Looking @ you Abbey Sharp)

In some ways it's even more harmful than stuff that's outright advocating dieting/weight loss, because people come to these misinformed sources thinking they're taking important steps toward recovery, and in reality they're being exposed to the same underlying logic but robbed of their ability to describe what's happening. Like these rich thin white women on Insta will really log on and make a post like ""yeah my intuition tells me to mindfully eat exactly 10 bites of lean protein at 2pm to break my intuitive fast, and I chew each bite 20 times to keep in touch with my hunger cues and that's how I maintain this definitely-not-suppressed weight, oh also I did an elimination diet on the advice of my holistic nutritionist and it turns out I'm intolerant to all forms of bread and refined sugar"" and people are like ""awesome! can't wait to emulate your extremely healthy relationship with food!""

I know Christy Harrison has talked about this as the ""wellness diet"" but I just feel like it's honestly getting worse every day. You can even see the language of IE/antidiet filtering into actual diet communities (including certain subreddits lol) but without any of the underlying conceptual shifts/critiques attached. Meanwhile weirdo basement denizens can't even handle the fake versions of antidiet concepts, and they conflate these extremely tepid takes with actual radical (good) positions, which just reinforces the misconceptions that the medium.com-industrial-complex is already pushing.

Um. I mean, I'm not going to fight the school board on this but like...if there's a goal of honoring cultural practices, haven't ALL human cultures since the beginning of time incorporated food into celebrations? Why does the school feel it needs to ""reduce"" this strong and beloved cultural association? It's pretty presumptuous to set up a common and beloved cultural practice like this as being in conflict with ""lifelong healthy habits.""

Personally, I remember fun halloween parties and things like that at school.. which, granted, not every kid celebrates halloween (and they would be excluded by ANY celebration, not just food-related). But like, it was fun to have a day of snacks in class. Couldn't we just say all celebration food has to be vegan and nut/peanut-free, so as not to exclude kids with allergy and religious restrictions?

self-care vs. grooming ourselves to look good for other people,65,n9y11q,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/n9y11q/selfcare_vs_grooming_ourselves_to_look_good_for/,25,"A lot of us have been taught that self-care means, essentially, grooming ourselves to look good for other people. Losing weight is the obvious example in this subreddit, but other examples might include, getting nails done, doing a skin regimen, treating hair with chemicals, putting makeup on skin, etc. ... all those things my mother told me I had to do every day as part of being a woman. Probably there are examples that people of other genders can relate to as well.

To me, these activities are only self-care if they bring us genuine pleasure (e.g., if we love the feel of a face mask on our skin, or enjoy the self-expression of putting on makeup just the way we like it). My best friend does a ton with her hair and makeup, for example ... she follows makeup channels on youtube and gets a kick out of learning different shading techniques and stuff like that ... which *does* seem like self-care to me.

But if we're doing these grooming behaviors not because we enjoy them, but because we think we're unacceptable/unattractive without them, then to me that's more self-harm than self-care. Because instead of challenging those harmful beliefs about our own acceptableness, we're just playing into them. I believe it goes hand in hand with antidiet to find ways to truly care for ourselves, and let go of false self ""care"" practices that are rooted in the belief that we're not enough.

So my questions for you all are:

(1) What do you consider part of your true self-care practice? Not necessarily grooming; could be anything. Mine would be laying off on booze (nothing inherently wrong with booze but I lay off when I want to stay present with my emotions), meditation, journaling, and giving myself a creative outlet (gardening).

(2) What behaviors did you once think of as self-care, that you either stopped doing or are considering letting go of, because you've realized they're more in the ""trying to make myself look good for other people"" category than the ""I really enjoy this life-affirming practice"" category? (Note that the same behavior could be true self-care for someone else and false self-care for you, if you're doing it because you think you're not worthy without it! It's not about the behavior itself!)

I am already at high risk of osteoporosis in old age, and having HA is the icing on the cake because if I am not menstruating, then my body is not producing estrogen, which is needed to raise bone mass density.

Balancing a vegan diet with intuitive eating?,12,mshcwo,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/mshcwo/balancing_a_vegan_diet_with_intuitive_eating/,6,"Hi! I’m new to this thread but have been a lifelong vegetarian (for ethical reasons) and have been anti-diet for a few years now. When I first started eating intuitively, I wasn’t able to simultaneously be vegan because I found it to be too restrictive. However, now that I’m more comfortable with intuitive eating, I’d like to start transitioning into and maintaining a vegan diet (insofar as that’s possible without falling into the trap of obsessing over ingredients lists, etc.). I care deeply about animal rights, and I’d like my eating patterns to be in line with my values. Does anyone have advice on how to balance ethical food choices with intuitive eating? Thanks in advance! :)",1618623310.0
Mindset change with antidiet & reimagining what is possible,59,ms6ewj,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ms6ewj/mindset_change_with_antidiet_reimagining_what_is/,28,"As I moderate this subreddit (which I love doing!) I find it so interesting the kinds of assumptions I see in posts that get removed. So many people seem to think the only alternative to dieting is eating everything that isn't nailed down forever. And it's like, first of all, no...that's not what happens. 

But also, like...from the ""outside"" (outside of diet culture) it seems so weird to even think that would be what would happen. Does that make sense? Like now that I'm at my set point, I think it would be as difficult to eat at a consistent caloric surplus in order to gain weight, as it would be to eat at a deficit and lose weight. I ran a half marathon and didn't lose a pound. I had a sedentary job for five years and didn't gain a pound. Things are in a balance, and it would take significant effort (and frankly violence) to knock myself out of balance in either direction. And I wouldn't want to do that.

But when you're in that binge/restrict pattern, all you can imagine is those two things. This is not to shame people who think that way because I'd be shaming myself, because this was all I could imagine for many, many years. But people look at antidiet, project all their worst fears about what would happen if they gave themselves freedom with food, and basically create an experience of hatred and fear for themselves over something they don't understand.

All of which is just human psychology 101. I'm sure I still make the same errors in reasoning about other things -- I don't think other people are bad for having those thoughts. But anyway, I think the reason I find it interesting is because it highlights how much my own mentality has changed. And also the sheer magnitude of what change is possible, that when we shift our mindset we can see alternatives that we literally were incapable of imagining before. And it also makes me so so so so grateful that I'm not in that trap anymore. At least not with dieting. Probably some other areas of my life that I still want to work on. I may have 99 problems but a diet is not one, and I thank the old gods and the new for that every day.

I don’t really go to doctors. But I’m about to be 26 and my insurance will change. I wanted a general check on things. Basic blood work. I’m not gonna say the exact reason but it wouldn’t have been connected to weight.  I went to a guy the nurse recommended in the college health center I always go to. I didn’t think much of them referring me to him and not my usual doctor, a female who shares my body type. I met him, I told him I was not there to talk about weight multiple times I just wanted to move on. Get the blood work done that I asked for. He continued to shame me. On my visit summary he put the reason I was there as what I said I was NOT there for. Literally lectured me on why I should do more of what I’m already doing that he thinks I’m not doing. All in all it felt pretty crushing and is deterring me from doc visits all together.

But I still need these results back and if they aren’t normal I’m sure I’ll need to go back. What do y’all do to vet a doctor? I’m planning to just have records sent elsewhere.

I did not naturally eat less, my snacks were bagels, large mugs of hot chocolate, and cookies and my dinner was often a bucket of fried chicken. 

I didn’t even realise how untrue it was until I began to recover and my mind was in a clear enough state to remember how I actually used to eat.

My boyfriend has told me a few times he wants to loose weight. I find this quite difficult and I don't know how to react to this. I am personally against diet-culture and don't want anything to do with it since I have struggled with disordered eating in the past and I don't wanna go there anymore because it was really unhealthy for me. Plus I love how my boyfriend looks and I don't want him to be insecure about his body.

I want to support my boyfriend in his decisions if he truly would feel better losing weight if it made him feel healthier, but I don't want to make him feel insecure about his appearance by contributing to his want to lose weight.

Long story short: what can I say to him thats encouraging but not making him insecure? How can I react? I have explained to him why I think diet culture SUCKS and he shouldn't participate in it, but if losing weight would make him feel healthier I do want to support him the best I can and not let him make the mistakes I did.

Physical Education classes and exercise feeling like a chore,43,ma06gy,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ma06gy/physical_education_classes_and_exercise_feeling/,14,"I've decided that it's more important for me to increase my activity level than restrict my food intake. I did low impact yoga for a few days, and enjoyed it, but had difficulty motivating myself to continue. The same has been true for walking around the neighborhood. Part of the issue I think is that PE classes were so competitive and high intensity, really only teaching me and my peers the value and the tools of things like running a mile in x amount of time, being able to do x amount of pushups and situps, and exercise not being effective unless you were pouring sweat and had a high heart rate. 

I want to be better to myself and do more activity not only to be physically healthier, but mentally too. I think recognizing that I faced pressure to only see hard exercise as worth doing in the past, and recognizing now that low intensity activity is better than none at all, will help. Part of the reason diets don't work is that unsustainable eating is often paired with unsustainable exercise. We're not naturally programmed to run unless it was in pursuit of a meal or running away from a danger. Our ancient ancestors weren't using ellipticals. Competition and body standards seem to be the only sustainable hard-workout motivations for most people today.

It's okay to just do light, gentle activity for fun. I'll clarify that I support anyone doing higher impact workouts and sports if it's what they enjoy. It's just that I don't think it's for most people, and doing a month of the gym, losing motivation, and quitting over and over is worse than just finding an activity that you find easy and enjoyable for your own stress relief that you can do sustainably.",1616343888.0

Okay so I was supposed to get married oct of 2020 and went wedding dress shopping in Feb of 2020. This was during the height of my IBS being a problem and me eating incredibly restrictively/trying fads to fix it which means I was smaller than now.

Anyway pandemic happens, cue weight gain. After this I finally let go of my other bs and join the anti diet side fully (I had been straddling the fence for a few years—you can guess overall I’m much happier and healthier now).

Anyway the point is, the dress is too small and new date is in sept. Which means I need to figure it out.  Anyway, I made an appt with a seamstress Monday and am planning to go and just say “can you make this fit me or not?” If not I’ll sell and get another dress. I’m like terrified I’ll have to find a new dress/get it altered in a few months but I’m more terrified that the seamstress/alterations person will say something along the lines of “you have x amount of time you can just do xyz to fit in this dress” and I’m worried that a comment like that will trigger me horribly. I really hope they can sew in a panel or change the back. If it’s expensive I can make it work I’m just so nervous. 

The other thing that is really triggering me is even if they fix it, okay, the idea of needing to be the same size predictably months from now is like freaking me out. Like it’s not about the fear of being larger so much as being consistent enough for this dress. I’ve unpacked a lot of what’s going on behind my brain and diet/wellness culture but this wedding and wearing a dress that has to be like picked and altered and whatever so long before is throwing me for a whole loop.

I guess if anybody reads this and can respond I’d love to hear that sizing a dress up a couple sizes is not impossible or just that it’s okay that my issues are coming back in ways I didn’t expect? I’ve done a lot of work but this makes me feel like I haven’t or that I’m still the same person stuck in the same warped mindset.",1615748415.0

Language Matters: How to communicate better,41,m4blk2,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/m4blk2/language_matters_how_to_communicate_better/,10,"So someone used some pretty upsetting language on my post the other day. And now that I’ve calmed down, I wanted to go back and do a better job of explaining why I was so upset. But they’ve since deleted their comments, so I thought I’d share with the community at large, in case this is helpful for anyone else. 

I helped facilitate a support group for a while, and this is what I’ve learned about how to communicate better with someone who’s struggling. 

**Use I Language**
Speak from your own experiences and don’t offer advice unless it’s specifically being asked for. If you really want to share something you think would be helpful, phrase it like “this is what worked for me” or “I was experiencing x,y,z and then I tried this and I felt better”. We use second person “you” so much, especially when we’re talking about any given person (or hypothetical person) rather than a specific individual. But when you’re the person on the receiving end of those comments, it can feel like people are specifically talking about you and telling you what to do. And that does not feel good. (I’m not sure how to say any of this without ‘you’ but this is intended to be a suggestion of something to be more mindful of rather than a command/rule.)

**Don’t “Should” on People**
Most of us should on ourselves enough as it is and don’t need that from someone else as well. Also should is a shame based word. Saying “I should do X” does not, in fact, actually help with accomplishing X. All it does is cause us to feel bad for not having done it yet. And we think making ourselves feel bad about not doing something will eventually motivate us to do it, but in reality it leads to avoiding the task for even longer. For self talk, I try to change it to “I want to do this” or “this is a goal for today”. And again, if I were trying to suggest something helpful to someone else I’d say something like “I noticed I feel a lot better when I do X.” 

**Be Careful with “Just”**
When someone says “oh, just do this” it implies that whatever they’re suggesting is easy. And while it might be easy for that person, it probably isn’t for the one who’s sharing about how hard something is for them. I struggled with a restrictive eating disorder for 12 years and so many people told me to “just eat” like that would solve all my problems. There is no “just” doing anything around food for me because my relationship to it is incredibly complicated, and throwing out some “just do it” one-liner completely misses that and shuts me down from exploring any further. 

**Validating someone else’s experience means so much more than trying to help them**
When people vent or share things they’re struggling with, often times what’s the most helpful is hearing that they’re not alone, hearing that other people relate to their experiences. And when we jump right into looking for solutions, we can skip that step. To me, it feels hollow to hear advice from someone who hasn’t taken the time to understand where I’m coming from. Like they see me as a broken thing that needs to be fixed as efficiently as possible so they can move on to the next problem. 

I noticed too that diet culture uses a lot of the language I’ve suggested against and maybe hearing it written out like this is helpful for spotting and addressing that.

"Keto is an ultra-restrictive deprivation regime, with a cult-like internet following. But the deeper you dig, you quickly discover that much like any diet - very few people can stick to it and avoid bananas or toast for life. No long-term scientific evidence, but hey, it sells diet books!",197,m2nhm8,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/m2nhm8/keto_is_an_ultrarestrictive_deprivation_regime/,117,"I don't want to name-and-shame anyone for participating in the keto diet culture/religion (unless they're the ones profiting from it). But I feel bad for those who fall for it.

I did too, for a while.

Keto is, by-and-large, a rebranding of Atkins diet with some small changes. The idea is that you eliminate almost all carbohydrates and sugars from your diet - no sweets, no bread, no pastries, no pasta, no corn, no potatoes. We're not talking about smaller amounts of these foods - it's **zero** potatoes and corn. It's also a big-nope of foods that are otherwise considered ""healthy"", like apples, bananas, mangoes, wholemeal bread etc.

Most keto dieters get a little bit of *trace* carbs from meat (without ketchup! It has sugar), mostly-green vegetables, eggs and a little bit of dairy.

When it comes to deprivation, **keto is an ultra-restrictive regime**. It also means that it's nearly impossible to eat anything you didn't cook yourself, because restaurant foods and supermarket foods almost always have carbs, for palatability. Even the (usually-overpriced) keto-branded supermarket foods are frowned upon in the keto community, for not passing certain purity tests and still not having a low enough carb count.

Most of the caloric intake comes from high-fat meats, which are described as more satiating. Some consume very small amounts of carb-substitute foods. I found these to be far less tasty. Most of the artificial sweeteners allowed in keto had a strong aftertaste, which I couldn't stand at all.

**The ""promise"" is that if you eliminate sugar and carbs, your insulin level will go down and the hunger will go away. How much of it is true? Probably not much**, not for most people who suffer from metabolic syndrome and genetic [leptin resistance](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/obesity-is-in-the-genes/). **Hunger is just not that simple**. I can assure you mine didn't go away. I had a sad bunless burger but fantasized about the bun still. And I'm not alone - despite looking under every rock, I was not able to find a single scientific research that proves keto people maintain the weight loss after five years or more.

\*\*\*

**What did I learn in my online investigation into keto?** I learned that Dr. Atkins himself died while overweight (a claim that's still disputed and it's unclear tbh). I learned that Gary Taubes, who wrote the initially convincing book ""The Case Against Sugar"", is not actually medical doctor and doesn't have any relevant training - he majored in physics rather, and worked as a journalist. When Dr. Stephan Guyenet, an obesity researcher and an actually-certified expert, debated Taubes on the Joe Rogan show, he contradicted many of the claims in the aforementioned sugar book. The conversation [turned heated very fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUAIwsdctek). It almost got to verbal violence.

**I also learned that most diet books don't get fact checked for scientific accuracy at all, by the way.** They sell well, some people might lose a small amount of weight temporarily, by obeying the creed that's printed in them - but eventually, you're gonna want that banana. I know I'd like a banana right now. One banana has 23 grams of carbs, which is 3 grams more than the daily intake allowed in strict keto. It'd be hard to squeeze it in your carb budget even if you're more lax, and deduct the fiber quantity.

I think there's a question that's not being asked here - even if the promise of health and a lower number on the scale was true, **would it be worth it?** **A lifetime of saying 'no' to a piece of toast?**

And that's assuming that it even works. I don't think it does. All I have is, admittedly, anecdotal evidence: lots of comments on the keto subreddit tell stories like **""I did keto and lost X kilograms last year, but eventually I fell off the wagon and gained it all back, so I'm gonna start again tomorrow""** etc. It reminded me of the famous quote about how insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results.

Comments/posts of people who had a negative keto experience, failed to lose a significant amount of weight before the hunger got to them etc, just get downvoted into oblivion and thus far less visible. That's the religion element - you have to accept the creed blindly with zero criticism, else you're silenced. **Keto heathens are invisible.**

\*\*\*

So are there ""success stories"" after several years? Some, I guess, but they're anecdotal. I watched a youtube channel of one nice American teacher named Ally, from the south, who lost more than half her body weight 4 years ago, thanks to keto. She seems honest, kind and open about her eating. Ally often invites her audience to her Walmart shopping trips.

When she did a ""what do I eat in a day"" video, **I was shocked at how little food she consumed:**

* Breakfast: 28 grams of crumbled gorgonzola cheese with nothing. Black coffee, no milk.
* Lunch: two turkey hot-dogs, bunless, with mustard. No side dish.
* Dinner: stir-fry chicken with soy sauce, cabbage, broccoli, cooked in olive oil. The ""dessert"" was a spoon of cream cheese, unsweetened.

**That's it. That's all she eats.** **This is borderline starvation IMHO.** And because she has to cook it all by herself (remember - bought foods have more carbs), she meal-preps on weekends, and eat the same foods every day for a week. No variety, no spontaneity. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for her, happy that she's one of the 5% who actually managed to keep weight down (but I didn't appreciate the factually-incorrect tone of ""if I can do it, anyone can"" that accompanied some of these videos, as well as the implication that those who don't - didn't try hard enough). She seems very happy and positive, and perhaps she can live a life like this without feeling deprived. But I suspect most reasonable people with excess weight just cannot.

Another YouTube channel I found features a very sweet couple, two married ladies from Australia who cook and recommend keto foods. The channel has been running for more than 3 years, so you can clearly see that one of them did keep the weight down - but the other regained most of it, if not all, back. She claims to stick to the diet despite the weight regain, because of the ""health benefits"" (again, no good scientific data supports this in the long-term - mostly because there aren't that many people who manage to stick to keto for years. For mice, at least, it did more harm than benefit: [https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00453.2013](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00453.2013)). I hope she's genuinely well and again, I don't want to ridicule anyone. But for her, it's obvious that this unfortunately, there are no good results, and **it's just a matter of adhering to a faith rather than applying results-based logic.**

I myself couldn't maintain this for too long. I quickly learned that even tomatoes and carrots have to be restricted in keto, because even veggies have carbs (even after subtracting the fiber). I was sick of weighing my cheese finding out the amount I craved was above my carb budget. I discovered that there's only so much bacon and eggs one can eat before you really get sick of it. And that I don't like the taste of meat that much.

**I'm now trying the whole ""accept the things you cannot change"" approach. And it involves bananas.**

Thanks for reading.

We see old people who fall all the time. I've also been diagnosed with a chronic illness and my definition of health has changed a lot in the past year. 

So as usual something about diet/exercise comes up while at work. I was like ""well, I don't need a 6 pack or a perfect body, I just don't want to be one of those old people who fall and end up in the hospital with a broken hip every year."" 

One of my co workers talks a fair amount about her body image and she chimed in like ""omg, I NEED a 6 pack but I'm sooooo lazy lol. I had 2 cinnamon rolls today. My stomach goes like [hand motion] this and I can't even climb the stairs without struggling to breathe. I got on the scale yesterday and it was the highest I've ever been. Like when did I get so fat? It said I weighed x!!! That's so huge!!!""

I kind of sat there for a second to figure out what to say next because I've been there. But the number she said was the exact amount I weigh (which I only know from recent doctors appointments) and I definitely have thin privilege. So I spoke up and I said ""that's how much I weigh."" 

She kind of back peddled a little. ""But you don't LOOK like you weigh x. How tall are you? Oh we're the same height...? Well I know it's not a lot but...it's the most I've weighed and it's only x amount from x amount which is huge!!"" 

Thankfully another co worker was nearby and had heard our conversation and she chimed in with how BMI is bullshit and talked a little bit about her sisters struggle with an eating disorder. Like, all 3 of us are thin but ""overweight"" according to our BMI. 

So I was like ""you know, you only think your weight matters because society tells you it does. It leads you to believe you can't be healthy or happy if you don't weigh [small number]. Plus, men in diet companies created our insecurities so they could make money"" I added somewhat sarcastically. 

Her face lit up like she had literally never heard that before. I wanted to send her more articles about body image stuff but I didn't want to cross a line. 

Anyway, I felt pretty good about the conversation and I wanted to share.",1615298375.0

Here’s a lecture where he talks about how our body naturally controls our weight (at around 10:45 in the vid)

[https://youtu.be/kNotqromxjQ?t=645](https://youtu.be/kNotqromxjQ?t=645)

>""If your weight is stable for a given year, during that same interval the amount of food you ate would have to be precisely balanced against the amount of energy you burn, and weight is remarkably stable year in and year out for people who are not actively trying to change their weight, quite naturally it just stays at the same place, and this has been shown in studies in South Africa, Sweden, Israel, and elsewhere.  
>  
>What this requires then, is over the course of a year in which you may have consumed a million calories, that would have had have been precisely balanced against a million calories burned.  These numbers get even more profound if you think about food consumption over the course of a decade, during which the average person will have consumed tons worth of fat, protein, and carbohydrate, converting that to waste, heat, and a small amount of work, all the while maintaining a relatively constant weight. Now if you take into account that in many cases there's a 10 pound weight gain per decade, if you do a back-of-the-envelope calculation with these massive numbers, what you conclude is that the number of calories taken in over the course of a decade were balanced precisely against the calories burned with approximately 99.6% precision. This is a level of precision that exceeds by logs the number of calories that a dietician could sort of surmises in the food you eat, and even exceeds the precision with which calorie counts are shown on food labels.""",1615150266.0

So I just told him the truth, that calories are energy. Which he likes having energy so now he's constantly reading the calorie labels trying to find the one with the most energy! I explained that he can read them if he wants but his tummy actually knows how much energy his body needs, so he doesn't have to read the labels because he'll be hungry when he needs more and full when he has enough.

I started not dieting towards the end of last year and overall I think I’ve been making better choices when it comes to food because I want to. However I’ve been gaining weight since I stopped dieting around 3-4 months ago and it makes me so stressed! Before I essentially used to just restrict myself, some days I’d only drink coffee and have a tiny dinner. Or energy drink/caffeine for a day and a half. Just always skipping meals etc. 

Now I don’t diet and I do feel better about food and I don’t feel guilty about eating or feel the need to restrict, but, some days I just feel so fat and ugly. I just don’t know what to do because it feels like I’ve been gaining weight nonstop and i will just keep gaining weight exponentially. I haven’t finished reading HAES because I’ve been finding it a bit dry honestly.

What do I do if a keep gaining weight? Do you have any advice? Is it normal to gain more initially and then go down to set point? Or if you just gained weight and stabilised how do you feel?

On the other hand my grandma was big to the point that if she fell over she couldn’t pick herself up and my mum was in the way there too. Mum had her stomach stapled because she didn’t want to have the same mobility issues. I worry if I don’t diet that I will be the same. It seems to be hereditary.

My grandpa doesn’t understand and claims to be “too old to change”, which is ok-ish as he isn’t really actively spewing diet culture. 

BUT everything in his house is like the diet swap for real food. And it’s so frustrating. Like I just want to eat satisfying food that’ll actually lead to feeling full, but everything I reach for has half of the stuff in it that I’m used to. I’m like why is there less food in this food? 

I do think part of the solution will be buying my own food, even if it means having duplicates of stuff that would make more sense to be communal. And then setting boundaries around things as they come up. Like today I said I need to go to the store alone because going with someone else is too overwhelming for me. 

My grandpa really doesn’t get boundaries though and doesn’t understand why he should have to change something about his behavior when I’m the one who’s upset by it. So I definitely don’t fight every fight, which is out of the norm for me and frustrating in its own way.

so I am diabetic (type 2, every single adult in my family has it - even the thin & “healthy” ones) 

I am finally addressing it, after avoiding it for years due to shame and guilt, feeling like if I’d just restricted more or exercised myself into exhaustion every day, I could’ve prevented this. 

My wife called me out today, because I was subconsciously “rewarding” myself for my sugars getting too low because it meant I wasn’t eating enough. 

I realized then that, in an effort to eat intuitively, I began to reject foods based on how they make me feel. However, I realized that what I was ACTUALLY doing was justifying food avoidance and NOT eating intuitively by rejecting food because it made me MENTALLY feel bad (example: not eating chocolate that I really wanted because it would make me feel bad EMOTIONALLY). 

So, in an effort to combat the restriction, I’m adding back some junk food into my house and allowing myself to eat when I want to eat, what I want to eat again. 

I’m really discouraged that I’ve backslid into restricting again. Anyone else here diabetic or otherwise reliant on dietary choices (like crohns or thyroid issues, etc) that have tips for not feeling shame or guilt?

“Weight Management” and Anti-diet,37,lnxgmj,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/lnxgmj/weight_management_and_antidiet/,42,"TRIGGER WARNING - references to BMI, EDs, and intentional weight loss. I am re-posting this to remove the word ob*se, although to be clear I only mean it in a fat-positive, medical diagnosis way. But I understand it’s against the rules, even if that is what I am and I try not to be ashamed to say it. 

Hi all, for anyone who is open to it, I’d like to discuss and seek advice for this very uncomfortable cross-section I am finding myself in: I am a recovered ED patient, intuitive eating practicer, and woman with a BMI of 40 whose doctors have recommended that I pursue intentional weight loss. There was a time not that long ago that even posting this would be too painful and embarrassing. But I want to be real with you (or as real as an anonymous posting platform can be) and seek your guidance. 

Background: My family genetics cause “high” BMI. My whole family is larger. I started my first diet at age 10, was entrenched in disordered eating behaviors throughout my teen years, diagnosed with EDNOS at 19 and had a short inpatient stay at a recovery facility. I relapsed a few times in college, including abusing phentermine/topiramate until I was hospitalized again, dragged kicking and screaming back to ED recovery. Throughout all of this, I didn’t consider myself to be “anorexic” because my BMI was in the “normal” category even at my lowest weight. This thinking was also reinforced by my care team, who would tell me that I didn’t meet the definition for anorexia because of my BMI. As I said, “high” BMI runs in my family and to even maintain a “normal” BMI, I have to starve myself. 

By 25 I would consider myself fully recovered from my ED. But at 27, my antidepressants stopped working and I hit a rough patch leading to suicidal thoughts and binging. I gained weight rapidly after recovery and further gained during this period of binging. Eventually I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder and entered an IOP program to learn how to cope without food as a crutch. 

I have not binged for almost two years. In terms of my relationship with food, it’s never been better. I practice intuitive eating. My relationship with my body is still pained, but closer to “neutral” than ever before. However, since leaving IOP and practicing intuitive eating, I have gained 30 pounds in two years. I knew I gained some weight just based on how my clothes fit, but I didn’t know that number until a month ago at my primary care doctors office. It is a difficult number for me to process. My BMI is 40. 

While my blood tests show that my health is very good right now and I explained to my doctor my HAES-approach, she is still concerned with the impact my size will have on my long term health. And honestly, so am I. I am a believer in anti-diet, HAES, intuitive eating, fuck diet culture - everything. But in truth I am very concerned that my weight will lead to health complications. I have now been referred to a “weight management” specialist. 

I saw her yesterday and am proud of how I handled the meeting. But the bottom line is this: if I am going to lose weight, I am going to have to reduce my calorie intake. I’m going to have to track my calories. I’m going to have to make different food choices. She also wants to prescribe me Saxenda which I am open to but not sold on yet. 

I want to continue my IE journey but that is in direct conflict with these realities. I feel stuck. I also feel like I am betraying my values - at the end of the day, this new plan would be a diet, and fuck the diet industry. As much as I try, I still can’t help but hear that ED voice: I failed at my eating disorder and now I’ve failed at intuitive eating. I can’t even maintain weight right. But I also want to lose weight - but also not give in to dieting pressures... I could go around in circles all day.  Even my therapist is at a loss for how best to approach this. I have appointments with my psychiatrist and another ED specialist soon to get other opinions. Both are doctors whose opinions I value. 

If you read this far, thank you for letting me vent. I would appreciate any comments, advice, and thoughts as I navigate these feelings.",1613789610.0

1. Most research is done on **mice**. They assume that humans have a lot in common with mice, which defies common sense to me.

2. **There are hardly ANY long term studies** on humans. The reason is that it’s insanely expensive. Asking people to report on what they eat or weigh their portions is difficult. There are so many social stigmas around food and eating. People just lie, and some just underestimate or overestimate their food intake. Serious studies that relate to nutrition are ones in which humans are locked in what Gary Taubes called a “**food prison**”, a closed environment where they can’t eat anything other than what’s served to them by the scientists. This is insanely expensive and naturally, cannot be done in long term studies. Eventually people have to go and live their lives, their real eating habits cannot be controlled and monitored. There are no good long term studies. 

3. If you watch old Seinfeld episodes from 25 years ago, they’re full of jokes about how red meat is bad for you. This was the scientific convention in the 90s, not so long ago. Eggs and meat were believed to be bad till very recently, and this has shifted as food trends changed. **Who’s to say the current dietary recommendations won’t change again** in a decade or two? 

4. On a personal level, I feel that **the science around obesity offered me nothing but accusing me for my condition**. If I can’t stick to a restrictive eating plan for years and years without getting hungry - it’s my fault for lacking self control, not the program or the science behind it. Blaming the victim is the easiest.

5. **All the skinny people who don’t eat the foods defined as ‘healthy’ by science**. I’ve a friend named Jason, who eats copious amounts of junk food. Tasty, delicious pastries, burgers with fries, deep fried chicken, ice cream, you name it. He’s never been to the gym. He weights way below the minimum BMI, and despite his best efforts to gain weight, with the aid of doctors and fatty shakes they usually give anorexic patients, he’s been failing miserably. Even during my lowest weight periods, when I was tracking my food and exercising 5 days a week - he could eat my daily calories in one meal. **I’m sure you all know a Jason or two. They exist.** I’ve never found a convincing scientific explanation as to why they can pull this off effortlessly, and I have to weigh my meals on a kitchen scale for the rest of my life - else I’m considered lazy, unhealthy, not taking care of myself etc. Most skinny people I know don’t eat the low calorie healthy foods dieticians told me to eat all these years - they don’t count calories, they don’t diet, they just eat.

"Demonization of sugar and ""processed"" foods in curriculum for young girls",32,lh1tzy,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/lh1tzy/demonization_of_sugar_and_processed_foods_in/,9,"Hello everyone! I am looking for some advice here. I am currently volunteering with a nation-wide organization by running a program that they design for grade 6 girls in school to teach them about things like self-confidence, making friends, and staying active (such a critical age for girls dropping out of sport!). I am all for those types of things, however, the program also has an emphasis on teaching about ""healthy eating"". Back in the pre-pandemic times, the material was a little bit left up to the mentors (aka me and my partner), so I generally avoided the healthy eating material they gave me and focused on other stuff. Maybe we'd share some of our favourite recipes and try some new foods together, but that was the extent of what I engaged in with the healthy eating portion of the program. 

Well. Now that this is online, they've really tightened up the curriculum for the mentors by giving us powerpoints to go through with the girls. I am preparing for this week and my stomach dropped at some of the things I'm supposed to show my mentees. The materials completely demonizes sugar (say that it causes acne, heart disease, weight gain, drains your energy etc.), and asks the girls to look at nutrition labels and be ""shocked"" at how much sugar is in ""processed"" food. It then goes on to tell them that they should be weary of ingredients they don't recognize and that they should eat mostly ""whole"" foods.

I, like many of you, found the HAES/IE/anti-diet movement through my recovery from an eating disorder. This material reminded me so much of the days when i was in the thick of my disordered eating and obsession with food.  I don't want to push this garbage on girls ever, let alone at such a crucial time in their development.

Why do all (most) nutrition apps need to be about weight loss?,48,l74eo5,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/l74eo5/why_do_all_most_nutrition_apps_need_to_be_about/,33,"These past few months this whole concept started bugging me. With Covid and lockdown happening, everyone's day to day lives has been impacted with major changes in all sort of aspects. We were forced to change our routines, stay away from friends and family, and our usual distractions were taken away from us - whether it was going to the pub with friends, the theatre, a cinema, art class, a run - whatever that was, we just could not do it anymore.

It's unsurprising that with a lack of outside, tangible distractions, in this day of technology, people resorted to online mediums - myself included. And next thing I realised, is this surge in fitness content that seemed to appear from everywhere, and *anyone* telling you what you should do to be healthy, and what you should eat to maintain a healthy lifestyle, how to not put up those kilos. For me, this caused actions that I now realised were all *but* healthy. And it therefore also does not come to a surprise these times were also characterised by a sudden surge in calls to mental health and eating disorders helplines. Is there a way to help?

There are a lot of (thankfully) good mental health apps around - Calm, Headspace and Sanvello just to name a couple - but when I started to looking into nutrition, I could not say the same - or at least, not in what I was looking for. Eating disorders are unfortunately a very complicated problem - that goes beyond my confidence in saying that this can be tackled completely through a digitised solution. But what about preventative solutions? What about disordered eating - what about those unhealthy food relationships that are still, hopefully, at a non dangerous stage? **Why does there not seem to be anything that wants to help teach someone about nutrition, and help them regain confidence around food and happiness around food? Why does there not seem to be anything that tries and heal the relationship between a person and food?**

Of the nutrition apps I have found while doing my research, I want to remove all the *calorie counting*apps. I am against them and I really think it's the wrong approach to nutrition. I think (at least from my personal level) that this can be one of the biggest ways to develop bad food relationship. It can become so easy to associate a low number with good, and a high number with bad - and this approach is *far away from healthy.* And also going through MyFitnessPal subreddits, I can confidently say that I am not the only one who thinks this.

On the other hand, I would like to highlight some apps I was not aware of, but which positively surprised me: Noom and Second Nature. What I liked about both is that they:

* aim at creating a *personalised* diet
* remove counting calories (although Noom associated colours to foods - green, yellow and red - and this could on itself be seen as good, meh and bad)
* have access to 1:1 coaches and chat group to support someone's journey (in the case of Second Nature they are registered dieticians and nutritionists. The fact that they are *registered* is to me an extra point towards them)

Furthermore, Second Nature also allows for:

* education of nutrition science
* in app journaling
* tracking sleep

And both of them try and push for a *behavioural change* within the individual. Which is a good and sustainable approach. **HOWEVER** they both tackle **weight loss**. In both cases the target is to help someone lose weight. And although this can be a path to increase someone's health for diseases such as diabetes and possibly other health related issues, **I think that branding weight loss as a goal is wrong.**

***Why do nutrition apps always need to be about weight loss?*** I have failed to find a solution that brings together nutrition and mindfulness, helping someone regain happiness around food, learning to appreciate it again - and because I have failed to find it, **it is something I am working on creating**. And I would like to ask you, what would be the best features you would like to have.

These are some I am envisioning right now:

* Assign a 1:1 coach - a registered dietician or nutritionist
* Mood diary and log - mood diary associated to foods eaten during the day, and just overall mood
* set yourself daily/weekly/monthly challenges - e.g. not weighing yourself for a week/month, eating that trigger food. Asking to reflect on your actions
* CBT inspired exercises

I would value any of your opinions!! These could be features you think would be useful, overall opinion if you would use anything solution of the sort, any professional I could contact etc

It helps that it is a virtual class - nobody is seeing me out of their peripheries. But also, if they do, what do they see? They just see me, kicking ass.

However, I want to get back into certain hobbies more (hiking, climbing, etc.) and totally lack the muscle to do it. I also know I will enjoy biking more and run less risk of injury while on rides/doing physical work if I have a stronger and more flexibile body (particularly my core and arms).

Had a Big Win Today,107,kyprnx,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/kyprnx/had_a_big_win_today/,8,"Just wanted to share a positive, anti-diet win I had today. Not food related, but weight gain related. 

So, like just about half the world, I gained some weight between March (the start of the pandemic & quarantine in the U.S.) and now. I’ve had periods of being really hard on myself for this and just not caring. However, the one thing I haven’t done which the old, “diet me” would have done is hop right back on WW (formerly Weight Watchers) the minute I tried on some clothing that was too tight or no longer fit.

I’m a bridesmaid in my friend’s wedding which was supposed to be in May, but was moved due to the pandemic. When we were first fitted for the bridesmaid dresses, I weighed at least 15-20 pounds less than I weigh now. 

This morning, I tried on the bridesmaid dress for the first time since March. It didn’t fit. I couldn’t fully zip it in the back. The old me would have cried, been devastated and immediately would have signed back up for WW again. Instead, I took the dress off, and texted a few friends asking if they knew of any good local tailors who could alter the dress for me. I didn’t feel mad, sad or upset at all. I felt fine. I have an easy solution, to get the dress altered and be comfortable instead of forcing myself to diet and restrict myself for the next 2 and a half months (her wedding has been moved to April) just to fit into a dress I’m going to wear for one day. 

I was really proud of myself and my reaction this morning, and wanted to share it with this community. It’s been a long, vicious cycle of suffering through and falling victim to diet culture so this was big win for me today. There is hope....don’t give up no matter how long it takes.",1610826110.0

He eats nothing but meat and cheese—no fruit, no vegetables, nothing. At first I wasn’t phased, I’ve been recovering from a pretty bad eating disorder since adolescence and told myself I wouldn’t get involved. He isn’t pushing it on me, so what’s the big deal?

I have concerns because he has an eating disorder as well that he refuses to meaningfully address, but still does this kind of stuff this time of year. He restricts, loses weight, then gains it all back and feels terrible about himself the rest of the year, and does not treat himself kindly. He knows my stance on dieting and I’ve set boundaries with talk of things he “can’t eat.” 

I’m just frustrated right now because he’s not having a great week and I wanted to do something special. I wanted to cook a nice dinner that we can both sit down and enjoy, because we work from home and don’t really get that time like we used to. 

And of course, he can’t because he only eats after x hours, not a single second earlier. And he’s doing this until MARCH. Which means we don’t get to share meals until then.

Basically I just need a rant, I’m pretty sad because I spent over a decade of my life skipping social events, gatherings, holidays, anything that had to do with eating outside of a certain time frame/restrictions. Not to mention his diet has been triggering and hard to deal with anyway because of my own past.

I know I’m being selfish, and it’s not about me but I can’t help but be frustrated because i want better for him than this toxic cycle.

Supporting Partners With Differing Pro/Anti-Diet Perspectives,8,ksfxlz,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ksfxlz/supporting_partners_with_differing_proantidiet/,7,"Hi all, apologies for the long post!

I (29F) am hoping for some advice on how to be there for my boyfriend (30M) as he attempts a strict diet to lose weight, having never challenged his thinking about diet culture.  As well, I would love to hear tips on best ways to start introducing somebody to antidiet culture, HAES and IE!

Background on me: chubby kid, well-intentioned mother who has her own complicated relationship with food introduced me to Weight Watchers and the idea of dieting + exercise as a means to ""work off"" food at a very young age, struggled with BED until my late-20s, went through years of therapy and still struggle occasionally but overall am in a very good place now.

Background on my BF: quit smoking 2 years ago and gained a lot of weight quite quickly (before I met him); he is at his heaviest and is very unhappy about his body.  His mom is also always trying to lose weight and constantly talks about how she will be going back on her diet tomorrow; very big believer in the idea that you're either dieting or you're having a ""cheat day"".  His dad skips meals frequently and believes in intense workouts; he believes anything less than a 60-90 minute workout ""isn't worth it"".  I should note that while he normally lives with roommates, during these covid-times he is primarily living with his parents at their house in the mountains.  

My BF has a 2021resolution to lose 80 pounds.  For reference, his doctors have all told him that he does need to lose weight for his health.  I have tried to gently steer him towards reframing this to be a focus on eating and movement for health and overall happiness, rather than weight loss, but he is not quite accepting of this idea (as I also was not in the beginning of my healing journey, years ago!).  For the last week, he has stopped drinking alcohol completely (previously drank 4-6 drinks a day), eating only ""diet"" foods that he admits taste bad and don't satisfy him, and has been working out daily (previously he didn't work out at all), to the point that yesterday when he really didn't feel like going to the gym, I could tell he was really beating himself up and trying to guilt himself into going, and he (somewhat jokingly) asked for my ""permission"" to skip the gym.

I have tried to start discussions surrounding dieting by phrasing things like ""for me, making smaller changes and focusing on how I'm feeling has more long-term success, what do you think?"", and he always responds by saying, ""no, it's not like that for me"".  I have also tried gently making suggestions; for example when he says he's hungry after he's eaten only vegetables for dinner, I suggest he have a bit more to eat and try to emphasize the ideas of health and happiness, and he disagrees (literally told me that health and happiness don't go together for him).

I realize that the conversation probably needs to start much further back; rather than addressing his current dieting behavior, start with a conversation about diet culture overall.   I have not yet shared my struggle with BED with him, and I think that would be a powerful starting point, but unfortunately we are long-distance right now and I would prefer this to be an in-person conversation, so it will have to wait until I see him next month.  In the meantime, how can I start to open the door and lay foundation for having some of these conversations?  Looking back on my life, I know that when I used to be in ""diet mode"", I'm not sure if there was anything anybody could have said to convince me that dieting and weight loss weren't the only paths to health and happiness; I had to discover this for myself, which like I mentioned, took years and a lot of work.

Also, how can I be a supportive partner to him, if I disagree with his diet and weight loss focus, and feel that he is not treating himself with the kindness and love he deserves?  I know he is being hard on himself right now, and I don't want be another voice in his head telling him that he's not doing something correctly, but I also don't want to encourage diet culture.

Thank you all for the advice, and I wish everybody health and happiness in 2021!",1610034629.0

This post is a critique of our flawed food, health and social services system, and how diet culture plays a large part in classism.

Please be kind to one another and don't make character assumptions.

EDIT 3 *** 
I'm seeing the most backlash around the comment that cheap foods are often low in nutritional value. Just eat beans, rice, frozen veg or grow your own, etc. And it bums me out a bit that this is the biggest point of contention.

 I didn't say it's impossible to get nutritious food for cheap, just that much of the wellness industry pushes for expensive ingredients, and that having a low income certainly affects our options and often food choices. There are a billion threads you could comment on to provide advice/hacks on thrifty eating, stress management, surviving poverty, self motivation and personal responsibility. I'm sure this is coming from a place of wanting to help but this doesn't address how inequality affects health outcomes which is kind of the whole point of this post. It kind of proves my point that we would much rather blame a person's health on laziness and assume they make bad choices than consider the bigger picture of what other factors may be at play.

Alright incoming rant.

One of the biggest things about diet culture and toxic nutrition and fitness gurus that boils my blood is the fact that everyone pushes the blame of health issues and ""obesity"" on individual choice.

""It's just calories in calories out!""

""You need to avoid processed foods, eat organic and read all labels""

""You're fat because you don't care about your health""

""We're sick because of all the junk food we eat""

""If you binge or eat when you aren't hungry you just lack discipline""

So we get a new diet every year. We're told to cut out GMOS, buy organic, and carefully consider where our food comes from. Expensive organic grocery stores pop up in gentrified areas like mushrooms.  Documentaries are dedicated to demonizing processed food and telling us we're killing ourselves. But no one seems to want to address the fact that stressful jobs, barely making a living wage, lack of healthcare access, and socioeconomics play massively on our health outcomes.


You can't buy fresh prepared food on foodstamps.

You can't see a dietitian or personal trainer if you can't afford healthcare.

If you grew up poor, or with parents that grew up poor, you were likely born into the mentality of food insecurity, always finishing your plate and eating as much as you could because you didn't know when food would be around again. 

If money is tight, you will buy the most food you can get for your dollar to feed your family, and I can guarantee that's not going to be organic quinoa and grass fed meats.

Diet culture is so fucking steeped in classism that we'd rather blame the most marginalized bodies and groups of people than consider fixing our health care, education, food production and wages to actually give people a fighting chance at taking care of themselves physically and mentally. 

Instead we build more Whole foods in rich neighborhoods, shame others for their food choices and size, and turn ""health"" into a virtue contest to brag about to our friends and family.

I don't even know how to direct this anger into something productive because it's such an ingrained, systemic problem. At the moment I'm just working on reading, researching, and trying to see if I can realistically help make change, but it feels like such a titanic machine of an industry to fight against.",1608351656.0
Sharing my experience with ED and IE,29,kf2j3f,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/kf2j3f/sharing_my_experience_with_ed_and_ie/,5,"Hi! I've been doing IE for a couple of months. I just wanted to share my experience because, well, it's not always easy to share this with family or friends.  


Weight stigma runs deep in my family. And it's always been there, in the back of my mind. I've never been overweight, some extra pounds here and there, always ""fit and eating healthy"" and for the past five years or so doing intermmitent fasting, or skipping breakfast as I called it. Yes, five years or more. Tracking calories and macros for years and years, I had a monthly checklist for the days where I would avoid eating bread or sugar. Tracking all the exercise, always more and more, 60 minutes a day was not enough, yoga was great but it couldn't replace exercise, I had to do it all in the same day... And I always said to myself, it's worth it, Im fit and not as thin as I'd like to, but I'll get there. Of course, after fasting I would always be starving and eating a big meal, and then feeling tired and bloated (Just writing this makes me cringe at how bad my ED was, even though I looked wonderful and healthy)

Until at beggining of the year, a friend said to me ""Is it mean to tell you that you've gained weight?"", ""It's... unnecesary"" I answered. But it stick to my mind. I gained weight. I was doing everything ""right"". And I gained weight. And the thought was always there. Until one day I thought to myself, ""why does this affect me so much?"". And then I started a whole process to rid myself of those thoughts. I was tired of never being ""enough"", most of all, I was tired of the guilt food brought me. I wanted to enjoy food, I wanted to stop feeling guilty about food.

Fist step, delete all calories counting apps. Then, delete the ""thou shall not eat"" list. Then I started learning about IE, reading many books, and I thought, yes, I want to get rid of the guilt and the obsession. I stopped working out due to a bad ankle, and it helped me to stop the obsessive thoughts about exercise, and to learn that it's ok if one day I don't exercise because I don't feel like it.

I have to add, I had covid with lesser symptoms, just loss of smell. And when I got my sense of smell back, I realized I missed enjoying food, and I want to enjoy what I eat, never again eat something just because I should, or setting rules to feel like  I can ""control"" my body and life. After all, what are all those rules and diet plans if not just an illusion of control.

So now, I've gained some weight, and I'm still struggling with that, mostly with my belly, I'm trying to be neutral about it: I might not love my belly, but I remind myself it's just a belly, a part of my body. A body I'm learning to trust.

But I feel fine. I don't want to go back to all that obsessive controlling mind, some days I struggle a bit more than others, but I don't want to feel guilty anymore around food. And I effing enjoy breakfast in the morning now. That's a win in my checklist.",1608228134.0

For example, I was eating breakfast and realized that some of the fruit was underripe and didn't feel like having that bit anymore, and that I had put out more food than I would have liked. However, I feel guilty because I left just a couple bites of food (not enough to save so it feels like it's going to waste) and a handful of berries that I didn't enjoy eating. How do I get around feeling guilty about this?

Another thing is guilt surrounding ingredients. Some days certain things are more nourishing and I crave those more, but that means fresh stuff in my fridge will go bad if I don't feel like eating it in time and am responding to my body's signals instead of cooking based on what veg will go bad first. 

Sorry, this feels like such a silly post but I just can't find a way around listening to my body while also not wasting food. Technically I could compost but it might end up being a bit more trouble than it's worth in my area.

edit: thanks to everyone who responded!! i'll probably start a compost container to take to a church near me with a larger compost pile every week, and focus on learning to repurpose stuff i don't love into different dishes. i think part of my antidiet journey will probably be more environmentally inclined to minimize food waste while loving myself and my needs",1607617742.0

How do I maintain client's autonomy as a personal trainer while staying aligned with the anti-diet movement?,16,jzrvpv,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/jzrvpv/how_do_i_maintain_clients_autonomy_as_a_personal/,10,"Hello everyone!

As I bit of background on myself, I'm a (28)F personal trainer/certified nutrition coach who runs their own business.  Pushing weightloss was something I never felt comfortable with, nor did I like the idea of policing diets or pushing the latest fads. Working out for strength and enjoyment was something that really helped with my mental health, and I went into personal training with the purpose of wanting to share this with others.

When I started training clients, I was really sad to learn that many of their experiences with personal trainers were not positive. Trainers that pushed diets, trainers that made them feel guilty for eating the wrong things, critiques of lifestyle choices etc. I am firmly in the camp of gently encouraging intuitive eating, teaching safe exercise techniques, improving mobility and flexibility, and finding ways that work with a client's lifestyle to enjoy exercise. Christy Harrison's Anti-Diet was eye opening for me, and I've continued to read, listen to podcasts, and learn as much as I can about the dangers of diet culture and its profound effects on us.

Now here's where I am getting stuck. Above all, I value my client's autonomy. Their ability to choose to train with me, to choose what they eat, and make their own decisions about their health and what's best for them. I try to find non-pushy ways to address diet culture and body image, avoid weight talk, and track progress with metrics such as increased strength and energy. Thing is, there are still clients who really want to lose weight. 

And as a trainer, of course that's something I have the ability to teach. As someone who's privileged to live in a smaller body, I feel like a fraud sometimes telling people it's not something they should care about. If someone has all the resources and information on the dangers of diet culture and is working out because they want to, and they STILL are keen on losing weight, how should I approach this? I feel like I'd be gatekeeping/ taking away their autonomy by refusing to give them tools for weightloss if it truly is an informed choice on their part. 

With myself as an example, while I don't calorie count or restrict my diet, I do like the aspect of training where I see my muscles grow and get stronger, it's something that makes me happy.  I feel like I have the self awareness and knowledge to judge if it was becoming obsessive or unhealthy for me. But even that causes me guilt as I know some anti-dieters are completely against exercise for the purpose of shaping the body, even if it's for growth or weight gain.

I'm new to intuitive eating and have been working to try and catch myself when I'm falling into self-loathing/diet mind-traps that I've been wrestling with since I was 7 years old. Essentially, I trust the process of intuitive eating and know that it's a matter of practice to reduce the power these diet mindset have on me. One thing I'm really struggling with, however, is how to genuinely trust myself to recognize what foods I want, to note hunger/fullness cues, etc. and feel like I'm not tricking myself to be mindful.

If I'm consciously aware that I'm re-framing something (for example, ""I am engaging in movement because it makes me feel happy"", as opposed to ""I am engaging in movement because it makes me feel happy but also a small part of me hopes it might help me get 'fitter'.""), I feel like I'm tricking myself as opposed to being fully honest. The thing is, when I catch myself linking movement to my past relationship with it as something for weight-loss, I *do* talk myself out of that thought process. But, I guess it's the awareness that I'm re-framing it that frustrates me. Is it just something that's a matter of time for me to be able to get directly to the IE framing of eating and movement, as opposed to the multi-step process I find myself in now?

I am livid!  This one is emotional as I have family in Mexico But aside from the rage I am also very scared and feeling a lot of   despair.

I have been following the activities of the govt. of Mexico, who have launched several fatphobic campaigns and how it is constantly sending horrible fatphobic messages since the pandemic started.  
Basically blaming deaths on the dead people because well of course they died, they were fat.  
With zero responsability of anything, their pandemic handling strategy has been to blame fat people.

Since the pandemic started several official situations have been approved:  
\-Stores are banned from selling “junk” food and sodas to children, anyone that does can face up to 5 years in prison.

\-Parents cannot buy candy, or sodas, or fast food for children in public spaces, if they do they face social services investigating them.

\-Every single packaged food now has huge octagon labels all over it, with “excess calories” “excess sodium” “excess carbs” etc, plastered on them.  
People have now seen those labels in SALADS, frozen veggies, edamames, it is terrorism.

\-Fat people have been banned from entering certain spaces because “high risk” population.  
And many are being layed off from work unless they lose weight.

\-The education board now made it obligatory to have 2 hours of “health” class a month, where teachers with ZERO nutrition training teach kids how awful food is and how horrible and deadly being fat is.

And every single day the health secretary has a COVID-19 briefing where he blames fat people for dying.

And that's just the tip of it!! A government made “comic strip” was released.  
With horrible horrible language, called “What are you eating?” Except the eating was substituted by a very vulgar and demeaning expression, that would probably translate more or less like “What are you pounding down, or What are you pigging out on” something along those very awful lines.

  
And the drawings are every bit as horrible and awful and violent as you can imagine, showing a thin person eating “healthy” and a fat person with tons of fast food and such. Of course the thin person is all nice and put together and the fat person a slob.

  
People of course, are becoming much more vocal and open and violent with their fatphobia.  
And they are creating a generation that will grow up to have terrible severe eating disorders.

If you want to read some news about the country or the world, you have to scroll past several fatphobic messages, or if you turn on the TV there are fatphobic government offical commercials, and of course anyone you talk to is talking about dieting and how awful it is that fat people exist, etc etc etc.

How can anyone survive with a somewhat healthy emotional and mental state, when they are being terrorized and attacked in a very violent way, every single day by the government and the general population.

I want to scream, I want to burn everything to the ground, I want to cry, I want to curl up into a ball and get under the bed.  
I fear for the upcoming repercussions this will have on people that are not thin.

Cue to her telling and reminding me the energy content of everything. Saying there is “bad food.” I was literally just eating pasta last night and she started demonizing carbs and calling them >!fattening!< so I started affirming to myself and her that they aren’t bad. She basically laughed me out of the room.

She knows I’m recovering, which hurts a great deal. Even my doc told her to knock it off, but she doesn’t. Everyone assumes I’m their damn weight loss dietician even when I said I just want to be happy and not consumed in my own fucking BS.

Sorry for the rant, but does anyone have any advice? My father and her both fatshame everyone and her constantly, which doesn’t help my self image (she’s only a bit larger than me, but I’m a few inches taller). It’s definitely not making me feel good at all, and it makes it hard to reject the diet mentality.

So.. has anyone gone through anything similar..? :(",1603895341.0

So I ended up in a convo about intermittent fasting today. I wanted to be tactful and not judgy but also don’t want to encourage. 

Anyway I said for me personally when I did intermittent fasting, it caused me a lot of digestive issues, which is true. But then the convo went into fasting and people who fast for longer and how good it is for you etc... and like I knew something about how fasting for long periods of time isn’t great for the body long term and said that and she told me it’s great for you and she’s read all these books and I guess I wasn’t ready for the situation.

Honestly that and the following conversation were super triggering for me and id like to be more prepared so if anything does know anything about this I wouldn’t mind guidance toward some studies about fasting or whatever because I really remember hearing that long term it’s not great. 

Also just on another note. Sometimes I feel weird engaging with people because when diet talk comes up I don’t know what to say anymore. It’s like such a bonding thing for so many people and like obviously I don’t want to engage but also sometimes I wish it could just go away and it didn’t seem like it crept up everywhere.",1603803346.0

What I thought was a simple diet turned into a hell-hole of disordered eating and restriction. From CICO to IF, I realize now I was just starving myself then it all came back to bite when a trigger came up.

I literally brought myself from a point of being a nearly ""healthy weight"" to deprived of everything in just the course of the summer. But I was healthy when I was my old weight. I ate what I wanted, was very active, good muscle structure and not a frill weak shell that I am now.

Fuck that, no more diet culture. I'll instead do what's natural, listen to my body when it's actually hungry, not tell it that it can't have something because some celebrity or society said so.

Everything is fair game now.

You guys I don’t care about food anymore. It’s so peaceful and gentle. Like what? I don’t weigh myself, I’m eating exactly what’s right for me, and I feel free.

My bulimia started when I was 12 after a doctor told me not to gain anymore weight and start “watching what I’m eating”. Then started my lifelong battle with my body. Treatment/therapy/meds nothing helped until I read TFID and watched Stephanie Buttermore. And I’m free.

Antidiet thinking has been the only thing that’s every helped my binge eating.,87,jcf4hd,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/jcf4hd/antidiet_thinking_has_been_the_only_thing_thats/,7,"I struggle with the whole antidiet thing because on the one hand, it’s 100% true that diets don’t work, but on the other hand fat bias is real and it’s very hard to give up on the idea of being thin. 

About a month ago, I was going through a stressful time. It was essentially unrelated to weight, but I did have to stay with my mom for 2 weeks...and she’s a bit crazy in general. She’s also weird about food...she has tons of food in her house, just not anything that would be helpful in actually making a meal. And she has so much stuff that it’s difficult to cook anything. 

After about 2 days, I went the the grocery store. I was so hungry and I ended up in the cookie aisle. I never buy cookies because I bake and homemade is sooo much better, but I bought a huge bag of those frosted circus animal cookies. I hadn’t eaten them since I was a little kid. 

I got to the car and immediately opened the bag and started shoving them into my mouth from stress and hunger. I ate a bunch.  I don’t think the exact amount really matters.

But after a bit, I noticed that the cookies were just...meh. They just didn’t taste all that good anymore?  They were okay. Normally in binge mindset, I’d just finish the as much as I could anyway and throw away what I didn’t eat. Instead, I thought to myself, “These are just cookies. They are available at every grocery store. I can have these *whenever I fucking want.* I’ll just close up the bag and and have more *when I fucking want to* which might be tomorrow. It might be a week. It might be *in 10 effing minutes*!

I finished the bag on my own schedule. 😎

Similar things have been happening to me a lot lately. My husband wanted to get donuts. I don’t even really like donuts, but they do look and smell good when I’m in the shop. I was tempted to get many, many donuts and wondering how many I could order without my husband commenting. Instead I thought, “I don’t even really like donuts. They look good, but are always disappointing to me. I will order one donut and eat it. If I want more, I will just go buy more donuts.” I bought one donut and didn’t even like it. I threw half away. I did have my husband take me to my favorite burrito place for lunch since breakfast was a bust. 

My mom was very controlling about food when I was growing up, so I’ve always had the mindset that I had to eat everything while I had the opportunity. I feel like I’ve finally have the epiphany that food isn’t a scarce resource for me.",1602872296.0

I first politely commented asking her to listen to fat activists and acknowledge her thin privilege and not post content that creates an image of fat bodies as a before. She ignored it. I commented again asking why. She deleted my comments and blocked me.   
I tried to engage with her over DMs, mostly because even if it doesn’t sink in now, I hope one day it does. It did not go well.

I’m tired of seeing people with “good intentions” but harmful actions be celebrated for helping some thin people feel less shitty about their minimal fat. Meanwhile the provider makes a living off of it, charging $250 for a course on food freedom. 

  
I’m tired of thin people building a whole brand for themselves of food freedom and being “anti diet” and then continuing to cause harm to fat folks. I’d rather just know you’re fatphobic outright. I don’t want to play a guessing game of who’s the actual fat positive dietitian among the fat phobic ones on Instagram.

  
I could go on, but I have more important things to do. I just thought I’d share this with the community. I’m feeling alone in a fight to protect other vulnerable people who might follow her and similar accounts.

As it turns out, those belvita cookies are actually really good (I avoided them for a while because I thought they were diet-y) and I've been having a pack most afternoons with some tea. I've also been making those oatmeal packets that have added sugar and adding sugar to my coffee. 

And you know what? It turns out no one actually gives a shit what I eat or how much. No one has asked me why my oatmeal has sugar or why I'm eating cookies. Sometimes my lunch doesn't have any vegetables and no one asks why.

I need to rant for a second...,7,j8lg4k,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/j8lg4k/i_need_to_rant_for_a_second/,4,"Hello,

I have really enjoyed reading through this reddit as I am in the beginning stages of giving up dieting. I have realized that every time I feel stressed or overwhelmed I stress about food and want to track calories and I am just working on that not being a trigger for me anymore, and just to enjoy my life.

Well, I broke down this morning since I woke up and was bloated since it is that time of the month. I work on computers at home, so I find myself wondering onto the noom site after searching about calorie tracking. I got roped in to filling out their questionnaire and the entire time they are building you up and making you feel good about being there. They give you all this data about how many people have been successful and these medical journal claims. They rope you in further by saying ""In light of recent global events, we have allowed people to start for less than $1."" and then once you go through and put in your preferred payment method for your trial, it THEN tells you that at then end of the trial that you will be AUTOMATICALLY charged for 7 month membership which is \~$160. Then it will charge you the same amount every 7 months after. 

What is a little upsetting is the way they sneak such a large payment in and don't give you any options but the 7 month membership. Cheaper options such as MFP at least allows you to pay monthly.

I don't know why that rubbed me the wrong way but it just gave me a huge slap in the face before I closed out the tab. That is a huge amount of money to expect from someone, especially when you claim that ""in the light of current events in the world"" you are allowing people a cheaper trial and then spring the payment terms on them after they enter the payment information. Yes, of course that is why you read the fine print... but that is still super shifty. 

If that doesn't reinforce that the diet and ""wellness"" industries are out for you money and care nothing about you, I don't know what will.",1602340306.0

Some positive words,2,j6j5h8,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/j6j5h8/some_positive_words/,0,"I want to preface this post with some thoughts about my journey with food:

From a very early age (8), I considered myself “fat”. This damaging mindset continued into my teen years, when I started experimenting with dieting. Keep in mind, as a teenager I was only a couple of pounds over what was considered “ideal” for my age and height. I was extremely healthy- rarely got sick. Years later, up until now, I tried infinite amounts of fad diets. I am now the biggest weight I’ve ever been, probably because I put my body through extreme calorie restriction periods and consistent intense workouts.

I have damaged my body so much that it makes me so sad and honestly I want to apologize to my body for not taking good care of it and appreciating the amazing things it allows me to do! Everyday I am feeling even more comfortable in my body and thankful for so many things.

I’m not particularly religious or identify with a certain religion but I am slightly spiritual. I came across some quotes that really resonated with me in terms of finding peace with food and your body. Appreciating the opportunity we have everyday to enjoy great food and move joyfully.

Here are the quotes I found really enlightening: 

“It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”

“Who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving...”

““Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?...”",1602039027.0

So now I’m back to taking my temperature every day and feeling better so far (as long as I’m keeping it up). I’ve brought my period back to a healthier place with this method and many other things, like anxiety, which I also realized returned with me not eating enough. This is especially helpful in my case due to habituating an eating disorder, making it too easy for me to eat too little of an amount “naturally”. 
I will also note for anyone that might happen to research Matt that he has evolved his opinion on “health” constantly, ending at the conclusion that our body knows exactly what we want/ need and we shouldn’t fear food and in fact that very concept is likely the cause of societal health issues were seeing today.",1601853060.0

Another two are doing WW, another is doing some bullshit diet (the name is protein something...can’t remember the commercial name) where they send you pre-made, packaged crap (she previously did Jenny Craig too) and another, while she isn’t on one specific diet, is always trying to “be good” with food and is talking about WW approved recipes (again, she doesn’t follow WW but tries to only eat zero point foods I guess).

I should state that I really do like these women and they’re wonderful people and coworkers.

My favorite recipes are perpetuating diet culture,8,j2btth,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/j2btth/my_favorite_recipes_are_perpetuating_diet_culture/,7,"So I'm not an exceptional cook, but I do like to cook and my husband and I like to find new recipes all the time.

Anyway, the place I get 90%+ of my recipes from is SkinnyTaste. The name alone is obviously problematic, but the recipes are really excellent.

The problem is....well it's called SKINNYTASTE.

Managing Health Issues Typically Prescribed with “Weight Loss”,24,j0dgn9,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/j0dgn9/managing_health_issues_typically_prescribed_with/,21,"Hi all! I recently had some massive blood work ups done. I would’ve put money on having a thyroid dysfunction, surprisingly I did not. Despite (basically my entire life) running on low battery life in the parlance of our times (I’m a 40-something y/o woman but have had fatigue and lethargy issues since I was a child). 

I was, however, diagnosed with “elevated” blood pressure (“higher” than what is considered “normal” but high enough that I can turn it around, given my family history of HBP and heart issues) and having blood sugar numbers that are considered “prediabetic” (also a family history issue).

Now, while my doc is not a full on “HAES” physician, she was respectful of my boundaries surrounding weight loss (history of restrictive disordered eating patterns), and gave me tips on “eating fruits veggies and grains coupled with healthy movement” (all philosophies prescribed by anti diet or IE platforms!), I was given a sleep specialist referral for sleep apnea...something I’m also sure may have contributed to my lethargic energy levels since I was a child.  But everything I’ve done research on suggests “losing weight.” So naturally I’m a little frustrated by the limitations of the medical Establishment here!

I was always considered “healthy weight” as a child, and I doubt anyone would have told me to “lose weight” then if I had been diagnosed with these issues then.

However, the implicit language is there: “maintaining a ‘’healthy weight’” etc. 

So my question would be to anyone here with this experience: what other proactive methods can I subscribe to without restricting since I know this is triggering and potentially dangerous for me regarding these ailments. Namely: HBP, prediabetes, sleep apnea?",1601152984.0

I've also gained quite a bit of weight, and while I am still a bit nervous about it, I realize that I'm way more happier than I was when I was sick.

So like a lot of you, I’ve struggled with bouts of eating disorders, dieting, and an unhealthy relationship with how I view food, exercise, and my body. I’m currently trying to get myself out of one of these bouts right now, and I did something really small, but really awesome to help me move forward: I left a weight loss subreddit!

I’m done trying to make myself a part of a community that normalizes such a messed up way of looking at food and body size. I’ve let myself get brainwashed and sucked in, but I know intuitively how backwards and sideways their thinking is.

I still need to work on building a better relationship with food and my body still outside of that. I feel like it might take me some time to stop tracking my food, but I want to eventually get back to a point where I can live around food more freely. No more feeling guilty about enjoying more food on my birthday and special occasions, no more fasting just because I ate over my “limit” earlier on in the day, no more ignoring my hunger cues for the sake of not “going over” on calories. It’ll be a gradual journey, but I hope I get there. Today, I think I did something good to start.",1600472374.0

Another segment where she randomly generates a county and makes a meal based off what they eat there. She also generally posts about metal health stuff!

Over the past 6 months it has been a battle, let me tell you. So I’ve always struggled with my eating habits anyway, but I’ve always just subconsciously eaten whatever right? At the start of lockdown like everyone else I was like ‘okay it’s time to sort my weight out and hit those goals’ 6 months later and I am the embodiment of a couch potato and I’ve put on weight. How?

Well, I was trying to loose weight which in turn made me very conscious of what I was eating, trying diets, trying to eat healthy, I had fallen into the vicious cycle of binge eating.. so in my head if I had failed my diet one day I thought ‘fuck it might aswell eat bad for the rest of the day’ (btw ‘failing’ my diet was because I had a piece of bread and wasn’t carb free...!!!) so because I ‘failed’ I’d order takeaway.. lots of takeaways.. and go to the store buy so much shit and just eat it. Now. After the first day of this it would last for about 2 weeks. Everyday. Takeaway, junk food, fizzy pop. I don’t even want to think about what I consumed because ew. But THEN I’ve become addicted... like I genuinely can’t stop ordering food and I’ve fallen into a vicious cycle that I don’t know how to get out of..

I can honestly say it is the biggest challenge to go one day without a takeaway and junk food.. I don’t cook anymore, in my head if I’m going to eat toast which in the diet world is considered bad I might aswell just have an XXL pizza right? 

Honestly the diet community has fucked my eating habits up so bad, so many rules and different things to follow it’s driven me crazy and I’ve picked up the worst eating habits.

Before I could eat toast with butter without feeling guilty and feel like I’ve failed so I may aswell have a takeout..

I’ve been trying to get out of this cycle but now that I see every food that isn’t a salad as ‘bad’ it’s difficult. Honestly, reading into weight loss was the worst thing I ever did because there are SO many ideas and theories out there and SO many different diets to follow that it’s just sent me into a spiral and I’ve ended up putting on weight.

So I let out a breath and stopped sucking in, and guess what I looked exactly the same because at my age sucking your gut in doesn't make much difference anyways. But I was able to relax and enjoy my ice cream.

P.s we are a school full of girls and a concerning about have EDs 


Feeding

A lot of the food available to us nowadays is highly processed and high in calories. Increasing people are eating more than they need and as a result become overweight. Many will try to reverse this by dieting, but unfortunately 95% of them will revert back to their previous eating habits.

The Blue Zone communities do not eat too much and they do not go on diets. They eat fresh, unprocessed, local produce, made mainly of plants.
Essentially, they avoid food that is old, has been messed about with or has travelled long distances. They do eat sugary treats, but only on special occasions like birthdays or Christmas. They like sitting down to eat their meals with their family and their last meal of the day is often the smallest and eaten quite early.
Try any or all of these to establish a good relationship with your food.

Eat less sugar.

Sugar is highly addictive, the more you eat, the more you crave.
In the past when we were hunter gatherers, the desire to eat sugary foods helped us to store energy. Now we are constantly surrounded by sugary foods this craving can make us consume too much, and lead to health issues like obesity and diabetes. Sugar is hiding everywhere and many foods contain more sugar than you would think, for example low-fat yogurt, ketchup and fruit juice. Getting to know how much sugar is in food is the first step in eating less, so it is well worth reading the nutritional information on food packaging. Over time, small steps can actually make a big difference, try not having sugar in your tea or eating two biscuits rather than four.

Narrow your feeding window.

Try to limit the total window of time in the day during which you will eat. Make sure you have breakfast in the morning and then avoid snacking after your evening meal. This will help provide your body with the time needed for the repair and maintenance of your cells, as well as for burning up excess fat.

Avoid foods with lots of ingredients

Much of the food we eat is processed to make it sweeter, to last longer and to look and taste more appealing. These highly refined foods are regarded by some experts as low quality food and may cause a number of inflammatory diseases. Try to favour foods that have fewer ingredients in them, and closely resemble their original state. Chicken that looks like chicken and potato that looks like potato.

Drink lots of water

Two thirds of our bodies are made of water so it is not surprising that if you become dehydrated, your body will not work as well. This may cause headaches, tiredness and dry skin. It is best to try to drink at least a litre of nice clear water a day. Drink it before meals, after meals or during the day, whenever you prefer. You can tell if you are hydrated because your urine will be light yellow to clear in colour!


Moving

Whilst it is common knowledge that exercise has a whole range of health benefits we now move around much less than we did in the past.
We use cars for the shortest of journeys, many jobs are sedentary and our most popular forms of entertainment involve sitting down in front of a screen. In addition, we have cleverly invented a range of machines to reduce the need for manual effort, like leaf blowers so we don’t have to sweep or food processors so we don’t have to stir. It certainly makes life easier, but it means we have massively reduced our daily physical effort compared with our grandparents. It is not unusual for many people to go all week without breaking into a sweat from physical activity.
To counter this, many people schedule in sessions of intense exercise like a gym workout or a run. Once done, they feel that their quota of physical exercise is complete and go back to sedentary ways for the rest of the week. The problem is that, just like diets, it is hard to keep these sessions going and often they are not frequent
or prolonged enough for the weight loss people hope for. On the other hand, overdoing it can cause injury or exhaustion which results in no physical activity at all!

Blue Zone people do not go to the gym or run marathons, their exercise comes from the movement involved in their daily lives. They will walk to most places and they use the stairs. They will do household chores by hand and they will dig, hoe, weed and harvest their gardens. Many of them have jobs that require physical effort like farming or labouring. They do not sit down for very long.
If you are not currently involved in regular exercise you could follow their lead by walking to school (if possible), to the shops or to your friends and by always using the stairs instead of the lifts or escalator. Get involved in clubs and activities like gardening that require movement. Use dead time during the day, like when you are waiting for a kettle to boil or a microwave to finish, to do some simple strength exercises using your body as a weight (squats, press-ups, triceps dips etc.)",1599168547.0

Anyway, here’s my question: Because I’m staying at home all day these past few months, I’ve been able to put way more time into preparing meals and so I’ve started buying all fresh produce and way fewer processed foods, and cooking all my meals instead of going out to eat a lot. Though I don’t diet I do log all the food I eat, to refer back to if I have a problem or notice a change in how I feel, and I have noticed that I consume what seems to me to be a significantly fewer number of calories than I did before, to the point that I’m not hitting recommended daily calories for someone my weight.

Family member is a bit concerned about my disordered eating recovery methods,28,ijf7wy,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ijf7wy/family_member_is_a_bit_concerned_about_my/,5,"So, I made a post a bit ago about breaking away from the diet culture in order to recover. I was just starting out, so I was a bit nervous and was seeking advice from everyone on here. A lot of people replied and gave me tips/advice (which I'm still so very grateful for) and I've dived head-first into eating without restriction, which has been going great. 

I was, at first, still holding onto a few restriction rules, but they've gradually slipped out of my mind the more I've done this. It's still a bit frightening, since having no rules to follow has led me to binging a lot and eating every other hour. Having no structure does tend to drive me insane at times, but I hear that this is relatively common when it comes to recovery, so that is a bit of a relief. I've also packed on a bit of weight, which really excites me since I know it's a sign that I'm getting closer to my goal. 

So, the problem is that my grandmother has noticed the binging and keeps trying to deter me from doing it. She keeps bringing up the topic of how binging doesn't sound like a good idea, how she's worried that I'll develop diabetes from the food that I keep binging on (since it runs in the family) and how she's worried that I'll turn ""obese"" from the amount of food that I eat everyday. I know she's only concerned and I appreciate that, but I don't think she realizes how triggering her words are. It's not like I do want to binge like this, but I've made it clear that I've done my research and know which direction I should be heading in (and binging seems to be a normal part of this). I guess I'm just tired of brushing her words off and explaining why I need to recover this way. I'm sick of feeling ashamed for eating the way that I am right now because I hold my family's thoughts/opinions to a high regard. 
I guess I just needed to vent since this has been weighing heavily on my mind for a long while now.

What do you guys think?

***Edit***

Thanks for all of the advice, guys. I had a talk with her afterward and she further explained why she was worried. We worked it out, however, and I explained how my approach is supposed to work. She seems to understand now and hasn't brought it up since, so it's resolved now.

I told her that I just wasn’t in the mood to get into a big discussion about this because she knows I follow a different philosophy. She then started to dig into me and told me I am addicted to sugar and carbohydrates, and I asked her what she meant by that because I was very confused. According to this new doctor, and to her now, your body does *not* need sugar or carbohydrates. I was absolutely floored by this and reiterated that your body NEEDS both of those nutrients to survive. She then said that I won’t be able to get pregnant (I just got married) because I refuse to give up sugar and carbs.

Now I’m noticing a direct connection between what I eat and how I feel. I have a lot of trauma related to being kept hungry as a kid and the idea of having to give up the snacks and food I love and was denied for a long time really brings me down. But, the pain is debilitating and I cannot live the life I’ve been working towards if I continue to feel this way, much less get worse (and my disease is progressive). 

The triggers seem to be, of course, everything delicious - sugar, dairy, processed oils, probably gluten as well.

At the start of the year I had to leave my job and had surgery not long after. As soon as I was recovered from it enough to start going out again, the lockdown started. Then I lost two family members a month apart. I have been sedentary, depressed, isolated, sleepless, and my diet has been all over the place.

So naturally my weight has been fluctuating all over the place. I had been losing weight for several months because of my active job, then I lost more weight immediately after surgery, and then regained all of it. I don't blame myself for it. I have already been trying to improve my diet in order to improve my cholesterol. I need to exercise more but trying to go gentle on myself.

The thing is that my clothes are now fitting a bit tight and I have to make a decision.

The obvious thing to do seems to be to just accept it and buy a size up.

But I'm kind of having a hard time accepting the idea and I'm not sure if it's for a good reason or if it's my body image issues creeping out again.

One part of me is saying: I feel like my weight is probably just going to drop again soon. I just got back to taking medication that tends to cause weight loss as a side effect, I'm eating less, I've stopped gaining weight now. I have enough clothes to wear in the meantime, even if they're not great, it's not like I'm even going outside much. I don't want to waste loads of money buying clothes that are just going to be too big in a couple of months.

But another part of me is saying: You're just rationalising. You're clinging onto the idea of losing weight for emotional reasons, not practical reasons. You don't know how long it's going to take you to lose that weight, and you can't be sure that you will, especially since you're currently sedentary and not showing any signs of improving on that front. You need decent clothes that fit you right now.

So happy to have found this sub. In many ways I still feel gripped by my eating disorder, but reading all of your accounts and dismantling of diet culture is really really helpful.

I just wanted to flag something that I only recently became aware of after watching a Natasha Oceane video, which is constant body checks. In one of her videos, she listed body checking as a bad habit she had to break to improve her health.

(If you don't know, a body check is basically starting/evaluating your body or face in the mirror.)

I used to body checks a lot when I was in the depths of my ED, but the number has reduced since then. That said... after watching that video, I realized my daily body check number is still FAR from zero. I do it pretty much every time I pass a mirror. It is pretty constant. I also believe the amount of times I do it has gone up since I stopped weighing myself.

As Natasha pointed out (not to deify her but she does have some great anti-diet points), body checking is basically rewiring the part of your brain that connects weight/appearance with importance/value over and over and over again throughout the day. It's you subconsciously telling yourself that your weight and appearance is important to your value, which is fully inaccurate.

Since then I've been catching myself doing this and trying to snap out of it and move on by! I figured it might help for some people to be more aware of, since it's an insidious bad habit that I didn't even realize I still had. Good luck out there y'all!",1597591056.0

Everyone who has the argument of “look at how the Japanese, Swedish, Chinese, French, etc eat. They have the healthiest BMIs and the longest life spans in the entire world. This is how we were meant to eat” etc etc. Basically health fear mongering and whatnot. Saying that Whole Foods plant based, or pescatarian, or whatever is the healthiest way to eat. These countries eat the way they do because that is the food resources they have. 
Have you ever thought maybe they are the “healthiest” (whatever that means) not because of what /how much they eat, but because they’ve NEVER DIETED? 
I’m sure it’s been said before and I’m late but it’s just a revelation I had lol.

I went hiking with friends yesterday and it was the first time in quite a while that I've had full length photos taken of myself. I started the day off thinking I looked cute and feeling good about myself. After I got home, my friends texted out the photos they had taken during the hike, and I was instantly triggered. What I thought was a cute outfit looked more like something an ""old lady"" would wear. It accentuated my belly, and I was horrified by the sight of my legs. Ever since, I've been thinking about hiring a personal trainer, trying to figure out how to decrease my food intake without technically ""dieting"", and telling myself the reason why none of my dates have gone any further is because the photos on my dating profile don't match what I currently look like (I had used photos that were a couple years old, just bc I don't take many pictures of myself, but still thought they were an accurate representation).

I don't know how to reconcile how I *feel* I look with what I actually look like. I don't understand how I can feel happy with how I look in the mirror but horrified by pictures taken on the same day.

New pants don’t fit...,52,i5g0rj,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/i5g0rj/new_pants_dont_fit/,10,"And it sent me through a small emotional loop. They are the EXACT same number size as some pair of pants that I bought a few months back (from the same site) and none of them fit. 

My first knee jerk reaction was to become upset and start beating myself up about “getting fat” and proclaimed to my husband *”I’m going to have to lose weight!”* and he responded with *”or you could just buy the next size up?”*

I was shell shocked for a moment. Then I took these pants and compared them to the other pair of pants I had previously bought and realized that, though they are the same size numerically, they are in fact an entire inch smaller in the waist!

Then I sat and thought about why my **first** reaction was to lose weight and punish myself. Why was my husbands first reaction to simply buy bigger pants. Why didn’t I bother to even compare the sizes?

To these questions I have to say: fuck society. It’s definitely society and it’s beauty standards, weight loss brain washing, and the intrinsic notion that buying a size up equates to being too heavy, that has helped to form the knee jerk reaction I had.

Im not gonna lose weight. I don’t *need* to lose weight. I am, however, going to buy these pants a size up. I am, also, going to start working on not fearing having to ever buy a size up. My worth isn’t tied to sizes, imaginary numbers, or the thickness of my waist.",1596814646.0
"If you don’t associate with fat people or people bigger than you, that’s weird",11,i5gko4,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/i5gko4/if_you_dont_associate_with_fat_people_or_people/,6,"**TLDR: Normalize expanding the range of people you associate with, perspectives you consider.**

*CW: Specific example of fat marginalization, some general talk of straight size/plus size.*

I know I’m mostly preaching to the choir here and I don’t mean to speak over those most hurt by this, but I’d like to make it popularly considered to be abnormal to not associate with or expose yourself to a significant part of the population. But I think for many people, not connecting with fat people is their norm. It *is* weird if you don’t follow any people noticeably bigger than you on social media, engage normally with acquaintances/coworkers/neighbors that are fat, etc.

I’m sure a few people will look at this and say “but I only have one close friend” or “everyone in my family is genetically very slim” and I’m not saying the handful of closest people to you in the world will necessarily be representative of the population, but I think most of us can do better in this regard with folks of various marginalized identities (I’m evaluating it within myself!). I went to a university where most women were smaller than me. I was very thin (underweight for myself) when I was sickest and that was considered “average,” and then when just slender-ish, smaller women would ask for unsolicited advice about body positivity, men would tell me they “have a thing for big girls.” Which whatever, “big” isn’t something you have to defend yourself from, but if you are straight size and have a friend who is a couple sizes larger than you or date someone slightly outside your norm, that doesn’t mean you are body accepting - don’t let yourself off the hook for perpetuating systems of oppression. While no student could singlehandedly fix that problem, I think an important first step would be at least recognizing “it’s very weird and gross that this university admits few fat people or there is such a weight loss culture that there is little diversity in size.” 

I think a lot of the relates to the co-opting of “body positivity.” Obviously the term has been taken by the industry to re-promote conventionally accepted bodies, but I find in like influencer/beauty culture, a lot of people think being body positive is barely tolerating, deeming “brave to exist,” conventionally attractive, mostly white women who are in the middle of straight sizes. Of course anyone can struggle with self-esteem and deserves to feel okay with themselves, but that just perpetuates oppression as it’s complete marginalization of fat people and emphasizes to others that while they won’t be marginalized, they still really should lose some lbs. I hope more people will ask themselves, and then change their behavior as needed, “when is the last time I meaningfully engaged with/became friends with/consumed content by people bigger than me (whatever size that may be)? People who aren’t straight size or low end of plus size? People who are fat *and* black or LGBTQ+ or poor?”",1596816469.0

The Anti Diet Journey,23,i401lh,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/i401lh/the_anti_diet_journey/,10,"Hello all, I just joined and looking forward to this group. My name is Krysta and I’ve been free of binge dieting since March. 

I’ve known for a long time that crash/binge dieting didn’t work but I always had the mindset “If I could only lose X pounds, then I’ll stop dieting”. I think you all know the cycle that that statement starts. 

I did the on and off dieting for years on top of strict gym works outs and severely limiting carbs of any kind. 

After years of damage and restriction, I was done. All it took was for me to read the Fuck It Diet once and I knew this is what I had to do. For my body, for my health and for my overall sanity. 

So I decided to stop restricting. And let me tell you, it was a scary couple of weeks. For years I’ve been telling myself that I can’t eat pasta. Guess what I ate for nearly the whole first week? Pasta. And now several months later, my body doesn’t want it or crave it anymore. 

I have gained weight but I’m learning to love my body the way it’s supposed to be. Not to mention my worth doesn’t revolve the number on the scale. (Which I don’t even know what it is and I don’t care to know). 

Here is what I have had a problem with on my journey...

- Worrying about people that knew me when I was dieting/restricting and their thoughts on how I look now 
- How easy it is to slip back into a diet mindset (I fell off the wagon once but was fully committed the next day after noticing how far I’ve come)
-  I don’t enjoy buying larger clothing...it does give me a bit of anxiety knowing my body is taking up more space
- Accepting my body fully and respecting it to the fullest degree 
-  Not having a community of people who understand anti dieting 

With all that being said, I’m in a pretty good place. I did have a set back but only for a day and it was crazy how quickly my body went into starvation mode, because I thought I could
manage intermittent fasting (which is a big no-no). 

Thankful to be in this space and helping others along this journey. Looking forward to connecting!",1596607918.0

It was a talk show where a girl was talking about how she lost a bunch of weight, and basically going through what she ate before and after. So triggering! Besides her cutting all carbs, she also mentioned that she starved herself (in these words exactly) until she lost weight. Wtf?? How is this even allowed on television? I honestly feel sad for that girl and the fact that they're enabling what could become something much more serious down the line, if she continues the ""diet"".

This made me realise just how deep diet culture goes in our society. My mum, who was watching it, saw nothing wrong with it, and everyone on the talk show was really proud of the girl, as if starving yourself was good or healthy? Not to mention the sad little meals she showed on her ""what I currently eat"".

I had to remove myself from the living room, it was honestly so unnerving to see that, and how normal everyone thought it was.

He's beyond needing encouragement from me and IMO he needs professional help but he's just stuck in a cycle of ""I'm fat and therefore I'm not good enough and I need to lose weight.""

He's been on and off keto for YEARS. He'll lose some weight, have to get off it for some reason (cost, convenience, etc) and will put the weight back on. He'll talk about his lack of willpower while eating potato chips. And now if he just stayed on keto he would be losing weight. 

This past week was especially bad. He gained some weight and decided to start carb counting again. I cook our dinners every night. He asked if I could cook low carb things. I told him no, I'm going to cook what I want and he can have it or not. 

Yesterday, I made a pie to have for dessert this week. All day he was obsessing over the pie, asking if it was ready. When it came time for the pie, he ate half of it. Because he's starting low carb tomorrow and he won't get to eat sweets for a long time. Those are his words, not mine. 

It's just so sad to me that this is considered normal to so many people. I'm upset that half the pie is now gone because I was looking forward to having it this week. I hate that he's so insecure and thinks he needs to look like Brad Pitt to be sexy.",1596454651.0

Turning the corner (success!),20,i1aze1,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/i1aze1/turning_the_corner_success/,1,"Last week I wrote a post about the difficulty I was having with the emotional aspect of being anti-diet. That was manifesting on a couple of levels: 1. No longer being able to use dieting and the fantasy of the “perfect” body as an escape, coping mechanism, and reason to delay my life, and 2. Losing interest in binge eating “forbidden” foods as a way of coping, since the foods are now allowed and eaten when desired. 

Not having these outlets made my emotions pretty hard to deal with for a few weeks but I’m happy to report that things are stabilizing. This means soooo much as someone who struggled with PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) to the point of requiring hospitalization on several occasions. Bingeing was also a huge part of the disorder— straight up it’s listed as a symptom and I thought it was just a necessary part of my experience, but I’m currently in the most challenging part of my cycle and have not had a single binge, nor have I had the desire for one. I noticed that I eat more during my luteal phase, but I’m just letting it happen naturally and it’s feeling a lot better than fighting back and bingeing. 

Recently, I felt myself turning the corner. That’s not to say I won’t have challenges in the future, but something finally clicked on a mind-body level, and everything is easier. Suddenly I don’t dread hunger, I welcome it. What’s more, I actually get excited about cravings because I know they’re my body’s way of telling me what I need. I used to think I was broken because I would only crave simple carbs, but now that I’m allowed to eat carbs unrestricted (along with the other macronutrients) I am finding myself craving a huge range of foods. It’s way easier to obey my hunger and fullness cues.

It’s also been a lot easier to gauge when I want to move my body and when I need to rest, since both are good, kind, and beneficial. 

Of course, the hardest thing remains living in a fatphobic society that’s obsessed with dieting, and some shallow version of “health” but another thing I’ve noticed is that the messages to diet from ads, friends and family, etc, aren’t as emotionally charged for me. Because what I’m doing works— I’m more energetic, my neurological symptoms have greatly reduced, I’m calmer and no longer fixated on food, and I have freedom. I don’t ever want to give that up.

Basically, I just wanted to say that I’d been in quasi-recovery from disordered eating and diet cycling for about 6 months, (I managed to turn IE into a diet), and then I at last took the plunge into completely unconditional permission to eat about 6 weeks ago, after reading The Fuck It Diet, and have been improving ever since. I thought I was the one person this wouldn’t work for, but alas, it’s happening. So I wanted to offer some solace to anyone who’s struggling right now— it will get better, and it can happen for you at any size and at any age. Sometimes it requires a leap of faith, but you’re in good hands. Your body’s got your back.",1596214351.0
A Little Lost,14,i0wptx,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/i0wptx/a_little_lost/,11,"Alright, so I'm fairly new to intuitive eating and I still find myself struggling with some things. I realize that my restrictive behavior had resulted in the loss of my menstrual cycle (I don't know if it's appropriate to mention that here) and I decided that I was going to leave all of that behind me. It's been several weeks since then, but I find myself still grappling with some of that restrictive behavior. It's getting easier to ignore the longer I do practice intuitive eating, but I realize that I still have some things I would like to learn about. 

Firstly, I found myself struggling with certain food groups. Lately, my focus has been centered around Belvita biscuits/granola bars and I find myself in a mental tug-of-war in whether I should give into cravings such as those. I know it sounds strange and all, but has anyone else found themselves craving a certain food when they first began eating intuitively?

Another problem I have is distinguishing true hunger signals. I'm still trying to get the hang of listening to my body instead of obsessively stalking the clock, but I've recognized that I have moments where my thoughts start to orbit around food and I've decided to eat whenever that happens. I was just wondering if that might be considered a hunger signal besides a growling stomach?

Lastly (so far), I hate to admit it but I still find myself mentally counting and worrying about calories. It's a habit that I'm working to stop, but it's like the numbers are ingrained into my brain. I'm thinking that the more I stray away from safe foods, it'll eventually stop or I'll learn to ignore it, but I still feel a bit anxious about it. I think this is my biggest struggle so far. I still find myself wondering if I'm eating too much and worried that I'm going to gain weight eating the amount of food that I am now (I'm still learning to accept that I have a weight that my body is happiest at and that it may not be the weight I'm at now/want. I know I mentioned the loss of my menstrual cycle earlier and I want to mention now that I'm nowhere close to being underweight and that I'm not working towards the weight regain that is usually associated with amenorrhea recovery). I guess I'm still learning the amount of calories that I actually need (and not what a calculator says) and that I'm fighting the anxiety that comes with it. 

I was wondering if any of you had any tips that could help with these problems/experiences that you all had when you started this journey as well?

Edit: Thank you all for the support, tips, and advice! Knowing that this is completely normal for people who have gone through similar circumstances is very comforting and it makes me realize that I'm definitely on the right path. 
Seriously, this is all so helpful and I can't describe how grateful I am that you guys stopped what you were doing to give me advice. I've been struggling with this for a while and was very hesitant to come here seeking advice, but I'm so glad I did because you guys aided me in easing those doubts and I am so very grateful for that. 
So, thanks again for all the kind words and advice once again. I hope you all are doing great and that your journey here is wonderful and smooth",1596151768.0
Rant: I wish fitness wasn't so interwoven with weight loss/dieting.,134,i081k7,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/i081k7/rant_i_wish_fitness_wasnt_so_interwoven_with/,23,"I know there are people who don't focus their fitness/exercise on weight loss or aesthetics, but it seems like every blog/sub/whatever is overrun with the diet stuff. I just left the r/fitness30plus group because of so many posts center around weight loss or achieving abs. I thought since its geared towards a slightly older crowd, that it would be more about the actual fitness but its the same old crap.

Recently saw a post from a woman with a conventionally attractive body who didn't want her already slim stomach to have the ""B"" shape (you know, the normal side-view where you see some roundness at the ribs, then it goes in a bit at the belly button, then full again at the lower stomach.) And then all the comments/advice were about cutting calories. One person even commented they couldn't get their stomach totally flat until they went down to 1200 calories. Not a single person pointed out that its a perfectly normal stomach shape or encouraged her to focus on other successes or anything. It just made me so depressed. I already spent my teens and twenties obsessing over minuscule aesthetic complaints with my body that nobody else ever noticed and now at 30 years old, I just don't want to be exposed to it anymore.

I find it sad that people in their 40s, 50s and beyond are still obsessing about not having the perfect body. And I know its just conditioning and it takes conscious effort to get out of the diet mindset, but it just makes me feel angry and annoyed at people for putting it out into the world. I guess you could describe it as mild triggering because it kinda derails my mood and i can get stuck feeling frustrated. (I try to use the word ""triggered"" judiciously because I don't want to compare my annoyance to someone actually experiencing a PTSD trigger or something.)

I'd just love a fitness community that forbids discussion of diet/weight loss/random aesthetic complaints, etc and focuses more on learning about exercise, sharing your journey towards a nonweight related goal, get advice etc.

I strive to not buy things in too much packaging for the environment rather than my health, and I'm not really deep into the IE journey since I'm still working on my fear foods/finding my hunger cues/securing good ED treatment with people who are willing to work with a plant-based diet for ethical reasons. 

are there any anti-diet vegans out there? i know the regular vegan sub has a bit of the factions between ""junk food"" vegans and WFPB vegans, but I just want to know if there are vegans on this sub or a similar one who don't ascribe moral value to food (past like, ethics regarding animal products/sustainability) and some stuff about how the anti-diet stance works for them! i don't like the idea of calling people ""junk food"" vegans because they have a bit of vegan cheese or a chick'n nugget and i HATE the WFPB sector that's super anti-oil as it's really triggering to have such strict food rules and honestly a bit of olive oil isn't going to give ANYONE heart disease. 

i want to just be a vegan who eats what i feel like (someday i'll make it) and meet other vegans who feel the same way and don't feel the need to restrict EVERYTHING processed or identify with eating lots of processed stuff. would anyone be interested in starting a vegan/environmentalist anti-diet community or does anyone relate to this at all?


Edit: cool to see so many vegans here and glad they exist in this community :)

It seems like there's a good community that would end up on an anti-diet vegan sub but I also feel like I'm new to the anti-diet community and not fully committed to it so it isn't my place yet. I'm a bit conflicted on it as there's a spectrum of plant-based eating too, and I'm not really comfortable with anything less than 100% which would mean the sub would be a bit small. Seeing dairy and eggs is kind of stressful for me now that I know what goes into their production, and I look at my vegan subs as a bit of a refuge from animal products I have to face IRL, so I would not be fit to run that sub if it ended up being a vegan/vegetarian/plant-based kind of sub (which it might be since it seems like a lot of people who become plant based after an ED struggle w the purity part and have to keep it 99% for their mental health) but it also seems hard to strictly gatekeep it as a vegan sub.",1595987604.0

After having lost a large number of weight I became really exhausted with only being able to eat **xxxx** amount of calories a day in an attempt to reach this wild goal weight that *technically* is within the “healthy” weight range, shamed in to thinking that if I ate ANY MORE than what my calorie counting app had decided was enough for me then I ruined a weeks worth of hard work and wasn’t truly dedicated to my health, and I became genuinely exhausted with this rodeo. I was so absorbed with what I was eating, how much of it I was eating, and I couldn’t even enjoy life or time with my friends/family.

However, every now and then, someone who does not consider themselves as involved in disordered eating (I can't say they don't have one per se) comes in and asks for fitness advice because ""oh you guys know about eating and exercise"". It frustrates me to no end.

We're literally ill and trying to cope when someone decides to romanticize our illnesses to our faces. It's also exclusionary to people with non-restrictive EDs because these people just assume that the only valid EDs are essentially skinny-itis. It's like going to rehab and asking for dealers people can recommend to you. 

It's so upsetting because I doubt these people even think they're doing anything wrong. They probably see people who suffer from BN or AN as a model of self-control when that is nowhere near the truth.

I’m a first time poster, who’s been lurking for quite a while. I’ve recently started my IE/HAES journey after years of disordered eating, guilt, and incredible anxiety around food and weight. I started seeing an intuitive eating (and haes) nutritionist who is absolutely amazing.
I have my annual wellness visit/Pap smear at the gynecologist next week and I’m dreading the seemingly obligatory weigh-In. I stopped weighing myself a few months ago after obsessively weighing myself multiple times a day. I’m so worried I’ll be somehow guilted into being weighed, and even if I step on backwards, I know it’ll be somewhere on the paperwork and I don’t even want the possibility to see it. I’ve practiced my sayings, like “I prefer not to be weighed until or unless it’s medically necessary like for dosing of a medication” (I have Nexplanon already so I’m fairly certain there’s no new medications I’ll be needing). And I’m practicing “I’ve recently started treatment for disordered eating and I’m practicing a weight neutral approach to my health and it would be detrimental to my treatment to be weighed at this time.” And I’m just terrified because I have no idea how the nurse will respond. It’s entirely possible that they’ll just say okay, or be annoyed but just go with it, and that’s fine, I can take them being pissy at me, but I’m so worried that they’ll say something that I’m not expecting or guilt me into it somehow. Being someone with a larger body, I am convinced they’ll think I’m just some “sad fatty” who can’t “take the truth” or some other bullshit. I guess I’m just looking for a little advice and some reassurance.

But, being so new to this, every day is a struggle. I second guess things, I feel isolated in what I’m doing, I still have fears of surrendering to where my body wants to be. So that’s one thing.

The other thing is I think dieting was keeping me “safe” for a long time— like not really, since it was unhealthy, but “safe” in the way alcohol or drugs might have helped someone survive something terrible. To be clear I’m not saying that “food” is or ever was the problem, I mean dieting— the project and the act of obsessing over fixing myself.

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced big emotions of grief or rage that are maybe also related to traumas in life? Traumas that were stamped down with the “goal” of getting the “perfect body?”

Just when I thought it was safe to express my views on diet culture....,11,hw7780,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/hw7780/just_when_i_thought_it_was_safe_to_express_my/,16,"I have been making social media posts about the meals I have made in quarantine because I have been really proud of them.  

In response to a small diet-culture misunderstanding: I actually had an amazing interaction with my father about my journey, and he was really supportive!  Huzzah!  
 
In response to that support, I decided to make a post about my journey rejecting diet-culture, and my path to intuitive eating.

Now, I do want to say that overwhelmingly: the comments were in support, and expressing a lot of positivity about what I shared.

There was one comment though that bothered me, because it felt as though the person( who I really respect, and like BTW) wasn’t paying attention to what I wrote.  I mainly wrote a post proclaiming that I was currently on a journey to heal my relationship to food & my body.  A journey that includes listening to my body, and taking pauses to feel my fullness.

This person replied that they felt similarly to how we would treat overweight pets: sometimes people just eat too much.  This person went on to describe their own emotional eating past( which I can absolutely identify with), but instead of seeing the direct connection in restricting: this individual suggested that we should not be eating as much as we do, especially because lots of our foods are processed. 

This individual finished by mentioning that fasting once a week is excellent for body/mind: which was the only part that felt really left field for me, because in the same sentence this person also mentioned having to actively tell themselves to stop eating mid-meal( which lead me to think...well if you are fasting every week: your body is used to an imposed famine every week..makes sense).

Anyway: I felt pretty good about my response, but this comment was also laced with a lot of fat-shaming.

This individual kept insisting that everyone wouldn’t be fat if they just didn’t eat as much( claiming we all need far less food than we eat: which may be technically “true” for some people, but all humans have different nutrition, and caloric needs based on many factors.)

So...Suddenly my vulnerable post about my journey with my relationship to food and my body became about defending different sized bodies.

Because this IS the diet-culture mentality: 

The belief that if we all just ate LESS forever we would be thin. 🤦‍♀️

We have several individuals in this group recovering from ED where they basically starved themselves that PROVE this just isn’t true.  

So: I will take the win of the moment that I feel like I reached a lot of people who felt similarly to me.

I was also just sad to discover that diet-culture is still so ingrained in people who I respect. It hits harder.

**Update** This person did respond to me saying that they didn’t specifically mean everyone would be “thin”, but that they meant “the right weight for their body size”.....😔So..I don’t feel like going down the rabbit hole further with this.  She is going to do some research on intuitive eating on her own, and I am going to take this as a “as good as one can hope” situation.",1595469913.0

My particular situation: my sister is a long time dieter and has some history of restricting and binging.

I'm new to this whole anti-diet thing. I don't really have a pattern of restricted eating. I could eat what I wanted until my mid-to-late twenties and then I started putting on pounds. I have a history of emotional eating and bingeing, however. Not huge binges, but definitely binges. I felt trapped by this pattern as I would get sad, want to eat everything, and then just feel sadder. 

IF did work for me in terms of weight loss (this is not to argue the merits of it, I know it is not accepted on here, this is just for context). I stopped IF when I became pregnant because I was too hungry and did not want to restrict, and now I've been breastfeeding and at the beginning I was ravenously hungry as well. During pregnancy and early BFing, I felt very in-tune to my body and my hunger. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted, and it was not emotional. Or even if it was, it was more happy emotional, if that makes sense. Worth mentioning the weight was falling off at this point, so it was easy to feel happy eating whatever I wanted. I would say this was one of the few times in recent years I was actually able to eat intuitively.

Fast-forward. My crazy metabolism has stabilized, even though I'm still BFing, and I'm drawn back to those binge patterns again. I'm wondering ... do you just let yourselves binge? Even if it makes you feel physically not so good? So many of you have mentioned that IE helped stop the binge cycle and I'm just wondering how. 

I know I could slow down, start with a smaller portion, wait 20 minutes before seconds, etc., but all those things feel to me like diet culture.

But now I get guilt if I even eat something healthy like an apple or orange. It happens like this: I've been reading Evelyn Tribolis book.

Like even something simple as an apple. If I feel that I didn't enjoy the food,I feel guilty. Sometimes I feel obligated to leave food on the plate because I'm supposed to be satisfied with half the amount coz that's what IE does right? I'm afraid I've misunderstood certain concepts. Sometimes I have issues when I'm the last to eat at home and my mother has left food for me. So I tend to try ""clean my plate"". Sometimes I feel guilty for not cleaning my plate too.

Vent about chips and a c u next Tuesday stranger in a grocery isle.,76,hll182,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/hll182/vent_about_chips_and_a_c_u_next_tuesday_stranger/,22,"Hi I just joined this group but I’m a long-time anti-diet/HAES/fat-positive/body liberation advocate and I just gotta vent right quick.

First off, I am a midfat person. I recognize that my body type, while not “ideal” by any patriarchal beauty standards in the slightest, still holds a vast amount of privilege over larger body types. 

That being said, god I just need to vent real quick. 

I have a lifelong history of bulimia and only in the last couple years have I really reached a place where I can confidently say I’m in recovery. I’ve gained a fair amount of weight in these two years because that’s just what bodies tend to do when they are no longer being subjected to intense restricting and binging cycles or yo-yo dieting or weight cycling. 

I eat intuitively, and I’m vegan. I’d say, all in all, I eat a pretty balanced diet with lots and lots of veggies. 

I definitely don’t look anything like the stereotypical “vegan” and people are often shocked to find that I am vegan. (I *wonder* whyyyy?? Definitely *not* cuz i’m fat! /s) 


Anyway I was at a health food grocery store yesterday and my cart consisted of the following: fresh beets, a tiny vegan chocolate cake, a veggie wrap, spicy guacamole, and almond milk.  Mind you, I was in exercise clothes as I had actually walked to the grocery store from my house which is 2.5 miles away (so a 5 mile walk there and back). I do this walk often as I like to kill two birds with one stone and go grocery shopping while I take my dog out. 

Anyway, I was in the chips isle and looking for the cheapest bag of tortilla chips for my guacamole. 

Suddenly, this Karen-looking witch comes up to me holding a bag of chips and tells me that I should try this particular brand because it’s made with beans and it isn’t processed like all the other chips I’m looking at. 

I’m standing there just *willing* her away hoping she’ll let me shop in peace. Then she has the audacity to tell me that corn will only increase my belly fat and that I should stay away from it. 

I wanted so badly to tell her to “fuck off” or something but I was just so dumbfounded as to why this bitch thought it was totally okay to talk to me like that. 

Instead, after she finished her totally unwarranted monologue, I grabbed three large bags of corn chips and put them all in my basket and walked away as I yelled “I like being fat, thanks!” 

But it all felt hollow and unsatisfying because it means nothing to her. I just wish that there was anything at all I could say to people like that, who think that their insecurities about fat bodies are totally universal and that because they are thin they have any right at all to tell a fat person how to live or that they have any authority on the health of a complete stranger. 

It’s so hard to just let these things go. I’ve found myself going over it again and again in my head. But nothing will make it better. 

Fatphobia is so fucking insidious and I’m just so tired.

I’m so tired of feeling like I have to recount everything that was in my grocery cart, or explain my body size, or that I walked to the grocery store, or that I’m *actually* healthy, to justify my fat body. 

Our eating or living habits should be IRRELEVANT to our right to dignity and human decency and kindness and love and I’m just so fucking tired of people thinking that because we’re fat, we’re missing something or we’re ignorant or we can’t make decisions for ourselves. 

It’s so fucking dehumanizing.",1593948008.0

* I was eating my lunch and started getting full with food left on my plate. Instead of just mindlessly finishing my food, I put back my food in the fridge. Besides intentionally wanting to save to have some for another day, I haven’t done this in years and it felt great! 

* My family had a small get together for with a decent sized buffet. All my cousins who were on diets stuffed themselves until they were full and couldn’t breathe. My cousin (who practices IE naturally) and I ate until we were full and we were comfortable and enjoyed the delicious food. We took leftovers and knew that we could enjoy this food if we wanted to later. No need to binge!

* I brought brownies back to my house and didn’t have a heart attack! I used to devour them on site which is why I never had sweets and snacks in my house. Not anymore. I looked at the brownies with a smile and said to myself “There’s no need to binge because I will enjoy you whenever I want!”

Practicing nonrestriction around juice / non-water drinks,19,hlovbp,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/hlovbp/practicing_nonrestriction_around_juice_nonwater/,11,"I've been practicing nonrestriction / refeeding for about 6 months now. This is my second or third run at letting go of dieting. I've learned the lesson multiple times that dieting = misery and weight gain, but dieting keeps changing shape in pop/health culture and I've gotten hoodwinked multiple times by the wolf in sheep's (your-life-and-health-will-be-perfect-after-this) clothing.

This time around I have started to realize the sneaky restriction that I've still been carrying around drinks.

The ""drink only water"" rule was probably the first rule I took up (probably around age 14) because of something stupid like Self magazine in the 90s.

Over the past decades I've drank way too much water (""your pee must be clear!""), as well as plenty of coffee, but those were the only ""allowed"" beverages except for rare occasions.

The only thing dieting has given me long-term is a narrowed life, body dysmorphia, exhaustion, significant hair loss, and iron deficiency.

My nonrestriction around eating is going well. I've realized that I'm still afraid of drinks, though. I'm afraid of juice and soda. There are endless beers and cocktails that I refused to even try because they were categorized as ""bad"" by diet culture.

I'm scared of drinks not just for weight, but the health and teeth police have been so loud about those substances. (i.e., juice causes diabetes \[false, right?\] and makes your teeth fall out of your head.)

But apple juice is amazing. I loved it as a (healthy, energetic) kid and, low and behold, still love it.

**My hunch from all of my anti-diet reading is to drink the juice, soda, whatever caloric beverages I'm craving as much as I want...**

**Trust that my body wants those substances and/or my mind needs to be free of the restriction of them...**

**And to sit with my fears around health (and teeth)\* and recognize that diet culture's ""control and prevention"" is a harmful illusion.**

For those more experienced and steady than I am right now, am I on the right track with this?

Thanks.

I made a post on here last week or so talking about diet and yoga and I felt that maybe the conversation could be continued on a forum to discuss yoga since maybe some people feel the same and it involves more yoga philosophy than antidiet stuff so I didn't want to get super deep into it here.

Well. Clearly not because I talked about the pressure to eat a ""pure"" diet on your yogic path and a couple other things that are discussed in a book I'm reading. I clearly stated that I have a disordered eating history and that this aspect bothered me because I see it as a ""rule"" and wanted to discuss whether this somehow effects my journey. I really don't know what I expected, all I know is that I don't think I'm less enlightened because I had a poptart today.

Responses I got include ""try eating twice a day and resting your digestive system"" and when I said that's not appropriate to say to someone with an ED history the person replied ""do you not think resting your digestive system is healthy?"" And I told them again that they need to be mindful of their audience and that I never said it was unhealthy. They said ""some people eat one potato a day and are perfectly healthy.""

??????? I can't waste anymore time discussing these things so I blocked them. Like oh my God even the yoga community where we're supposed to be supportive and inclusive wants to blacklist me for eating a poptart.

I have been educating myself and developing an anti-diet mindset for a couple of years to the point where I see obsessing with diets and your weight as really unhealthy which I find upsetting. However, I'm slim with an hourglass figure, I enjoy exercise (weight lifting and an occasional run) and I generally like to eat pretty 'healthy' as it makes me feel good. I therefore feel like I can never preach about why diets are bad as everyone will roll their eyes and either think I'm talking shit or be like 'yeah easy for you to say'.

Childhood grooming and food,50,hf7roo,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/hf7roo/childhood_grooming_and_food/,8,"TW: child abuse in all flavors.

Note: I am in therpy and have made leaps and strides in my mental health. 


My father was a pedofile. That's the nicest way to say it and I don't wanna be nice. Throughout my whole childhood I was a replacement for my mother, like a reverse Jocasta. It was in no way a secret on his families side, as my father himself was a Jpcasta for his mother, as was his older brother before him. You could say it runs in the family....



How does this relate to food/diet culture? Well, with child grooming comes a certain expectation to look good in the eyes of the abuser, and to my father, I was too fat. When he was being groomed it was drilled in his head by his mother that looks matter for the family. Being too fat would ruin the abusers fantasy of a perfect victim in this tale, but disguising it as a family appearance matter made it so much easier. He didnt want to molest a fat kid.



If I was too fat, my father would stop giving me the ""special attention"" only I got, while my brothers special attention was 60$ video games and freedom. At the time, I craved my abusers love and affection at any cost. I thought my brother got stupid video games but I got ""Love"" so that made me special. So my eating disorder started when I was around seven and didn't stop till very recently. 


This idea that weight is worth was cemented in me at a young age and taints diet culture for me to this day. As I got older I became uncomfortable with my fathers attention, and struggled with my ideals about weight. If I stayed skinny, I would get toys and attention and special shopping trips. At the same time being skinny also kept my father's attention on me, so inside a war was raging. 



Thia fucked me up five ways to Sunday. Diet or no diet? Love and attention or being ignored?


Should I gain weight to make him stop? Should I try to stay skinny so I would stay in the ""top spot"" and keep getting all the extra stuff? Was this MY fault for being.... well something I can't articulate to this day. Too pretty? Too skinny? Too ""yes sir""? Ot took me forever to realize it wasn't about my weight. He never actually cared. It was about control and sick mind games. 




In the end, that's all diet culture is. The grooming of young people to accept this idealism of perfection or beauty or health. I know it might be extreme to compare diet culture ideals to pedofilia grooming, but the adds, models, book descriptions of people bodies, etc, it shockingly similar to the things my father drilled into me. I saw it all over the TV, the news and magazines, so he must be right, huh? Well he wasn't. And neither is that late night diet infomercial.

The idea that if you lose weight you will immediately stop hating your body and have healthy shiny hair and strong nails and clear skin is largely a myth. 

For most people, they will probably lose hair and regain more weight than they had lost. And so even if you're losing weight purely for aesthetic purposes, not dieting is probably your best bet at ""looksmaxxxing"" if you care about these things LONG TERM. 

And even if you do look better by society's standards and don't lose any hair, studies show that caloric restriction makes people miserable. It's more effective to work on your body image from the inside out. People like to think that everything will fall into place when they lose weight, and then it doesn't and it never ends. Intentional weight loss often leads to hair loss, misery, low energy, eating disorders and future weight gain.

Of course that’s not true at all. Fat serves a purpose, it’s a natural part of their hibernation cycle. A lot of diet culture sort of glorifies things that are natural, like the way we’re “meant to be,” paleo diet, etc. I feel like this goes to show how fatphobia is just kind of a knee jerk reaction to fatness that we’ve been socially conditioned to, it’s not about nature or science at all.

"My disordered journey through the realm of ""wtf is that and why are it eating it?"", a southern tale",53,gvwnmf,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/gvwnmf/my_disordered_journey_through_the_realm_of_wtf_is/,10,"    On mobile so sorry. This is mostly thoughts about eating culture in the south and dieting here. I have no real idea where I'm not with this.... FYI I am looking at this through the eyes of a poor modern southern women who experienced higher traditional southern society. Yes it still exists and it just as strict as it was in the 50s. Yes there was a debutant ball. Yes I hated it. 


Eating in the Southern United states it a trip and a half, no matter how you feel about diet fads. I remember the first time I ate ramen at my grandmothers house, for example. She stuck her nose up and clearly asked ""what in blue hell is that?"" It wasnt a sandwich, pork and beans, or potted meat, so this lunch was new to her completely. 
 

I soon came to learn that in the south, women toe a narrow and strict line. You NEED to know how to fry chicken but DONT YOU DARE break your new Akins diet your husband got you for your birthday. In private parties you eat what is given, period. Throw it up latter. Otherwise its rude. 


As a teen, learning these strict rituals where odd because I wasn't part of that world, just visiting, so it was like I was outside looking in. And food was one of the biggest deal breakers. You where bombarded with country fried steak, meatloaf and beans. Cornbread and chicken dumplings. Chinese food was unheard of and any veggie that was not stewed/roasted was insane at a dinner party. 



Now to my point: toeing that line. As a teen every friends mother, sister, aunt, and the friend themselves where constantly on some diet plan. Atkins, paleo, cabbage diets and soup diets. Mothers where handing down diet info from the 80s and 90s to their daughters so outdated it cam from a 1980s good homes and garden book. Not to mention the small quite emotional abuse from family and friends.
 My own father would tell me ""I can see why you don't have friends, yimmie. You're always in a book and over weight."" And my personal favorite from my grandmother  ""let me make you're plate, yimmie, you always add to much."". 



With with friends you order salad. You sit at a pretty cafe with your sparkling water and you're white knee length pants, trying not to spill salad dressing. With family you delicately pick over your potato salad and Bojangles, trying to avoid the fried skin. At home, if your not with a family of you're own yet, you don't eat at all. Food is about looks. About status. And how much of that good goes to your waist and hips tells your neighbors all they need to know about you. 



And once you loose weight? It's the talk of the town! ""I heard Beth went down to a size five! After her second child I thought she'd never look normal again."" My own aunts rejoiced when I started my eating disorder, starving myself from a little over weight to super unhealthy in less then two years. Of course they had no idea about the disorder, just the fact I was looking like a young lady was good enough. 



Now I'm my mid 20s, a lot had changed. I am now back to my healthy size, cute butt and all. I cook alot for myself and it turns out I not only love fried chicken, but fish curry and street tacos. I eat alot of rice and vegetables, fish and dairy. I no longer attribute my size to the position of my families favor. I can still select the correct fork at a dinner party. I am still well read and can hold my own in conversation. I can back hand compliment you on your ugly hat and bad attitude like any southern peach. But at the same time, I no longer order a salad with the girls. And I no longer wear those white pants, thank god! Ok, sometimes.... but my food no longer reflects my worth. I no longer follow these rules, but my own. I eat healthy, as a lifestyle, with no diet. I no longer count calories and portion sizes. 


Food, diet culture and social standing all go in the same little box. Its part of family traditions and friend groups. It's part of humanity. But that doesnt mean it has to be a part of YOU.",1591200190.0
Loving yourself while navigating fatphobic fertility industry,13,gvuwen,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/gvuwen/loving_yourself_while_navigating_fatphobic/,11,"TW: Pregnancy Loss

Hello lovely people :) I'm a happy 31 year old who loved Anti Diet and is very pro haes and most of the time love existing in my large body. I've in recent years managed to untangle myself from the messy web of constant yo yo dieting and learned to listen to my body, trust it knows what I need, and practiced a lot of acceptance that I can be worthy, beautiful and live in a bigger bod.

This was all going well, I haven't owned a scale in about 2 years, however for the last year have been trying to have a baby and unfortunately suffer from recurrent miscarriages. I have been seeking specialist help to get to the bottom of it, and have an amazingly supportive GP, but unfortunately like many medical industries the fertility space is incredibly fatphobic, and although its unlikely my weight has anything to do with my issues I've been advised they want me to lower my BMI as part of my treatment plan. I should specify I am a small fat, so while they may be jerks they will treat me which I am aware is a privilege given how many women are denied fertility treatments based on the bullshit BMI system.

I got quite emotional about it today, and protested, explaining that I didn't think forcibly shrinking myself was going to help me physically or emotionally, and while they were very apologetic I am left feeling like if I refuse to try and shrink myself it somehow reflects on me not wanting a baby badly enough.

Does anyone have any advice for navigating these types of unfriendly spaces? I want to trust they are coming from an evidence based space, but also it feels like such a throw away comment doctors use when they don't know what else to say :(",1591194366.0

Struggling with physical changes,46,grkckr,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/grkckr/struggling_with_physical_changes/,15,"Hi all,

I have had some negative feelings about my weight and body so I wanted to reach out for support. 

I am not sure how much of my background is relevant, but I will try to sum it up. I am a middle aged mom now. I intentionally lost a significant amount of weight in my 20s due to dieting and exercising in an obsessive way. Nothing ""diagnostic"" for ED but like fully bought into diet culture and a lot of anxiety about weight and body. I slowly came back to a more natural way of eating as I entered my 30s and was able to enjoy food more and not see exercise compulsively. I was in a good place with my self image and my relaxed attitude with food until I got pregnant. My pregnancy was great, but afterwards I had severe PPD requiring hospitalization and serious psych meds. The meds saved my life, but also caused a lot of weight gain. It's been hard for me to sort out how much of the weight gain was hormonal, postpartum, stress, medication but anyhow they all added up to significant weight gain. I will not use any numbers, but I am far above my previous highest weight before I started dieting in my 20s.

I think because I am older now, I have been able to be more kind to myself and not worry so much about my weight and appearance. But of course, the thoughts are still there. A lot. I had made peace (for the most part) with never losing any of the weight and I am trying to instill a healthy relationship and attitude with weight with my child. My weight has been pretty stable for a few years, ever since I weaned off one of my medications. 

But then came quarantine. 

At first, I was kind of smug about the fact that I wasn't worried about gaining weight when I saw other people panicking about it. But then a few pounds came on and I was not so smug anymore. I am kind of freaking out. My clothes don't fit quite the same. I feel physically heavier going up and down stairs. I am getting heartburn. My eating habits haven't really changed, and I exercise daily (not in a punishing way, just a workout that makes me feel physically and mentally great), but of course I am mostly homebound, so I am sure I am getting deconditioned. Today I plan to wear a swimsuit and yeah . . . I'm not feeling great about that. But I also don't want to have my kid seeing me feel ashamed of my body. But like . . . it's not just appearance at this point. I don't like heartburn. I don't like feeling like I can't walk as fast and as hard as I want to. I want to keep up with my kid. I just can't bear the thought of gaining any more weight. 

I don't even know what I am looking for here. Maybe just some empathy. Thanks all!",1590588370.0

Diet culture gaslights people into believing that they don't restrict,119,go08id,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/go08id/diet_culture_gaslights_people_into_believing_that/,40,"I gave my mom the Intuitive Eating book to read over a year ago, and when I asked her how it is, she said that it understands her so well but she doesn't relate to any of the parts about ""extreme dieters,"" for she said that she herself is ""just an overeater."" I told her that she has been on extreme diets in the past and that it still affects her in ways she doesn't realize. I think she just believes that anyone who never became extremely thin was never ""an extreme dieter."" Unfortunately, she's doing Weight Watchers now. 

I once had a conversation with someone about how bingeing is usually caused by restricting (I don't try to convince people anymore; it's pointless), and he said that he ""doesn't restrict too much"" and is ""just on a healthy diet of 1400 calories a day."" Diet culture indoctrinates us into believing that 1400 (or even 1200 calories) is normal for grown ass adults, and so it makes us feel like we binge because we are internally flawed and not because 1400 calories or less IS ""an extreme diet"" for most adults.

And this isn't even taking mental restriction into account. My dad has a super orthorexic mindset and has a long list of foods that are ""bad,"" and yet he eats them every day (and is prone to bingeing). I once told my dad that he needs to stop restricting (again, I've learned my lesson that it's not going to work), and he said ""I'm not restricting. I'm just addicted to sugar."" What he doesn't understand is that believing that you're inherently flawed and addicted to sugar and need to lose weight someday is a form of restriction in and of itself. Telling yourself that you will one day stop eating ice cream could make you obsessed with ice cream. 

I think a lot of people tell themselves that they ""never restricted before"" because their diets didn't last very long or they never became ""underweight,"" but even restricting to be what's considered ""a healthy weight"" is still restricting. And then people say things like ""I have a messed up relationship with food but never restricted,"" but when you talk to them even more, they pretty much always have a history of restriction. 

Like I said, people underestimate how restrictive diets are and so they don't understand that keto, 1200 calories, Weight Watchers, etc. are all ""extreme diets."" Just because one isn't only drinking celery juice doesn't mean that one isn't ""on an extreme diet."" And take into account that intermittent fasting is mainstream and normalized, and there was a 5-year study on IF that showed that those who fast for weight loss are prone to BED and bulimia.

"Thoughts on ""Food Psych"" podcast",32,glz1vo,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/glz1vo/thoughts_on_food_psych_podcast/,19,"Hey all, I'm sure, like me, many of you listen to the Food Psych podcast.

I was wondering if anyone else has noticed that Harris seems to have a bias towards talking about gaining weight, and seems to strongly push back against narratives of people losing weight when eating intuitively?

A few weeks ago, (episode 238) she answered a listener question where someone asked for her thoughts on their lack of appetite during quarantine due to stress, and in that case she pushed back and suggested that they should force themselves to eat more. However, at many other times she says that people who have a higher appetite during times of stress should eat what they want in accordance with their body's hunger cues. 

I generally roll my eyes when people talk about HAES and Intuitive Eating working to ""promote obesity"" because, obviously a weight neutral approach doesn't promote any body type, but I can't help but see a glimmer of truth to their point when I hear dieticians share these messages. Harris is always promoting the (very real) benefits of allowing your body to gain weight when you're coming out of diet-mindset, but I have never heard her acknowledge the validity of weight or appetite fluctuating downwards. I also once heard her call a quote from the book Intuitive Eating, where they talked about not having to finish all the food on your plate, ""fat phobic"" which seemed a bit of a stretch.

To be clear, I like Harris and I always listen to her podcast, I just take what she says with a grain of salt because I think she has certain biases against acknowledging the possibility of weight loss occurring as a result of intuitive eating. Just wondering if anyone else has noticed this, and has any thoughts?",1589798052.0
Win? I think!,3,gm2la9,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/gm2la9/win_i_think/,4,"Hi all, really grateful for this space. I'm new to this concept and am currently reading the intuitive eating workbook while focusing on myself and what I'd do for fun without weight loss in mind. 
So that's all fine and good, and for just over a month I've stopped tracking, counting, fasting, etc. It's been a relief, but I'd be lying to say I haven't been stressed from time to time thinking, ""but am I gaining weight?"". So, fast forward to yesterday and I am trying to sell my wedding dress (had to postpone due to Covid, 2020 really sucks!) and the best way to figure out how much the dress weighed from home was to weigh myself with and without the dress and take the difference as the dress weight. 
I'm the same weight! I've listened to my body and I haven't gained, not that that would be bad thing, but it was amazing to see that for a month, I've just listened and forgiven myself, and it totally ok. 
I don't know if this is the best way to see a win, but it felt really good to validate that this path is for me and that I can be healthy and listen to my cues and that's just fine. 
I don't plan on weighing myself regularly, but it's been a crutch I'm scared to release completely. My goals have shifted from lose weight to increase movement and flexibility (lots of yoga and barre) and that's another huge win. Weekend of winning!",1589812587.0
“One of the healthy/clean eaters”,38,gki6gd,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/gki6gd/one_of_the_healthyclean_eaters/,16,"I am girding myself for a slew of brigaded downvotes.

I have seen this phrase pop up a few times  in my personal social media feed the past month: 

“I’m very healthy, I workout regularly, and eat clean, and here I am with ( insert medical ailment dujour..)”

I am in no way attempting to mitigate serious issues, or make an unfounded correlation.  We all know correlation does NOT equal Causation, and just because someone is thin doesn’t equal “healthy” anymore than being Fat immediately means “unhealthy”.

What’s my point? 

I know that health, and weight have far less to do with one another.  It’s why I am anti-diet.  

However: there is so much differing information on exercise.  About the only thing anyone can agree on is that doing SOME exercise( even a little) is good for everyone.

Because the people who usually post about being healthy/clean eaters & exercisers  are just as obsessive, and extreme about their exercise as they are their food.

We don’t have consistent research, or medical professionals discussing that running 5-7miles a DAY 5 times a week could be over-exercising.   

Or the fact that eating a very clean diet could actually lead to un-intended starvation or mal-nutrition if combined with constant extreme exercise( I am not including athletes who have designated training schedules, I am talking regular individuals who have near constant extreme routines & very little rest days.)

I remember when I was “eating clean”. That  usually meant salads, or tons of harder to digest greens and amounted to under the calorie amount I needed to sustain my 2-4 hour daily workouts. I thought I was the healthiest I had ever been, but I was sick all the time, and my hair was falling out! 

We certainly have some research, and amazing resources: but I suppose I am wondering if people know of more research being done?

**Edited to add: I have read a lot of HAES/intuitive eating/anti-diet books &amp;amp; articles.  I haven’t read as much about over-exercising, and as per usual: lots of “experts” disagree.",1589578984.0

I have been ALL IN with IE and HAES for a year or so now. I fully believe in it and have been trying to live the practice. But, I have also been trying to get pregnant since last August with no success. I have reached the point where my doctor may want to start fertility treatments in the near future, which can be expensive and taxing on the body. I want to try and be my healthiest self to maybe get pregnant before I get there (3 months or so), but reading about ""fertility diets"" gives me bad feelings. 

To be clear, I would be engaging in habits to boost my fertility, not to lose weight. Those would include more fruits and veggies, daily exercise, less caffeine, etc. I sincerely do not want to fuck up my IE progress. But, if changing my habits to be healthier could lead to getting pregnant without the treatments, I feel like I must try it.

Coming home has brought up a lot of old shit again. My parents talk about weight constantly. I recently disclosed to my mom that I was starting the IE thing because of my past. She seemed as supportive as a woman who I've never seen show human emotion of any kind can be, but she also mentioned stuff like the fact that my dad sometimes tells her he wishes I was like my old, skinny, beautiful self (I was 14 and underweight btw because I was eating < XXXcal a day, but that's totally fine -\_-).

I went in, had a seemingly normal eval and was told that while my history is too complex to say it's definitely ADHD or definitely not, I have underlying ADHD traits that are clearly interfering with my everyday life. He forwarded a reccomendedation to my therapist for us to work on focusing skills and another to my doc saying I'm a reasonable candidate for medication if I want it.

Then he put me on a diet.

He showed me a brain with constricted blood vessels and said it's often seen in people with ADHD around 20-30 years old. He then told me that it's caused by animal products and told me that after cutting them out, people with ADHD have improved focus.

My full evaluation with specific findings isn't available yet because this was 3 hours ago - he just gave me his impressions. But instead of a general overview, he sent me home with that brain scan (of a random person), 2 documentaries to watch (he wrote ""must-watch documentaries on it), and a list of foods I can and can't eat on this diet. He said I'm to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes only from now on.

I feel like I was suckered into some kind of vegan propaganda because this paperwork wasn't directed towards me or based on anything I told him - it's what he gives to everyone, and those documentaries are at the top, bolded with a border around them. He didn't even ask me about my diet, so for all he knows I already do everything he's suggesting. To be honest, I don't think it had anything to do with me or my weight at all. He is just really passionate about this diet.

At the same time, the diet SOUNDS healthy. It's just very restrictive, seeing as soy is out of the question for me and being low income means I can't just buy plant-based everything and eat whole foods only - my food stamp money would never last. For that reason alone, I can't go hardcore on this diet even if I wanted to. 

Just weird that a neuropsychologist would put me on a diet, you know? Has anyone else with ADHD had this kind of reccomendedation fed to them by a psych professional? (pun intended)

If you need to be thinner in order not to feel self-conscious about your body, you haven't improved your body image at all. Having good body image means that you realize that you are more than your body, and accepting your body means that you are okay with your body as it is now. Being okay with your body only after losing weight isn't an improvement at all. If body acceptance is conditional, then it's not body acceptance.

But she reassured me that I would be stronger, would have more energy, and would be able to concentrate better if I ate more. And she was right! I gained weight to the point that I was bordering on an ""overweight"" BMI. I also got stronger and healthier, and I started feeling more beautiful than ever.

Several months ago, around the time I adopted Wednesday, I started becoming very ill. I had stomach aches every day for months, and I still have persistent nausea. Despite my best efforts, I lost a lot of weight, bringing me down to my lowest adult body weight. And I'm so glad I gave myself that extra buffer zone! If I had started out thinner, I would be much sicker now.

As an aside, I'd like to thank Wednesday for having such a big, happy personality in spite of her serious chronic illnesses. She's been an inspiration and a support to me as I've come to terms with my own body's limitations. Wednesday and I are going to keep on taking care of ourselves and eating as much as we can!",1587558070.0

I've always been plagued with diet culture and this pressure I put on myself to look like I should. I think a lot of it links to my disability aswell because that's another thing that makes me stand out. As you all can probably guess I've never got there. I've never hit my 'ideal body' and I can pretty much state this this idbue to the fact that I don't think I would be happy even if I did. It's been about a year since I started discovering how to live an anti diet lifestyle and I would say about 6 months since I've embraced it.

I'm getting better with food! I do not have any restrictions, I eat whatever I want and however much I feel like at the time. There are times when I still have the odd pang of guilt or worry but I can shut that down quite quickly. My one thing they is still causing issues and really messing with my head is photos. They cause me genuine fear I'm scared of them being taken incase they show me in a bad light. Incase I look bigger than I feel I should. Incase the photos get uploaded to social media without my knowledge. I don't think I've taken a full length photo of myself in just under a year. This is because I'm terrified of what people will think or what they might say.

No one's is ever going to openly comment about my body on my social medias, I know that. I don't really out myself 'out there' and I don't friend people who would be like that. But it's that they might be saying it that scares me. I know I can't control what people say but thinking about it terrifies me! I can't look back at photos from a year ago because all I see are the size of my body and the flaws. 

All I want is to have the freedom with photos that I am experiencing with food. The amount of my energy that can now be put to better use because I'm not thinking about what I eat or what I'm going to have to do to make up for what I have eaten etc. Is so freeing. I don't want to be constantly thinking about how I look in my clothes and what if someone decides to take a photo and blah blah blah. I want to live my life and be a me to capture my memories! 

Has anyone got anything they do or know of that can help? I already follow a range of bodies on my social media accounts. I have books such as the fuck it diet and body positivity but I just need some help and reassurance I think!

I was getting really suspicious about her motivations because of talks around carbs being just ""sugar."" She was telling me about how the adjustments aren't too hard, she just needs to switch up some things... 

I just couldn't stand it so I blew up. I've been continually annoyed by keto since it's been recommended to me multiple times due to my epilepsy. Keto is really hard and unnecessary for the vast majority of people, medication helps my seizures anyway, and the discourse around it usually includes villifying carbs, which you need to survive. Please don't tell me I should take grapes out of my diet.

So I went off, talked about the disordered eating I experienced from trying keto and intermittent fasting... And I made things pretty awkward. I explained to her that I wasn't trying to shit on her decisions, but I've been having some very strong reactions to people fearing weight gain in these stressful times. 

I don't want anyone to worry about being more sedentary. There's this collective worry about weight gain that feels very triggering. But I do feel bad because I think I made my friend feel bad. I think I could have been more gentle.

Has anyone else realised they've been wrong about how much food their body needs for years and slowly learnt to eat more + be happy? I'm trying to and it's exciting but also scary.,10,g0zccd,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/g0zccd/has_anyone_else_realised_theyve_been_wrong_about/,2,"I'm very, very new here so if this isn't appropriate for this forum please let me know and I'll take it elsewhere - don't want to kill anyone's vibe or anything. 😊

A bit of background about me - I'm 25 and since I was a young teenager I've had a history of anxiety and disordered eating. I was never diagnosed with an 'official' disorder of any kind, but the thought patterns I've tackled since then aren't normal - there were times when a below-average amount of food felt like 'way too much', times where I had to feel hungry to feel in control, times where I tried to see how long I could last eating just scrambled eggs in the morning, times where i allowed myself only one 'carbohydrate' (I now realise they're in everything and that they're VITAL, but at the time this meant rice, potatoes, pasta etc) and one form of protein a day. You know, the works. 

Fast forward to now and I am so, SO much better than I was. I love food again, I can't remember the last time choosing what to eat for dinner resulted in a panic attack and I am slowly but surely repairing my relationship with both nutrition and my body. Genuinely. I am fucking proud of myself.

A lot of it has had to do with shifting my focus from weight loss and control to what I believe is 'healthy' for an adult body like mine - a mix of strength, cardio and flexibility exercise that I enjoy and wholesome, delicious food (and not-so-wholesome food too. Because, you know, eating should be FUN.) But anyway, I've strength trained at the gym for a couple years with varying success but just recently I started a brilliant, totally body/fitness-positive strength plan (Lucy Mountain's 'nobs guide' if anyone is interested), and thought that because I'm in a good head space right now I'd have a little look at how much I typically consume in a day energy-wise, because I know eating sufficient calories and protein helps you grow stronger, which is ultimately what I want from the plan. 

Holy moly. I may have come a long way but I've been way off intuiting how much I 'should' eat. I'm a 5'7 woman with a healthy weight and my typical daily intake was still way off shocked me because I felt like I had been so much more generous and loving with my body than I was as a teen.

So bottom line is, I'm trying to eat more of the food I love than ever before to support my damn body as it learns to move well and lift heavy stuff. 💪 But because of where I've come from mentally, I also can't help but be a little bit nervous. It's hard to tell yourself that more food can wonderful and healthy and as I'm sure lots of you know it's even harder to trust that you know how to nourish yourself well and forget all the 'metrics' and tracking completely. Basically I just want to know if anyone else has been in the same boat and maybe chat to some like-minded people.

Everyone in my life is caught up trying to cut carbs and intermittent fast, and that might be totally fine for them... but it's not me, and I idk, I just wanna talk. 💖",1586840748.0

I needed something I can only find at my local health food store so I went there and browsed a bit. I got a huge bunch of local kale because it looked fresh and delicious and I was craving some sauteed greens, and a few other veggies. I got some cassava flour rolls from my favorite local baker. I got a vegan carrot cake cupcake.

Then I went to the regular grocery store. I got Dr. Pepper, Ritz crackers, Chex mix, hummus, and some frozen dinners.

A year ago I would've been so conflicted on the second trip. I was ""so good"" at the first store, why am I buying junk food now? I would've shamefully walked to the checkout and felt the cashier judging me the whole time. I would've eaten all the crackers and sworn to never buy them again. 

Instead I got home, ate some crackers and hummus, and put the Dr. Pepper in the fridge. Soda is a weird one for me - I didn't drink it for 10 years and now I see it in the fridge but I haven't wanted to drink it but it's there if I want it, which I do sometimes. I used to refuse to buy store bought hummus because of all the oil, but I've just not been in the mood to put a ton of effort into food lately (even though I'll argue that homemade is soooo much better tasting).

I guess my point is...I used to try to justify shopping trips like this that they were about ""balance"" and ""moderation"" but like ...it's just food!

Edit/ in response to the person in the comments who deleted their post: 

Ok to be more constructive now. 

Yes, some foods are objectively more nutritious than others. I was talking about the moral value with food. How we beat ourselves up for eating ice cream because it's ~bad~ or judge people for eating McDonald's. But I don't feel any better mentally when I eat nothing but healthy foods, because it's not always what I want to eat. If I'm restricting what I eat to ONLY healthy foods, that's not good for my mental health at all. If you want to eat healthy food all day because that's what you're craving, go for it. But I like chips and soda. I also like kale salad and sprouted wheat bread. 

I no longer ""watch what I eat"" because it's a slippery slope to becoming obsessed with what I eat. If you're not that kind of person, good for you and I'm genuinely happy for you.",1586612630.0

Since I was a teenager, I’ve had to buy some new shorts every summer.

At the beginning of summer, I would always try on my shorts from last year to see if they fit. When they didn’t, the feelings that accompanied that were usually feelings of guilt, failure, panic, despair and then many many thoughts about what I was going to do to lose weight. Those thoughts were there constantly, non-stop. They consumed almost all of my brain power.

Sometimes, it would feel like a success because I had worked so hard to grow the booty and needing new shorts must of meant I was successful. But still, I was never satisfied and negative thoughts always came.

I’m telling you all this because I ran out of clean pyjama and sweat pants today (lol) and had to put on jeans to bring my dog out for a walk. My jeans are a bit snug right now.

But that doesn’t mean I need to lose weight. It means that when they don’t feel comfortable for me anymore, I can go get some new jeans. (I know I have the privilege to be able to do that most of the time and that it’s not a possibility for everyone).

If I give her a roughly normal amount of food every day, her weight stays about the same, but I can't just leave her food out for her. What I'm wondering is, if humans are able to regulate our eating with unrestricted access to food, why does my cat, and all my family's cats, eat too much and get much bigger unless we control their food intake for them? Is it boredom or stress from being inside all the time, or do they not have the ability to naturally eat intuitively? Do cats or dogs have weight set points, too?

Since we got another cat, she's been stealing food from her and gaining weight, so now I've gotta consider feeding them separately and putting my cat on a diet.

I have no idea what distance I ran, what my pace was, how many calories I burned, the route I took or how long exactly I was running. I don’t know how many times I stopped to walk, sped up or how many times I slowed down.

There’s nothing wrong with tracking your runs from time to time, especially if you signed up for a race or like setting performance goals for some of your runs. I take it like tracking the amount of weight you’re lifting in the gym.

But, it shouldn’t become obsessive. If you can’t go on a run without tracking your run, you might have to re-evaluate your relationship with running.

3 years ago I ran a half-marathon and I haven’t run consistently since. However, when I did run, I always tracked my runs. I think it was more out of habit than anything as I didn’t really pay close attention to the information on my watch. But I did look at it.

It felt liberating to run however long felt good for my body and go at a pace that felt good. When my dog stopped to smell something I didn’t get mad at her for affecting my running pace and time.

He bought 5 or 6 boxes of girl scout cookies that he ate within a week because he wanted to go back on keto the next week and didn't want them in the house. He frequently tells me I need to get all my ""junk"" food out of the house and ""we"" need to eat healthier. 

I've mostly healed my relationship with food and his behavior and mindset has been driving me crazy lately. It's worse now because I'm trying not to leave the house and yet he's making random trips to the store several times a week because he's eating entire bags of chips in a day and insists he needs this or that food right now. 

I'm not trying to shame anyone but it's rough being an observer to this when I work so hard to have a healthy relationship with food and my body.",1585433690.0
My mom has started counting calories again.,56,fqd07l,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/fqd07l/my_mom_has_started_counting_calories_again/,11,"The woman who has had bariatric surgery and failed to keep the weight off,

Who has attempted Weight Watchers time and time again,

I told her, ""Mom, maybe your set point is right where it's supposed to be,"" and she said that if she couldn't control her circumstances around COVID19, she could at least control her eating.

I am a liar because I don't really believe in set point, but I'd rather lie to my mom than watch her try and fail again. She said she wanted to lose her blubber. Her word, not mine, like she was a marine mammal, like her body was a walrus or whale and not a chubby grandma's body.

I have an eating disorder, and so does she. They're different yet alike. Genetic heritability plays a role, and my own madness and sorrow is a blurry reflection of a woman who loves baking and eats her feelings. I starve myself and exercise purge and flagellate myself with a whip of words. Sometimes, I cry when I see myself in the mirror. Does my mom do that, too? The thought of her crying hurts more than an empty belly churning acid. I want her to stop striving, to cease the suffering that has plagued her for forty-plus years.

It's can handle the torment of starvation. I am a tough, stoic man, and my agony is locked within, and my brain is its a prisoner with a cell and the keys. The pain exists inside. My mom's pain is inside and outside, too, like when diet culture told her to instruct a surgeon to snip-snap her stomach into a tiny little pouch that fiercely aches when she overeats.

They mentioned that she was average height and weight, so around 100-120 lbs. This irritated me so much because at least in the US (where this podcast is from) the average weight for a woman is 170 lbs. The reason it irritates me is that all through college whenever a man would make a comment about my weight (believe me it happened) they would always guess that I weighed 110 -120 lbs. Diet culture has ingrained into our brains that this is what women ought to weigh so much, that men now assume if you look good you must weigh 120 lbs. But what this does is when men guess that you weigh 110-120 lbs, when you really weigh 145 lbs it makes you stop and question why you don't weigh 120 lbs.

It’s been helpful for me to turn to books for reassurance that staying on an antidiet path is worthwhile. Obviously there are many books in this area that lots of us have heard of, but if you have any particular recommendations, drop them below!

Mine are:

“Happy Fat” by Sofie Hagen - A great read to help understand the importance of fat activism and the ways fatphobia manifests in sneaky ways. Also very funny!

“Sick Enough” by Jennifer Gaudiani - Gaudiani is an eating disorder treatment physician and she explains the negative physical effects of restricting and bingeing. A bit more technical, but super informative and still readable by the average person.

“Anti-diet” by Christy Harrison - I’m in the middle of this one now but I’m really enjoying it. I’ve been a fan of Harrison’s podcast for years, and this book is just as good. A very comprehensive and well-researched guide that’s helpful for both people new to the philosophy and those familiar with it.

I'm also 1 year into recovery from a restrictive eating disorder, but due to such a long history I also feel sick when I *do* eat. Recovery has gotten to the point where it's not so strict anymore, I don't have to eat all day as my weight has maintained for a few months now and I just need to listen to my body and make sure I eat enough. Which for me is where the problem lies: I feel sick if I do eat, and I feel sick if I don't eat but also don't let myself fall back into ED habits. Will this ever go away? Will I ever make it to a point where I can eat and not feel sick, so I know that if I feel that way it's because I'm hungry? Will the temptation to return to my eating disorder because at least then I felt good and in control ever go away?

I know that sticking with it is important, and I know it can take a long time to fix everything, but it's been a little over a year and I have felt sick every single day. I have tried so many things, so many different combinations of food and liquid and movement (gentle of course), it feels like I've tried everything and I know some of what makes it worse but I can't figure out what makes it better.

Post-surgery struggles,15,ffblxu,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ffblxu/postsurgery_struggles/,4,"Thought I would post about this here because this community is so supportive. I was admitted to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy a little over a week ago and one of the hardest parts of recovering from that procedure is not being able to move my body.

I’ve posted on here before about my journey to find peace with food and movement after an ED, and while I generally feel like I’ve made significant progress, it’s hard not to feel like this is going to set me back. For me now, exercising is more about the mental benefits. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and daily movement (along with my meds) really helps me keep that under control. But for a long time, I was using disordered eating and exercise as a way to numb those feelings and control them. I feel like I have a much healthier approach now; I don’t workout for hours on end like I used to, and I like to have a variety of kinds of exercise throughout my week (barre, running, yoga, walking), but I’m usually active 5-6 days a week.

Lately, I’ve been feeling those old ED thoughts creeping in, telling me it’s not okay to have this much time away from exercise. Obviously, I’m not going to push myself to workout before my body is ready, but it’s been really hard to sit with those thoughts when I’m stuck at home all day recovering from surgery.

I know I have the tools this time around to stop myself from slipping back into disorder, but I still worry that once I’m back to normal activity, it will be hard to keep those behaviors in check, that I might overcompensate for all the time I had to spend resting.

I'm pissed that the WW (formerly Weight Watchers®) Instagram attempts to look all cute and relatable and actually co-opts antidiet/IE language,46,fcbhqv,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/fcbhqv/im_pissed_that_the_ww_formerly_weight_watchers/,11,"Yes, I know I've been making a lot of posts recently, but this angers me so much that I had to get this off of my chest. 

If you check their Instagram, they post things ""What kind of air fryer are you based on your birth month?"" And they post quotes like: ""You are enough just as you are--even if you think it should be different."" And they posted this quote after posting a before and after weight loss pic. Hypocritical much, huh? 

They actually post memes that are like ""chocolate is my relationship status,"" and there's another meme about how you could eat pizza and pasta and pie and potatoes and pepperoni on WW (formerly Weight Watchers®). Uhm...you can't really if it goes beyond your points. And there's a quote about never giving up things you love. But what if you love the idea of not having to worry about food all the time? I'm pretty sure that that's something you have to give up with WW  (formerly Weight Watchers®).

It's both hilarious and sad how they're co-opting anti-diet ""eat what you want"" and ""love yourself"" language while being the evil corporation that they are. Let's not forget that they put out a weight loss app for kids. FOR KIDS. 

They try to look so cute and funny and relatable, but they have fueled so many EDs and teach you how to have an unhealthy relationship with food. And they make their money off of returning customers.

I was searching for anti-WW posts and articles (and found many), and I saw a comment that said something like ""Every long term Weight Watcher I've treated had a daughter with an ED."" And I thought: ""Oh of course."" 

Given what my mom is doing to me right now (I wrote about it in two of my recent posts on here), it makes total sense. Even though she wasn't on WW back then, my mom had exposed me to diet culture from when I was a young age and I had been dieting for fifteen years before discovered IE. Had my mom been on WW and done this to me when I was eight, things would have been so much worse. 

I hated them because they promote outdated low fat propaganda and I hated them because they're a corporation that makes money off of returning customers. I hated them because they released a Kurbo app for kids, but now I hate them so much more. I hated them even before they affected my life, but now they are finally making my own life miserable and it's so painful. My mom became a monster.

Reversing a saying,7,fbgpuz,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/fbgpuz/reversing_a_saying/,5,"There's a crappy saying that ""nothing tastes as good as skinny feels."" But being skinny isn't actually as great as the saying would have you believe. Because if you are afraid of gaining weight, the fear never goes away, no matter how skinny you get. And if you're ashamed of your larger body, you remain ashamed of a smaller body. You either fixate on small pockets of fat, or else skin folds or facial features or something like that. The shame just changes form. (If you don't believe me on this, just cruise the ED subs.)

The skinny ""feeling"" that the saying describes is the conviction of your own worthiness. Which shrinking your body can't give you. Because if you start with the premise that your body is bad, and make even the most massive effort to change it under that premise, the premise never changes.

But the good news is that this feeling of worthiness is available to us all, in the body we have right now. It's not a skinny feeling, it's the experience of unconditional self acceptance, which is available to any human body/mind. It's hard work, but unlike the work of losing weight, it actually brings something positive into our life.

So that's my stance on how skinny feels. Food, on the other hand...well that's just delicious.",1583000807.0

When your partner is still in diet culture...,11,fax1cs,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/fax1cs/when_your_partner_is_still_in_diet_culture/,4,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years and for most of that time, I've been in diet culture and restriction to some degree or another, and my husband has definitely been in it too.  We were both overweight kids who slimmed down in our late teens (through intentional weight loss), and definitely had a mutual desire not to return to our fat selves.  Our exact diet philosophies were somewhat different (he was very pro-fat and theoretically anti-carb, I was more of a ""let's restrict everything"" type), but we were both on board with the idea that weight gain was bad and that not gaining weight required vigilance and restriction.  At the same time, my husband has these ideas about restriction but he's terrible at enforcing them on himself (big surprise, right?).  Like he'll say he's going to cut out sugar completely and then I wake up in the morning to find a bunch of chocolate wrappers littering the table next to his recliner.  Or he'll say we need to go zero carb and then he'll want something like fried potatoes at dinner and when I say uh, I thought you didn't want carbs, he'll get irate and say fried potatoes are mostly fat so of course they're okay.  So basically he sets himself this strict diet goal, maybe sticks to it during the day, but by the time the evening rolls around it's all out the window, and then he's annoyed that he's ""fat"" (which, btw, is not even true!  The whole time we've known each other he's been in the lower half of the ""normal"" weight range for his height!).

&#x200B;

So, last year I got sick of dieting and shifted over to an IE approach.  My husband is both interested and skeptical.  He hates the idea of dieting and restricting and definitely wants to eat more ""naturally"".  Our shared meals have become tastier as I've lost my fear of cooking with fat and carbs, and he definitely likes that.  We keep more snack foods and chocolate around the house and I do think his after dinner binges have calmed down somewhat now that he knows those things are going to keep showing up.  But then one day he came into the kitchen and freaked out that I was making a pasta dish and was like ""what's with all these empty carbs, we are going to get FAT!"" (he did calm down after I actually walked him through the entire contents of the dish and assured him that the amount of pasta per person was actually pretty modest, but still...argh).  Another time recently we visited some friends, they had a baby about a year ago.  The husband has always been on the bigger side and since having the baby the wife has put on some weight also.  When we get home my husband turns to me and says ""we are never allowed to get that fat.  This Intuitive Eating thing and eat whatever you want is all well and good but there are serious health consequences to being that overweight"".  I was just so angry that he would say something like that!  Also, we have a young son who is technically ""obese"".  Our son is very active, eats a healthy diet, he's just...big.  My husband and I were both big kids so...surprise?  Well, periodically my husband gets annoyed at how much our son is eating and will be like ""he's obese and he's just sitting there plowing carbs"" (""carbs"" being a bowl of plain oatmeal with chopped apple).  This REALLY bothers me.  I feel like there are plenty of ways to talk to our kid about healthy eating that don't involve mentioning weight or shaming certain foods.

&#x200B;

Anyway, advice?  I did suggest that he read the IE book but he says I should just be able to explain it to him (but attempts at ""explaining"" it have just gotten very tense as he's always trying to pick holes in it).  I do think in some ways he wants to believe that IE ""works"", but he's definitely got a LOT of fatphobia and I don't think he really sees that there's anything wrong with being fatphobic (which I struggle with because I feel I've always been aware on some level that fatphobia \*is\* a problem and something you should be trying not to practice, even if I've not always done a good job of actually living that).",1582906409.0

There is a lot I like about my larger body now that I've stopped dieting, but I am so afraid of what is going to happen to me still. I went from xs to 1x in most things, still gaining although it *seems* like maybe it's slower, maybe I just can't tell because it takes more mass to switch between sizes. I'm having to deal with new sensations like back fat and large body folds. My limbs feel heavier, it is harder to walk freely, more difficult bend to get up, and I can no longer shop and know I can find my size anywhere. I can't cross my legs anymore. My feet hurt when I walk, and I am often as stiff and sore now as I was when I was exercising obsessively. I am unsure I am taking the right path. I've never been anywhere near this heavy in my life before. There is literally nothing from my old life that would fit me now except for my socks, some shoes and a baseball cap. A lot of people I have known would not even recognize me.

Can folks tell me how their weight stabilized, if it did, and how they were able to come to terms with who this new person is?  I often feel that I would rather die earlier of an eating disorder than die from isolation and shame and a body that I find it incredibly hard to accept or be proud of. I think about going back to my old restrictive/binge habits nearly every day.

In one year, we have gone from < 500 subscribers to > 4,000. We have 200 new subscribers since yesterday, as a matter of fact. **We are creating an active, thriving body-accepting, fat-accepting space on Reddit**, a site notoriously and viciously hostile to stigmatized bodies. This has not been done before, and the reason we're doing it now is because of you guys.

What I've seen on today's threads has been amazing. So many big-hearted, compassionate, self-aware thoughts. So much encouragement. So much sharing and vulnerability, even knowing that the peanut gallery out there seems to be weirdly obsessed with us this week. As a moderator, I would expect to have to take down at least one or two comments from our own community being hostile right back to the trolls, but I haven't seen anything like that. Just compassion and grace, really. This is a community of people who have done the work, and it shows.

Being anti-diet is pro-health,28,f8lqzy,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/f8lqzy/being_antidiet_is_prohealth/,14,"A lot of people out there like to strawman the anti-diet movement and HAES by saying ""Oh haha you just want to eat fried chicken and Oreos and Pringles all day."" And then some people make it sound like it's some kind of feederism movement which like...I hope they aren't being serious but who knows. 

Anyway, I would like to say that being anti-diet is about health. I'm anti-diet because I realized that diets are unhealthy.  The thing is that the pursuit of weight loss has not been shown to improve health LONG TERM, and even if one believes that health can be determined by weight alone, most dieters regain more weight than they lost. And so even if one views health from a solely weight centric perspective, intentional weight loss would still be unhealthy. 

I feel like people are so caught up in diets and diet culture that they don't see how one could adopt healthy behaviors while not trying to lose weight. And they don't see how someone could not diet and still not eat all day. I feel like these people are probably restricting so much themselves that they think that ""not dieting"" means bingeing on food all day. Intuitive Eating/HAES/antidiet are all about healing your relationship with food and your body. You can't heal your relationship with food and stop bingeing if you are restricting your food intake. I made a post about this a while ago. 

(Also I feel like these humans just don't understand how human bodies work. Like they think that your body will gain weight and just...not stop. They seem to believe that the human body is like some sort of garbage bag and the more food you put into the garbage bag, the larger it becomes. Human bodies don't work that way.)

Antidiet is about health. It's a holistic approach to health. That's where the HEALTH in Health At Every Size comes in. It's about trying to reach a point in which you stop restricting and bingeing, stop hating your body, ending weight stigma, exercising in a way that you find enjoyable, etc. I feel like these people are so indoctrinated by diet culture that they can't see health outside of a weight centric/food centric perspective.",1582518173.0

Why do pro-diet people act like diet culture isn't mainstream?,55,f5g0wv,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/f5g0wv/why_do_prodiet_people_act_like_diet_culture_isnt/,20,"They keep talking about how people need to be more ""educated"" about nutrition and weight loss, as if most people have never before heard anything like ""bread is bad for you"" or ""count your calories."" 

There was a post on r/nutrition a while back about how 50% of Americans will be ""obese"" in 2030 or something like that, and one of the top responses was ""There should be nutrition education in schools, and we shouldn't teach kids that pasta is healthy."" But the thing is that many ""overweight"" or ""obese"" people are deeply immersed in diet culture, and so it's not like people are ""just ignorant."" Negative body image and dieting have been shown to lead to weight gain long term, and so maybe living in a culture that prioritizes thinness and promotes caloric restriction is partially to blame.

I guess they just assume that just because people are ""overweight"" or ""obese"" means that people just don't know enough. They're like ""calorie counts on menus are good because they stop people from overeating and becoming obese."" But have ""obesity rates"" gone down since restaurants started doing that? 

If intentional weight loss were somehow the ""cure"" for ""obesity,"" we would see a decline in our ""obesity rates"" as diet culture becomes more and more mainstream. I have heard people irl talk about keto, Paleo, Dr. Michael Greger, Weight Watchers, intermittent fasting, Atkins, etc. I have never heard anyone at work talk about how they're learning to love themselves as they are and how they're exercising to improve their mood. At family gatherings during the holidays, I never hear people talk about intuitive eating and how they're trying not to feel guilty about eating donuts. They do, however, talk about how they're trying to lose weight. And ALL THE TIME. 

And yet people still insist that we ""educate"" more people about how ""sugar is a drug like cocaine."" Even if someone doesn't go on a diet, being fed diet culture propaganda still leads to disordered eating behaviors. A lot of people who are ""overeating"" are doing so because they're thinking about going on a diet someday in the future, and so if you tell them that they must break up with sugar in order to be healthy, you aren't helping anyone. 

Diet culture is mainstream, and if anything, it has contributed to the so called ""obesity epidemic."" But these people have the audacity to be like ""Oh no one has heard about how pasta is bad for you before, and only a handful of people out there in the world actually care to lose weight and haven't heard that being fat is unhealthy before.""

My therapist opened my eyes regarding dieting!,49,f4ou9x,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/f4ou9x/my_therapist_opened_my_eyes_regarding_dieting/,4,"Hi, I'm new here! I've joined this subreddit because I've recently had an appointment with my therapist where we discussed my struggle with dieting. 

Once I was on the brink of fatty liver disease so, with great effort, I lost 10kg. After that my doctor checked my liver values again and they were all in range, even better from where they were before I had gained the weight. She said I could maintain this weight and would be fine as I was not that overweight to begin with. However, for some reason my perfectionism and extremely high expectations for myself took over and I wanted to lose more weight to be 45kg. And that began a cycle of restrictive eating, giving up on it, binging and gaining all the weight back. I could not whatsoever get below 60kg, whenever I got close it would seem like I self-sabotaged by overeating. 

I told my therapist about this cycle that I had gotten stuck in and she explained to me that the constant state of hunger I was in, in addition to the CPTSD that I'm actually seeing counsel for, caused my body immense stress and thus came with all the adverse effects that stress has on the body. Guess what can be one of those adverse effects? Overeating or undereating. 

So after that appointment I thought about what I wanted to do and decided on radical self-love. This meant trusting my body and eating what it wanted when it wanted it and in whatever quantity it wanted it. I've started eating more, aka normal portions. I eat when I'm hungry and until I'm no longer hungry. My meals actually consist of a proper amount of calories now rather than the 200 calories per meal I was living off before. 

Ever since that appointment I've let go of the diet mentality and started loving my body. I'm not experiencing any adverse health effects from my weight anyway so why should I force myself to diet to a weight where I would be considered underweight?! Makes no sense. This morning I looked in the mirror and noticed that I was thinner. I don't weigh myself often anymore but hopping on the scale it said that I had indeed lost a little bit of weight - without feeling deprived or hungry at any time!  

So I've come to realize that the diet mentality is a bad one to have, even under the guise of a ""lifestyle change"" instead of a diet. For most of us our bodies know what they need and when they need it and if we listen to the cues we'll be just fine. No need to obsessively count calories or restrict to being constantly hungry. I've started to practice other acts of self-love and self-care as well, which help with my depressive episodes just as much. Started practicing mindfulness and praying. Started being actually ok with who I am. 

And I'm feeling better than ever before. 

So yeah, fuck diets and the diet cycle. We're not meant to be starving and stressed all the time. My body knows what it needs. I can let go and trust in myself and I'll be just fine.",1581848127.0

I gave up. I started eating breakfast. Added some more carbs. Started working out consistently. I haven’t felt this good in years. Certainly not when I was following keto/IF.

Proud of my anti-diet progress,37,f11mbx,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/f11mbx/proud_of_my_antidiet_progress/,8,"I started listening to Food Psych about 1.5 years ago, and read Intuitive Eating last January. At the time, the idea of trusting what I found myself *wanting* to eat without some plan dictating macros or calories seemed literally impossible. Every time I wanted to eat something ""unhealthy"" or even ""healthy"" but more carby, like an apple, I would deliberate for at least ten minutes about whether I actually wanted the food, or if I thought I wanted it because I had been dieting, or if I actually wanted it because I had been dieting and I needed it...the circular thinking went on and on. 

I realized today that now I just...eat what I'm hungry for. It changes based on my level of activity or how well I slept or what the weather is like outside. Sometimes my hunger deviates from the pattern, and I'm...surprisingly cool with just letting myself have a snack or hell, a meal, that I hadn't planned on. Guilt over certain foods still creeps up, but I've gotten pretty good about catching myself in the act, reminding myself that morality isn't attached to different foods, and moving on with my life. 

The most interesting part about eating intuitively is that I can notice *without judgment* how certain foods make me feel at different times, and use that knowledge to grocery shop or plan meals in a way that has improved my sleep, my energy levels, and my attention span. For example, a bigger lunch with a mix of protein, veg, and fats keeps me from getting irritably hungry around 3 p.m., and making sure I eat some carbs with dinner has 1000% helped my insomnia. I feel so much less exhausted, and I don't spend half of my waking hours looking up low-calorie recipes or re-calculating my macros or deliberating over whether I can eat a square of dark chocolate after dinner if I ""splurge"" by adding half an avocado to my dry kale salad.

I'm tired of seeing 1500 calories marketed as totally normal and healthy, tired of seeing articles and posts about how if a woman eats more than 2000, 2500 etc calories she's going to gain weight and be unhealthy. I'm tired of people not being able to see the reality that the 10 lbs they lose on restrictive diets are either going to come back or spiral them into an eating disorder. As someone who was told to lose weight by a Dr because I was 5 lbs overweight at 12 (due to a temporary medication I NEEDED to be on at the time, but came with the side effect of increased appetite) and then spent the next 10 years of my life in hell, hospitalized for anorexia, suspended from university due to eating issues and dangerous weight loss, anxiety that was traumatic beyond words due to all I'd been inundated with my entire life from people/the internet/etc about calories/diets/weight/etc. I just want to say I'm honestly happy now I can look back on it all with laughter (but at times, relentless frustration and anger and pain).

When I think about how this whole system basically exists to make you feel like shit, DESTROY your health (low calorie diets ARE. NOT. HEALTHY. Feeding your body less than it needs to function well \[and for most people that is well above 2000 calories\] IS NOT HEALTHY), think you're a pig and feel shame for overeating because what we're told is healthy is way too low for the majority of people, and keep you a slave, it makes my blood boil. It either leads to feeling like you are out of control and binge eating (hint, this is your body trying to keep you healthy and alive- there is nothing wrong with you. you are not disgusting or flawed.) or a half-life of restriction and low energy. I'M FUCKING TIRED.

&#x200B;

Don't let anyone, anything, any system, any one, make you feel bad for eating however makes you feel good and nourished. Our bodies are not faulty systems that want to make us fat. That only happens when we rebel against what is healthy and abuse them. I'm finally at a point where I don't feel guilty for being a tall woman who NEEDS to eat amounts far far far above what I'm told is 'healthy' to maintain my weight and health. And the funny thing is, I AM thin (not that it matters, AT ALL) yet still am made to feel bad that I don't prescribe to what this whole messed up system tells me I need.

If metabolic adaptation weren't real, then following a 1200 calorie diet would be deadly long term. It's not deadly, and that's only because metabolic adaption is real. (Obviously it's not a good idea to follow a 1200 calorie diet long term, but my point is that it's not deadly.) 

**""Sugar is an addictive substance like cocaine""** AND **""People who binge lack willlpower""**: If sugar were an addictive substance like cocaine (it's not, but imagine if it were), then how does it make any sense to tell someone to ""just practice willpower around sugar""? Almost everyone was given sugar as a child, and so if it were an addictive substance like cocaine, how could they blame people for ""being addicted to sugar"" as adults? You wouldn't tell someone who grew up around drugs that they ""just lack willpower."" 

**""If you stopped losing weight, it's because you are miscalculating your caloric intake""** AND **""People at lower weights need less calories to maintain""**: They claim that your body won't ever adapt to this new amount and that you will continuously lose weight if you keep up with it, and that it's your fault if you reach a point at which you stop losing weight. And yet they simultaneously believe that you will need less calories to maintain if you're at a lower weight, but if someone loses weight, I'm pretty sure that they'll...be at a lower weight than they were before. And yet they're still told that it's their fault if their body stopped losing weight at what was previously a caloric deficit. Our energy expenditure reduces as a result of caloric restriction, but even though many do believe that this is a myth, the idea that people of lower weights need less calories should also explain why someone would stop losing weight. Apparently it doesn't for them and it's still the dieter's fault. 

**""If you stopped losing weight, it's because you are miscalculating your caloric intake""** and **""Humans can survive on very little food""** actually contradict each other as well, but the former sort of ties into the idea that metabolic adaptation isn't real. If you were consuming 1500 calories a day and if the only thing stopping you from losing more weight were that you were miscalculating your caloric intake, then 1500 calories a day would not be safe long term.

Halo Top makes my blood boil,85,ezc7ow,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/ezc7ow/halo_top_makes_my_blood_boil/,35,"This lame excuse for ice cream tastes AWFUL, and yet people eat it all the time and it only gets a pass because it's low calorie. My dad is an ice cream snob, and yet he won't criticize Halo Top because it's ""healthy"" and so it's excused. I'm sorry but ice cream shouldn't taste like shit. 

I was just watching a YouTube video about Halo Top (it was in my recommended idk why), and this registered dietician (didn't seem like an HAES-inclusive dietician but she had a point) said that it encourages binge eating because their slogan is ""stop when you hit the bottom."" Yeah it totally does encourage bingeing and I've always thought this myself. But then the guy who invented Halo Top started talking about how ""sugar is like cocaine"" and so it's ""impossible"" to stop. But guess what? You probably won't feel that way if you didn't restrict to begin with. Once I stopped restricting, I started forgetting that ice cream even exists. There's little evidence to suggest that sugar is an addictive substance. 

I hate everything about it. It tastes bad, has a terrible texture and it's binge-encouraging diet culture shit that feeds off of the idea that humans can't trust their bodies. Yes, even those who binge can reach a point in which they stop, but in order to stop bingeing, one has to quiet the food police (although it's not an overnight fix). 

In this YouTube clip, people were like ""Oh I can't believe this whole pint has 280 calories."" You'd think that based on these people's reactions that Halo Top tastes like normal ice cream. It's garbage. And I've even heard people irl say that it's ""good,"" but if the pints didn't have the calorie counts on the front, they'd probably be like: ""Why does this ice cream taste so terrible?"" Some of their flavors aren't even remotely decent.

I was really kind of shocked.  My doctor's office has overall seemed pretty chill.  A few years ago I had a health diagnosis that they could have easily responded to with ""lose weight"" and instead they said ""you can best treat this through changes to diet and exercise"" and then kind of left it up to me to decide how to do that.  My son goes to the same practice and he (my son) is technically overweight (he's also 3 and has visible ab muscles, so....very much in the BMI is bullshit category) and his pediatrician has honestly I think walked the line between needing to ask some questions (to make sure there isn't a red ""endocrine disorder!!!"" flag waving in the background) while not implying there is anything wrong, pretty well.

Okay so my mom, who I love dearly, is really grating my last nerve. We’re larger bodied women, and my mom had gastric bypass when I was very young. Like you’d expect, now that she’s over 10 years out, she’s gained a lot of the weight back and kept all of the complications (I.e. malabsorption, dumping syndrome, etc.). We also have a history of diabetes in our family, and my mom is starting to show signs of this setting in. She has an at home glucose monitor and her blood sugar is well above the normal range but, she REFUSES to take medicine. She’s positive that if she takes medicine she’ll enter into a “pharma-cycle” and end up having to take hundreds of pills a day. So, she’s decided that she can fix this with a diet or ~lifestyle~ change. She tried eating keto, it wasn’t sustainable. She did IF, not sustainable. Not she’s doing plant based, and her blood sugar is actually getting higher. So this morning she was ranting to me about how discouraged she is and how upset she is because nothing is working and her new plan is to try vegetarian keto.

I love my mom but this is all so triggering to me as a recovering bulimic, and I just want to tell her that none of this will work!!! She’s convinced that being fat means she failed somehow, and that’s so not true! Idk what to do. I can’t even get her to listen to me",1580576513.0

If you want to truly be anti-diet.....


You MUST confront your internalized fatphobia.  

There are way too many people who have joined this sub who haven’t read the resources( which are conveniently listed at the top), and who come here either intentionally or not to say they are: “Totally super 💯 anti-diet...except that I don’t agree with(insert diet-culture dogma dujour)”

This isn’t about the trolls who will come regardless for the lolz. 

I am genuinely trying to reach the folx who feel they belong here.  

Why do you bristle at the thought of someone “eating whatever they want”?  

Why do you feel that Intuitive eating is only ok as long as it’s all “in moderation”?

I don’t know how else to say it friends:

The answer is on some level you do not trust HAES, or intuitive eating.  

On some level you really have internalized that we will all just be out of control forever.  

Why is that scary?  

Really think about it. 

It’s terrifying because you are AFRAID to be FAT, and you have to keep asking yourself WHY you have that reaction. 

There are no ways around this friends. If you really want to come to anti-diet, and true intuitive eating you have to recognize that being afraid of being fat is a problem that we all share.

As long as you believe that there are sizes that are ok, and sizes that aren’t: you are still entrenched in diet culture.

Recognize that fat bodies(even fat bodies that move joyfully and eat “well”) are judged the second they pop ONE Oreo in their mouth by our culture. Even if that is the only “processed sugar” they have had all week.  

Our culture is punishing large bodies every minute of every day. So here we ask people to challenge the “food police” as per intuitive eating principles(which you can read about). Lots of people come here after years of disordered eating, and need to heal their relationship to food, and their relationship to themselves. They don’t need help adding to the already internalized guilt and shame.

We HAVE to be on the side of large bodies.  It isn’t an Accident that the majority of outspoken anti-diet  celebrities/authors are straight-sized(Even Caroline Dooner, who I love, is fairly thin naturally).  

It’s EASIER to reject diet culture if you aren’t plus-size already.   It’s only recently that amazing artists like Lizzo(who hired all thicc and plus-size dancers for her show at the Grammy’s) are showing that fat-bodies can be just as healthy, sexy, and fit as straight-size bodies.

If the thought of happy fat people who are living their best life being sexy and wonderful and loved makes you cringe: you need to LOOK AT THAT.

*ETA*

I do not want this to be mistaken for shaming our folx who are wresting with very recent ED.  

You are where you are.  I hope you can see that the aim here is to investigate our internalized fatphobia, rather than pretend it isn’t running the show. Because all of us struggle with it on some level.  If we didn’t: Intuitive Eating, and accepting our bodies would be a given.",1580475881.0

My problem is that I still want to lose weight, kind of? 

I ride horses. I'm currently in school for my bachelor's in equine science, and I'm trying out for the equestrian team this Fall. I have been riding for over 18 years now, so I'm fairly experienced, which means I have good control over my body, so that my weight is evenly distributed and doesn't affect my horse. 

That being said, there are some advantages to weighing less, mainly that it increases the number of horses that are 'safe' for me to ride. 

On average, a horse should only carry 20% of it's own weight, including tack. This means that a 1000# horse can safely carry 200#. Obviously, this doesn't take rider experience and ability into account, but it's the general rule of thumb.

They keep bringing up that the food industry is worth more than the diet industry, as if to say that being anti-diet isn't ""radical"" and is pro-capitalism or something, but the thing is that ""Big Food"" and Big Diet aren't two separate industries. 

There is Halo Top ice cream and there are and Quest Bars, but I haven't seen ""HAES ice cream"" or ""Intuitive Eating bars.""

I think that people don't understand that giving yourself unconditional permission to eat all foods is not the same as eating all day.

I do eat snacks most days, but I think if one is trying to ""eat healthy,"" they're more prone to having night binges and so they're more likely finish these snacks quicker than they would if they were to be living a non-diet lifestyle.

Making My Own Clothes and I Finally Found a Joyful Movement Activity,45,etthoh,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/etthoh/making_my_own_clothes_and_i_finally_found_a/,10,"I've been meaning to make this post for awhile. I wanted to share two things that have really helped me  with intuitive eating and body acceptance.

The first is making my own clothes. Because the sizing in patterns is based on actual body measurements (which is the most potentially triggering aspect--I've come to think of it like a recipe: you wouldn't be upset that a recipe calls for 3 cups of flour to make a cake the correct way instead of 2, so why be upset that your body has a certain measurement that needs to be taken into account for a garment to fit correctly?), and most patterns will have some sort of finished garment measurement, it takes out a large amount of the guesswork that always came with buying ready to wear clothing for me. 

Buying clothing online was always an absolute nightmare, as I usually had to purchase 2 different sizes of every item in order to see which one would fit better. I also became increasingly disillusioned with brands adding a plus-size range, but then only carrying them online.  Although I'm still very much a beginner sewist, the freedom that has come from being able to adjust clothing patterns to fit my body is amazing. Having control over how clothing makes my body look has done a lot toward helping me accept and feel confident in it. It was never my body that was the problem--it was the clothes.

The second is FINALLY finding a joyful movement activity that I enjoy. I genuinely hated exercise/movement. After years of only doing it in a negative way, I had stopped completely. I would rather do anything else other than exercise. Then I saw some people reviewing the game Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch. I used to really enjoy playing Dance Dance Revolution on the PS2 back in the day, but I haven't liked any movement games since then. I didn't have a switch, and was concerned about spending close to $400 to be able to get one and the Ring Fit game. Luckily, my younger brother has one, and he let me borrow it when I saw him at Christmas. It's SO. MUCH. FUN. And while there is some mildly diet-culture-y stuff in it, it's very neutral for the most part. I think it probably has to be neutral to avoid lawsuits, but it does talk about different elements of wellness, including making sure you get enough sleep. It's never shamed me when I've come back after a week of not doing it, and it regularly tells you not to overdo it, to make sure you're staying hydrated, and even asks if you'd ""Like to quit here so you can come back ready tomorrow"" (or something like that). It's just so nice to have such a fun, non-judgmental movement option that I can do at home after years of guilt around and hatred of exercise/movement.

 A couple of important things to mention: it does calculate the ""calories burned"" and asks for you to enter your weight when you're setting it up (in order to calculate the caloric burn). I haven't weighed myself in over a year, but have been at a stable place as far as I can tell, so I just estimated. I honestly don't care about the ""calories burned"", so I probably could have just entered any random number, but it honestly didn't occur to me. I also think I'm in a place where I don't care if it knows around how much I weigh. So far it hasn't said anything about my weight or asked me to re-enter it, so it doesn't seem to be focused on weight loss in any way. I'm also far enough in my antidiet/intuitive eating practice that those things don't impact me like they used to. The character in the game is also very slim/muscular, with no ability to customize outside of eye and skin color, so that's something to consider. The only specific thing I remember seeing so far that's made me roll my eyes was some text on the cool-down screen that said something to the effect of ""Cucumbers are tasty and low in calories!"".  So, this game still has elements of diet culture, but not to the extent that other exercise options seem to have. If you're at the point where you feel you're able to incorporate some joyful movement into your life and haven't had any luck with finding something you actually enjoy doing, this might be a good option!

I just wanted to share my experience thus far, and hope it might help others like this subreddit has helped me.",1579972677.0
"I hate the phrase ""different diets work for different people""",39,etdtbx,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/etdtbx/i_hate_the_phrase_different_diets_work_for/,31,"Or at least the context in which it is used. If it meant ""some people are happier with more carbs in their diets"" or ""some people have diabetes and so they have to eat accordingly,"" then that would be okay. 

Whenever someone talks about how a particular diet failed them or caused long term issues, people say, ""Different diets work for different people."" The thing is that all weight loss diets involve restriction and are pretty much just CICO diets. For example, people will lose weight (at least short term) on vastly different diets because they're just...eating less food. I think I sort of ""peaked"" (as in realized that most diets are CICO diets) when people were promoting plant based diets for the sake of weight loss and said that coconut oil is ""fattening,"" for I myself had lost weight (temporarily ofc) after doing Paleo. 

The inherently restrictive nature of diets is why they don't work. And so if Paleo won't work, then the Alkaline diet won't work and plain old CICO won't work either. Your body knows that you're restricting whether or not your meals consist of quinoa or Paleo pancakes. 

And what's also super dumb about this phrase is that there aren't really any people who stick to any particular diet long term. I myself did Paleo for two months of my life, and I've done Paleo for longer than anyone I know. Like I don't know anyone who has been on any one particular fad diet for ten years and says that it has ""worked"" for them. Do these people know a large portion of people who have followed any particular diet long term? I've never ever met anyone who was like ""I went on the Ornish diet thirty years ago, and I haven't turned back ever since."" 

Most people who go on fad diets just constantly yoyo diet and never ever ""find the right one."" I think people use this phrase because it makes dieting seem less sketchy than it actually is. It's like ""Oh diets are totally not a scam. You just need to find the right one the same you need to find the right therapist or right meds."" But the thing is...most diets are pretty much the same thing and work the same way. I think the people whose diets are ""working"" are mostly the ones who just started their diets lol. 

Caloric restriction reduces energy expenditure, messes with hunger hormones and increases cortisol levels. The method by which one reduces their caloric intake doesn't matter. This doesn't just apply to fad diets; this applies to any sort of restrictive eating (ETA: that is any sort of restrictive eating that is in pursuit of weight loss).",1579888095.0

Two, is that it is clearly making her obsessed with food. She keeps bringing the diet up repeatedly even though the other nurses keep replying in a disinterested way. One thing I know after getting cancer is that I don’t have time for focusing on food to the exclusion of everything else in life. 

Third is that you can be a health professional and totally miss that dieting encourages unhealthy disordered behavior. This is the same woman who is making sure I’m eating regularly to keep up my strength during treatment. I get weighed every time I come in to make sure that I’m maintaining my (already quite high) weight. There must be a lot of cognitive dissonance for her to starve herself while asking if my appetite is still good. 

Finally, so much of this is rooted in punishment and self-hatred. My nurse is currently listing off areas of her body where she wants to be smaller, despite clearly fitting into a size small set of scrubs. She is announcing in a semi-public area how much she hates her “fat knees” It’s normalized in diet culture to be self-critical and put yourself down. 

Anyway, I wanted to share my thoughts here because it can still be hard to listen to people who are dieting. Especially when they are in smaller bodies. It’s hard not to hear, “I’m doing everything in my power not to look like you” But when I think about how much calmer my mind is around food and how happy I’ve been to quit dieting for good, it’s easier to see how diet culture is really unhealthy.",1579801479.0

On my quest to love the body I have: I have been culling old clothes.

But there is this ONE Dress.  You know the one. That dress you bought back when you were still immersed in diet culture, and it was your gift to show off your new, starvation-won body in. *(Editing to add)* I was working out 4 hours or more a day, and barely eating to get this way. There was nothing healthy about it. I feel good about the way I look, and I’m definitely healthier now: just bigger than I was. 

Well: here is the kicker.  The dress is this stretchy fabric, so it technically still fits. It doesn’t look bad on me either. HOWEVER...I have photos of what I looked like in the dress before, and so I have some emotion around that.

I know that I should just get rid of it, but I am having SO. MUCH. TROUBLE letting it go with gratitude. 

If I knew where to find this dress, I would just buy it in a larger size, because I really like it otherwise.

Fitness and not triggering dieting?,14,es5949,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/es5949/fitness_and_not_triggering_dieting/,12,"I'm new, posting this on a few places to just to get some feedback...I just read The Fuck It Diet and it really resonated with me! I know it takes time to reach nuetrality around food (that it's a process... You probably don't just arrive and scream COOL I'M DONE ALL GOOD HERE). 

One thing I'm struggling with is missing being in better physical fitness. I was absolutely doing unhealthy shit with food when I was much stronger and fitter...doing bootcamps on an empty stomach, 5 HIIT workouts a week on 1200 calories a day, etc. So I'm not condoning it. But I WAS strong and had a much lower resting heart rate. Of course it wasn't worth the crash and binge cycle it triggered. 

I've been wondering about a kindof... Disdain? Contempt? In some HAES/fat lib circles for athleticism...like running a marathon, for example, is a sick fantasy or literally torture. Like there's something inherently wrong with endurance running or...Lizzo is obviously an athlete on a high level! I would love to have her cardio capability...

Does anyone have tips on approaching fitness and training without triggering dieting mentality and restriction and bad vibes??? It feels so impossible. Are there stories of people who legitimately run marathons and love it (I want to love long hard workouts... They feel good! It's feels great to be a good runner or rock climber etc) without getting all overthinky about food or weight or ""loving every movement"" etc? Who recovered from food obsession but have a training schedule they love and are proud of? Are there resources out there for fat athletes, yoga teachers, etc? 

I know the way out is through... Just trying to think through this. Thanks all!",1579659330.0

Tw diet, keto, calorie counting

I just got a new job that I'm very excited about, I like all my coworkers so far but I'm having a hard time with my department. They are all incredibly diet minded, and there was 3 different 5-20 minute conversations about their different diets and macros and calories. They all looked at me for input and asked me what I'm doing, I'm a curvy tall girl, so I MUST be dieting of course. I just said I worked out sometimes and I'm trying to be more plant based, leaving out the fact that it's not diet related really. 

 I nodded along and all but it did pull me right back into my old mindset again :(. I used to diet on and off over the last 10 years and just quit 3 months ago. Im trying to eat intuitively and not criticize myself so much, and even though I've gained back 8 pounds I've become much more comfortable in my body.

"Ever notice how many diets are repackaged versions of older diets? And even then they're marked as ""revolutionary.""",74,eqpjit,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/eqpjit/ever_notice_how_many_diets_are_repackaged/,33,"People keep talking about how ""revolutionary"" Dr. Michael Greger is because he discovered this amazing new way of eating (i.e. diet), which will apparently help you live forever and prevent every disease known to mankind (I'm exaggerating here but you get the idea). The diet he recommends is almost the same as the Ornish diet, which existed in the 90's and makes the same exact claims. People later discovered that low fat diets are dangerous and that dietary fat doesn't even increase body fat, and yet still we have these new miracle diets that tell us that dietary fat is bad for us. And not only that, they're speaking as if this whole foods plant based diet is revolutionary. People have experienced long term damage from following low fat diets. 

Someone else on here pointed out that keto is just a repackaged Atkins. The difference is that keto is supposed to be a ""lifestyle"" and Atkins is supposed to be followed as a temporary diet. The reason why Atkins is supposed to be followed temporarily is that Dr. Atkins realized that sticking to such a plan long term is dangerous. So like...is keto just a more dangerous version of Atkins? I wish we could learn important lessons from the fad diets of the past instead of slapping new labels on them and sometimes even making them more dangerous. (ETA: I'm referring to keto as a weight loss diet; I'm not referring to the fact that keto is supposed to help those who are epileptic. Yes, keto has been used to help those who are epileptic, but it hasn't always been used as a popular weight loss diet.) 

And Soylent is the same thing as Slimfast, but I guess it's cooler and more scientific when dudebros do it. (ETA: The CEO of Soylent said that Soylent makes up 90% of his diet.) 

I think they do this because people will eventually realize that they don't know anyone whose life has greatly improved from the Ornish or Atkins diet, and so when they hear ""whole foods plant based"" or ""keto,"" they're more likely to ask: ""Hey what's this cool new diet pla--erm--lifestyle I haven't heard of before?"" 

I still can't wrap my head around the fact that shitty 90's nutrition has made its comeback. I thought we have all learned by now that dietary fat is important.",1579396081.0

Has anyone seen the new Abbey Sharp video? (+small rant about Abbey),12,epkt0x,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/epkt0x/has_anyone_seen_the_new_abbey_sharp_video_small/,8,"So a video of Abbey's was just recommended to me and so I then checked her page, and she posted a video titled ""I support you if you want to lose weight. Can you eat intuitively and want to lose weight?"" 

I didn't actually watch the video (and I'm not sure if I will), and so it could very well be clickbait. I just want to say that the very first principle of Intuitive Eating is ""reject the diet mentality,"" and there is no way to do this while pursuing weight loss. Again, I really don't know what she said in the video, but if she did say that you can eat intuitively and want to lose weight, I just want to say that that's not true. I'm honestly hesitant to actually watch the video, and so if someone who has seen the video or is willing to sit through it (it's twenty minutes long) could let me know what she said, that would be great. 

Abbey does have some great content on her channel, but my main problem with her is that she will roast the keto diet and then show keto recipes. She seems to pander to the mainstream diet crowd while she preaches about Intuitive Eating and rejecting diet culture. While this does annoy me, I do think that many people who wouldn't have known about this otherwise could learn about it from her. I actually found out about Intuitive Eating via a different YouTuber who claimed to be antidiet and made videos about Intuitive Eating while having other videos like ""Whole30 lunch ideas."" 

If Abbey doesn't actually believe what she says and is just pandering, she could always ignore people's requests. I just feel like people who are pseudo-antidiet and support pseudo-intuitive eating are making things more confusing. In order to be truly antidiet and truly eat intuitively, one must let go of the diet mentality (first principle) and challenge the food police (fourth principle). 

Again, this particular video may have been clickbait, but I do have some problems with her channel in general. That being said, I do genuinely love some of her content and I don't think that she is a bad person. I just wish that we wouldn't have all of this pseudo-antidiet and pseudo-intuitive eating stuff to make things more confusing. If the video was clickbait, just consider this a rant about people who claim to be pro-IE but don't even believe in the first principle of Intuitive Eating. 

I would think it's odd for someone who talks about how ""95% of diets fail"" to then go ahead and say that she supports intentional weight loss. ""Diet"" doesn't just mean short term diet or crash diet; it also includes ""lifestyle changes"" if those ""lifestyle changes"" are in pursuit of weight loss. 

Anyway, let me know what she said in the video if any of you actually sat through it.

ETA: Someone I was talking to just told me what it's about, and I disapprove of her message. The video wasn't clickbait. I'm disappointed in you, Abbey.",1579188539.0

They also attach a handout about the food pyramid, I’m assuming they don’t do this for regular BMIs. I feel like there is no one irl I have to talk to about this. My friends are very into diet culture (and are “healthy” weights).

I had an immediate urge to have a salad for lunch, not the kind I like but the restrictive diet kind I use to have with no cheese and lite dressing on the side. The only thing that is stopping me is I know that if I diet again it will inevitably fail and I will gain even more weight.

I don’t work out to lose weight, I do it to feel good, but I feel really guilty that sometimes I want to lose weight bc I know that isn’t healthy for me mentally. I break it down and realize that I don’t feel as strong as I used to (I can’t work out super hard cause of a brain injury) and that might be contributing to this feeling of “too much weight”, but I also know that I am really overweight and it doesn’t feel healthy. and then I’m like LOL DIET CULTURE HAS CONDITIONED ME TO FEEL THIS WAY.

Recovery win: No longer obsessing over food all day!,46,eokbfu,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/eokbfu/recovery_win_no_longer_obsessing_over_food_all_day/,14,"The road to intuitive eating and repairing my relationship with food has been long and hard, but today I had a realization: I no longer obsess over food all day long. Over time, food finally became something that is there to nourish me and give me energy, not something I’m always counting and thinking about and wishing I had. And it’s also there to bring me joy, like when my boyfriend takes me to a nice restaurant, or when I am able to stop at my favorite lunch place just because I want to. But food is just food. It’s there, it’s good, I eat it, sometimes I crave certain things, but I don’t think about it constantly or worry about it. And man, that is a level of freedom I hadn’t realized existed.

When I was in a disordered mindset, my days were planned around what I was going to eat when and how much, to the extent that I had every. single. meal. and snack prepped and portioned out, which completely eliminated my own choice or ability to listen to my body. But now I just eat when I’m hungry. And I actually realized that at times it almost gets annoying, like, “damn, I need to eat but that’s interrupting my day.” Disordered Me would have looked at the hunger cues as a different kind of inconvenience, a symbol of failure or diets not working. Now I just see it as something that takes up time I could be spending doing any one of the things I have since learned to devote my energy to now that my mind isn’t consumed by dieting 24/7. It’s a weird perspective to have now, feeling as though eating is just this thing I need to do to get through the day, rather than this huge, intense experience. I simply eat; sometimes it’s a great eating experience and sometimes it’s not, but either way, my body is nourished and taken care of. I go on with my day, not worried that I’m going to “use up” my calories too early or “fall off the wagon.”

"It occurred to me that there are SOME people who diet as a hobby more than anything, and not because they're interested in long term (or even short term) weight loss",14,eng620,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/eng620/it_occurred_to_me_that_there_are_some_people_who/,6,"I tried showing my brother *The Fuck It Diet* book recently, and he told me that he's ""really good at dieting"" and that he ""knows what he's doing."" He then went onto say that he's an expert at it because he's ""been dieting since 9th grade"" (he's 22 years old now). And I asked him if he has found anything that works for him, and he said something like ""I just like trying things like cutting out certain food groups to see how they affect me, and now I'm doing intermittent fasting."" I then asked him if he found anything that permanently keeps him within his ""goal weight,"" and he said that he ""just loses ten pounds when he feels like losing ten pounds,"" and that he doesn't care when regains those same ten pounds because he just tries something else to lose those ten pounds again. 

And what's funny about my brother is that he doesn't even look much different with or without those ten pounds. And while BMI isn't an accurate measure of health, his BMI is within ""average"" at both his higher and lower weights. And when he loses those ten pounds, I don't think that it makes much of a difference as to how others treat him. I think he just does it as a distracting hobby more than anything. And a few years ago he told me that he really wanted to do Keto (never ended up doing it), and now he's talking about how Dr. Michael Greger is going to save him. 

I remember (almost a year ago) I once mentioned something about how terrible the Paleo diet was for me, and this guy was like ""Yeah I used to be Paleo,"" and then he went on to list a whole bunch of other diets he had been on. He then went on to say that he has been ""average weight"" his entire life and that he only switches from Keto to Paleo to Whole Foods Plant Based to other diets ""for his health."" I then told him that I don't diet anymore and that I just do Intuitive Eating, and he asked me: ""What are the benefits to that? Studies show that people in these parts of the world live the longest because of what they eat. Will Intuitive Eating help you live long?"" I told him that I don't believe that it's healthy to constantly worry about longevity, and he said: ""Oh so you're saying live fast die young."" 

Anyway, it occurred to me that not all people who go on diets have the goal of losing weight (though these people are definitely in the minority); I think some people just use it as a distraction, although it's not a healthy distraction by any means. Of course dieting serves as a distraction for those who diet in order to achieve weight loss (either permanent or temporary) as well. 

I don't get it because dieting is not only unhealthy, but it's BORING. I think they're so used to it that they don't realize how boring it is to wake up with the same thoughts of restriction each morning. I remember when I was doing intermittent fasting, I thought that there had to be another way to live because my thoughts were becoming super redundant. 

I think that part of the reason why such people diet is that they believe that if they're not losing weight, they're gaining weight. My mom actually told me that people have to be super careful about what they eat so that they don't become 600 pounds. This is a myth that diet culture tells us. Like I feel like so many people believe that weight just doesn't...stabilize. The irony is that diets reduce our energy expenditure and those who diet are more likely to become heavier long term. Diet culture gets people who just fear gaining weight to go on diets, and that's how they create chronic dieters because those who go on diets are more likely to gain weight long term and suffer from health problems. 

Have any of you ever seen anything similar? People who are obsessed with dieting but not particularly interested in weight loss? Could be they have some underlying body dysmorphia but I wouldn't know for sure. 

I think that one of the sneaky things about diet culture is that it manages to hurt people who don't even want to lose weight or at least didn't start off wanting to lose weight, for it tells us to do Keto or Paleo or Atkins or Whole30 or Whole Foods Plant Based ""for our health."" From my personal experience (and from what we have seen in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment), food restriction can trigger body dysmorphia. And so I think many people probably start off wanting to ""get healthy"" and then the restriction eventually makes them want to lose weight, aside from the fact that restriction will likely make them gain even more weight long term.

Reading people complain about how they reached their goal weight but still didn't like their bodies, and being suggested body recomposition, or reading claims that BMIs over 20 are ""too high"" unless you're very muscular, made me feel like I would never be good enough, because I didn't have time for going to the gym 5-6 times a week. 

It also upsets me that so many people assume people who complain about their bodies are immune to body dysmorphia and eating disorders. I rarely see anyone say you're good enough the way you are, you don't need to change your body, you need to work on your self-esteem.",1578733416.0

I became carbphobic after discovering Paleo, but now I give myself unconditional permission to eat all the carbs I want.

Carbs and fat are a match made in heaven. My favorite carb+fat combos include: Avocado toast, dates with peanut butter, bagel with lox and cream cheese, cakes with cream cheese frosting, etc. I love carbs and fats.

Anyway, she starts off by saying, “I can’t wait to get back on my diet. I’m going to do ultra low carb AND intermittent fasting! I already told your father how miserable I’m going to be this week.” That last part sounded proud somehow...? 

I usually just change the subject or indicate how bored I am when diet talk comes up, but today I said, “Wow, what a fun, great way to live!” That gave me a small window to talk about how I was eating like a normal, healthy human being (read: literally just eating enough varied food to feel satisfied and focused) and it’s so hilarious how skeptical the response was.

When people would talk about how they plan on losing weight, I'd be like ""going Paleo has worked for me"" and ""cutting carbs has worked for me."" I would also randomly tell people about my diets without them bringing it up. Even if they themselves weren't believers in Paleo or intermittent fasting, none of them ever said to me: ""You're not a doctor."" People were always very nice and respectful when I would talk about my diets, and if they disagreed, they'd say something like ""I tried that and it hasn't worked for me.""

Now whenever I talk about the links between dieting and eating disorders and how diets aren't sustainable long term (which I try to avoid talking about, but sometimes people really piss me off), people feel the need to point out that I'm not a doctor. I never was a doctor, and yet you all listened to what I had to say when I gave dietary advice. Most people who talk about their diets aren't doctors. And what's funny is that the ""you're not a doctor"" people are never doctors themselves. They just know that there are doctors who agree with them, but there are doctors who agree with me and so what's their point?

This came to mind because my mom recently told me that I ""made a total fool out of myself"" when I told a nephrologist that he shouldn't preach about the benefits of fasting to everyone given that there's a link between fasting and eating disorders. But the thing is, even if he weren't a doctor and were preaching about the benefits of fasting to everyone, no one would tell him that he's not a doctor. And if I were a nephrologist who told a non-doctor that there are links between fasting and eating disorders, no one would be like ""Oh wow listen to her. She's a nephrologist.""

And my mom told me that my beliefs ""aren't based on real life observations"" and that I ""just believe things based off of what I read off of the Internet."" I was insulted, for I became anti-diet partially because diet logic was never compatible with my real life observations, and ""just believes in things one reads off the Internet"" describes most dieters. Before I went Paleo, my sister told me that Paleo is ""the only diet that really works,"" but is that based off of real life observations?

My mom told me that I'm stupid and naive for believing in this garbage, but back when I told her that soup cleanses are dumb (before I became anti-diet), she told me: ""Whatever works."" Has she ever seen soup cleanses working long term?

"They believe that reduced energy expenditure as a result of caloric restriction is a myth, and yet they go around saying that you can ""survive on very little food"" and believe that 1200 calorie diets are supposed to be followed long term.",23,eke64p,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/eke64p/they_believe_that_reduced_energy_expenditure_as_a/,16,"If reduced energy expenditure as a result of caloric restriction were a myth, then most of the diets they promote would be deadly. They're not deadly, and that's only because ""starvation mode"" (which is a term many people like to  misinterpret) is real.

According to a TDEE calculator, a sedentary 5'4 22 y/o woman who weighs 130 pounds would maintain her weight at 1,602 calories. If she cuts down to 1,200 calories, she would lose approximately 0.8 pounds a week. And since reduced energy expenditure as a result of caloric restriction is pseudoscience according to these people, such a person would continue losing 0.8 pounds each week, which would mean that she'd be dead before she reaches 80 weeks of following such a diet. I don't get it. It's not like they promote 1200 calories only as a short term diet (which would still be a problem), and so how does this match up with believing that reduced energy expenditure isn't real? Do they just want everyone to die? And have they ever seen anyone consistently lose the same amount of pounds each week for an extended period of time?  

They also believe that grown men should be on 1400-1500 calorie diets long term, but that would also be deadly according to their logic. If they believe that it's only supposed to be followed short term, no one ever keeps off weight from following a diet short term. So according to diet logic, if you don't want to die, you would gain everything back. But they claim that it's safe AND that you can keep the pounds away forever while simultaneously believing that your metabolism doesn't slow down. Weight loss diets aren't safe and sustainable long term, but if reduced energy expenditure as a result of caloric restriction were a myth, then they'd be even less safe and sustainable. 

They go around saying that you can survive on very little food, which is true but only because reduced energy expenditure happens. If it didn't happen, we would be dead.

Edit: I thought I made it clear in this post that I don't believe that someone would continue losing weight on a 1200 calorie diet. But if reduced energy expenditure as a result of caloric restriction were a myth (as dieters claim it to be), then this would be the case.

Started off at 180, down to 130 and my goal weight is 115."" If they genuinely just believed that it was just ""being overweight"" that's unhealthy and the goal is just to be ""within a healthy BMI,"" why do so many people who are already within that ""healthy BMI"" range want to lose more weight if it's not for aesthetic reasons? And why are those who are already ""average weight"" constantly encouraged to lose weight?

I do believe that diets are bad for people of all sizes, but they don't just believe that ""overweight"" or ""obese"" individuals ought to lose weight; they believe that intentional weight loss is good for everyone who isn't super thin. And then these same exact people claim that it's ""just about health."" Even if you do believe that the BMI is an accurate measure of health and that health can be measured by weight alone, what would be the point in going from an already ""healthy weight"" to a lower ""healthy weight"" if not for aesthetic purposes?

Back when I was in eighth grade and already ""average weight,"" no one ever discouraged me from losing weight. And this is back when I was thirteen. Even adults were encouraging. That's why I laugh when I see these fake Reddit posts about how their coworkers are discouraging them from losing weight and bullying them into ""loving themselves as they are.""

I used to have a coworker whose starting weight was extremely ""average,"" and one of my other coworkers was complimenting her on her weight loss progress.

Their ""concern"" for people in larger bodies has to do with aesthetics as well. I think if it were purely about ""health,"" they'd be like ""Oh these are my new blood sugar levels"" as opposed to ""These are my before and after weight loss progress pics.""

People who so happen to be intolerant to whatever the demonized food of the day is,59,eikno3,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/eikno3/people_who_so_happen_to_be_intolerant_to_whatever/,14,"Does anyone else know people like this? 

After she read *The Wheat Belly* book, my mom magically realized that eating gluten makes her ""feel bad."" For some reason, she assumed that spelt didn't have gluten and ate spelt all the time and guess what? She didn't ever complain about ""feeling bad"" even though spelt has gluten.  Of course there are people who can't eat gluten for a variety of reasons, but where were all these gluten intolerant people before the 2010's? And why is it usually people who are obsessed with weight loss who magically ""feel bad"" whenever they consume the demonized food category of the day? 

I rarely see people who aren't obsessed with weight loss claiming to have ""sensitive stomachs"" or whatever. Usually if those people can't eat something, it's because they have full blown allergies. I do believe that food sensitivities and intolerances are a thing, but I think that so much of it is just a placebo effect.

I think that some people probably can't eat x food in large amounts, and so they write it off completely because it gives them an excuse to restrict their food even more. I can't eat large amounts of soy or else I get a stomachache, but I'm fine if I consume some soy sauce or bread that has soybeans in it. 

Another reason why people may ""feel bad"" is due to HOW they are eating the food. If you consume three slices of pizza within five minutes, you're probably going to feel bad regardless of whether or not you're intolerant to gluten or dairy or whatever. Diet culture teaches us to restrict, and that causes us to binge on the ""bad"" foods. Bingeing on ""bad"" foods could lead a stomachache, which makes us believe that we are in fact intolerant to those ""bad"" foods. 

I have a really hard time believing people who claim to be ""sensitive"" to whatever it's trendy to be ""sensitive"" to at the time, especially considering I have been there myself. Once upon a time I told myself that grains make me ""feel bad,"" but it was a combination of guilt and the fact that restriction leads to bingeing. I now consume grains at most of my meals and guess what? I'm doing just fine. I don't ""feel good"" all the time, but I'm human and am not supposed to ""feel good"" all the time. We are all supposed to feel the full range of human emotions. 

This all seems more innocuous than it actually is, for I do think it's a major problem that people constantly attribute their ""feeling bad"" or ""feeling lazy"" to food alone. Like I have a co-worker who coincidentally happens to be ""sensitive"" to all of the foods that are trendy to avoid (and is obsessed with weight loss), and I once overheard her saying that if you ever feel bad, just cut out gluten and it will heal all your problems. I think that so many people aren't actually getting to the root of their problems because they think that avoiding certain foods will solve everything. Maybe they need more sleep. Maybe their life just feels empty. Maybe they actually need medical intervention. And maybe just maybe dieting is their problem, and not gluten or legumes or dairy. 

(Of course it's not okay to feed someone something against their will. Just thought I'd make that disclaimer. And I do think that there are people with genuine food intolerances, but I don't think that it's as common as we think it is.)",1577898647.0

Diet culture's obsession with longevity (+small rant about diet talk during the holidays),49,eh7vdg,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/eh7vdg/diet_cultures_obsession_with_longevity_small_rant/,18,"I was at my cousin's (mom's first cousin, and so my first cousin once removed) house for a Chanukah party, and he was talking about how he does a five day water fast each month (and he was trying to recommend it to everyone there). I really try not to talk about my anti-diet stance with others, but I was so annoyed that I felt the need to chime in with ""You know fasting has risks, right? And I really don't think fasting is safe for everyone."" I was then told (by my immediate family members) that I'm not allowed to argue with him because he's a doctor, but doctors aren't omniscient beings and there are doctors who are HAES-inclusive. They were trying to say that I'm like an anti-vaxxxer because there's a doctor our there who disagrees with me. Why don't they compare Keto people to anti-vaxxers since there are doctors who disagree with them? 

Anyway, all the diet talk went on and at one point someone mentioned something like ""Oh eating 3,000 calories a day is dangerous."" My brother then chimed in with ""Have you read Dr. Michael Gregor's work? I want to get his book on how not to die."" My cousin was like ""I have that book right here."" I then told my brother that a person's lifespan is dependent on many factors and that there's a lot more to health and longevity than the food we put in our body. He was like ""No. This is science. The man who wrote this is a doctor."" 

I always found diet culture's obsession with longevity to be a bit strange being that whenever I read articles about centenarians, they never said anything along the lines of ""This man was constantly worried about not dying and so he always left out the oil whenever he made hummus"" or ""This woman did 47 celery juice cleanses in her lifetime"" or ""This man never got out of ketosis"" or ""This woman did multiple water fasts in her lifetime."" From what I've read about centenarians, it seems like most of them have lived lives that were far closer to an Intuitive Eating/non-diet lifestyle. And another thing I have learned from these articles is that we don't really have control over every aspect of our health and we can't really decide how long we will live. There are so many people who live lives that are just as ""healthy"" as that of these centenarians, and yet they don't get to live as long due to factors beyond their control. 

Diet-obsessed individuals keep bringing up Japan and how the people there live the longest because of their diet and lifestyle. The irony is that the average caloric consumption in Japan is 2,800, which is considered ""too much"" according to most of these people. The average person there doesn't follow a Whole Foods Plant Based Diet either. Their diet also includes refined grains AND animal products AND soy, and very few weight loss diets contain all of those things. And the countries in which people eat an average of 1,500 calories a day are the countries with some of the lowest average life expectancies. If there's anything they can learn from Japan and centenarians, it's stop restricting food groups and that longevity is dependent on many factors. 

I don't think there's any way to say that a particular diet makes you ""live forever"" considering people who have stuck to any particular diet plan their whole life are extremely rare. And so much of this whole ""longevity"" thing seems to be rooted in correlation=causation. There are so many more factors that go into our health and longevity than the food we put in our bodies.",1577637034.0

I don’t do this for any dietary reasons. In college, I worked at a coffee shop for a few years and genuinely grew to prefer the taste of black coffee rather than adding cream and sugar. Little bit of a coffee snob 😉

So after my drink is ready I tell him I’m ready to go. He starts going off on this tangent. He says he’s just like me, drinks his coffee black too. And then, he begins to rant about calories in coffee drinks. “I love lattes but did you know there are like 600 calories in them? I was trying to stay really fit a few years ago and I just couldn’t afford to keep that in my diet. Black coffee is so much better!!!”

This is where I just had to change the conversation. I felt like I couldn’t really change topics how I usually would with this guy I barely know. Normally I would mention something about not really being into diet culture and not caring about the calories of ANY coffee drink. But it makes me so mad that even with a stranger diet culture still tries to seep its way in everywhere. 

It doesn’t matter if you drink your coffee black or add creamer, drink dry cappuccinos or mochas or caramel macchiatos, or even a straight up americano. It just doesn’t matter. Drink your damn coffee and keep your diet culture to yourself.",1576939095.0

The majority of people are sedentary or eat unhealthily, that doesn't bother me as much as the men and women who work long hours, workout frequently and only eat 1000 calories or less. I am going to be taking in a lot of new clients soon and I want to make sure I am never causing negative relationships with eating and fitness. Of course I do my best to help my clients create healthy and reasonable goals and never push things on people, but I want to know more about promoting a healthy mindset. How can I do this?

I came into my knowledge about HAES and intuitive eating through my MPH program, but I’m guessing a lot of my academic resources are going to be too dense. A lot of my other resources are RDs I follow on Instagram, and that’s not really my mom’s thing. Any books, websites, articles, etc appreciated! 

A little background: last night my mom said that she wants to lose 10lbs as her New Year’s Resolution. My mom is active and healthy, she exercises 5 days a week and eats a varied diet including a lot of vegetables her and my dad grow at home. I tried to talk to her about how restriction isn’t great for long term weight stability, diet culture, HAES, and how she could focus instead on other goals - for example, part of the 10lb thing is that her and my dad are taking a trip to Alaska where she’ll be hiking a lot, so my dad suggested that one of her non-weight loss goals could be that they do practice hikes nearby a certain number of times per month or something (my dad is a scientist and knows that I’m not just pulling stuff like this out of my ass, so he’s on board with my anti-diet stuff). Anyway, she just kind of shut me down and talked about how Weight Watchers helped her lose weight in the past (of course, she didn’t acknowledge that when she stopped restricting, she went back to where her body’s comfortable, but whatever). Anyway, my mom is awesome and a badass, and I want to at least try to help her shift her thinking to be more body positive and neutral around food, which she loves.

And I'm not saying she shouldn't care about her family's health, but it just makes me wonder what her priorities are when she's meal prepping these crazy ""healthy"" meals for herself and her family (including her 3 year old son). We were chatting the other day about food and dieting and I brought up  the TFID book and what I found compelling about it, and she agreed with listening to your body, honoring your hunger, and those kind of ideas, but then she did a complete 180 and starting talking how people nowadays eat so badly and aren't aware of what's in the processed foods they're consuming. 

I remember she mentioned once that she got annoyed at her mother for giving her son a peanut butter and fluff sandwich.

Do you think that science/psychology behind how and why we eat the way we do isn't popular because it goes into anti-diet territory?,65,e8376a,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/e8376a/do_you_think_that_sciencepsychology_behind_how/,25,"Or at least it seems unpopular to me. 

I remember years ago, there was an article in some magazine about formerly ""morbidly obese"" individuals and what they used to eat vs. what they eat now at their lower weights. The article showed that one of them used to eat an entire box of Trix cereal for breakfast each morning. 

I find it interesting that it's not super popular to ask WHY people become ""morbidly obese"" or WHY they eat an entire box of Trix cereal each morning. It's always ""oh people are fat because they eat too much."" And even if it were that simple, why isn't it popular to ask WHY certain people eat too much? 

Like maybe they're depressed or anxious, but the solution is always ""they should eat less."" In the mainstream, there's not much questioning regarding why different humans eat differently. It's always ""This way of eating=bad. This way of eating=good. If your eating habits are bad, then make sure they're good."" 

I think the reason why it's not super popular in the mainstream to question our eating habits is that it leads into anti-diet territory. I think that once we question why some people have disordered eating habits, we start to see the negative effects diet culture has on our eating habits. I think that saying that they ""just lack willpower"" is just another way to obscure the harms done by diet culture. I don't think that all disordered eating habits are the result of diet culture, but many are. And even if we were to ask why people eat the way they do even when it's not the result of diet culture, we would still realize that diets aren't the answer to their issues.

Edit: Since some people in the comments do not understand, I never said that it's not researched, for I'm fully aware that it is. I'm saying that it's not mainstream in the sense that it doesn't make headlines the same way ""sugar is bad for you"" typically does.

So the new peloton commercial, if you have missed the uproar, shows a wife receiving a brand new Peloton bike for Christmas. If you don't know, these bikes are extremely expensive and incredibly nice. She is excited about the gift, and documents using her phone to video herself on her first few rides, becomes proud to have done 6 days in a row, then the commercial closes with her showing her husband a homemade video compilation thanking him for the gift. 

The internet is in an uproar about this commercial to the point that Peloton's stock has gone down. I personally just don't see the point in all of the backlash? People are insinuating that her husband got her this ""for weight loss"" or some other offensive reason, but the video does not show her losing weight, commenting on her weight, etc. she legit just seems to love to work out?

As a child, I would just listen to what other people said about food and weight loss and just took their word for it. I would get super anxious all the time because people would often tell me that foods that I thought were ""healthy"" were actually bad for me. Olives? ""Fattening."" Almonds? ""Fattening."" Seemed like everything was bad. 

I didn't start actually reading about nutrition and looking into different diets until the age of nineteen, and that's when I started Paleo. I remember I once made these Paleo ""granola"" bars out of nuts and maple syrup, and my mom told me that was I made is ""so fattening,"" and I was thinking how behind the times she is that she actually believes that dietary fat turns into fat on your body. I had also been told that ""too much protein"" is bad for you, and so I was somewhat anxious about that as well. 

I remember that going Paleo initially did feel a lot ""freer"" than ""not dieting."" I was like ""Hey I could eat all this 'bad' stuff like coconut oil and tree nuts and all the protein I want, and I could still lose weight."" Of course donuts and pizza were off limits, but before Paleo, almost EVERYTHING seemed off limits. While it was not beneficial and actually did make me feel crazy around food in the long run, it still felt ""freer"" at the time than just listening to what other people told me. I had heard a lot of anti-carb and anti-fat (as in the macronutrient) sentiment before, and so it was so nice to not have to worry about my dietary fat intake for the first time in eleven years. 

I think that's part of the appeal of intermittent fasting as well. It's like ""Oh so I only have to worry about the time frame in which I eat and nothing else."" I know that that was one of the things that appealed to me about IF (main one being weight loss). 

I had been meaning to make this post for a while. I just thought about it now because a user here said that she felt super anxious while ""not dieting"" because she finds fault with every food, and those were my experiences as well. I think that most have to realize that ""not dieting"" while having mental restrictions is still dieting.

For example, if someone loses 50 pounds in 2014, gains that weight back in 2015, loses it again in 2016, gains it back in 2018 and loses it again in 2019, that person is often marked as a ""weight loss success story."" And my dad lost a lot of weight as a teenager but gained it back after eight years, and so prior to the weight returning, he would probably be marked as a ""weight loss success story"" as well. 

I remember after hearing ""diets don't work,"" I would often try to think of someone I know without a known eating disorder who has kept off weight for more than five years, and I could only think of one person. When I would tell my mom that long term weight loss is unattainable for most, she would list three people she knows who lost weight and kept it off (excluding those who have had gastric bypass surgery). I know that this is anecdotal, but I think it says a lot that I could only think of ONE PERSON who lost a significant amount of weight and kept it off (excluding those who wound up in the hospital). And back before I became antidiet, I wanted to believe in long term weight loss, but I couldn't based on my real life observations. 

I did have doubts about this whole ""diets don't work"" thing at first, but all I have to do is look at my surroundings. Those I know who are obsessed with diets and weight loss usually end up weighing more than they did beforehand. I have two siblings who try to ""educate"" me and tell me that what I believe is BS, while they themselves keep losing and gaining the same 10-15 pounds over and over again. 

I'm not going to go into WHY diets don't work right now, but my point is that diets ""working"" (as in long term weight loss) is a lot rarer than we think it is. And even when it does happen, it often leads to eating disorders and so there's no point.",1575580826.0

However, I do have some questions. To my basic understanding, intuitive eating essentially means 1: guilt-free eating, 2: listening to your body and feeding it what it needs. 

For me.. eating super-low-carb/keto makes me feel AMAZING. And 90% of the time, I would take a steak and broccoli over a steak and potatoes on a basic pleasure level. The more protein I eat, and the less carbs I eat, the more energy I have and the better I overall feel. Same with fasting - as long as I maintain a healthy level of nutrition in between fasts(aka giving my body what it needs and more importantly eating what I truly want to), occasional extended fasting is super helpful for my mental and physical health. 

So... Am I insane to think that ""intuitive eating"" and ""low-carb diet"" can work together?

Edit: for the record, weight loss has never been a goal. I just want to enjoy the food I eatand be physically and mentally healthy.

Being depressed is unhealthy too, but most would find it silly to tell someone who is depressed to ""just think happy thoughts"" or send them to a ""happy camp"" that would just make them even more depressed in the long run.

It's funny because no one accuses subreddits like r/thanksimcured of ""glorifying mental illness"" (and I sort of feel like they do in a sense tbh). If I spoke out against certain forms of treatment, no one would say ""Oh well being mentally ill is unhealthy,"" for they understand that criticizing certain forms of treatment doesn't make one ""pro mental illness"" or ""glorifying mental illness.""

I gave her the Intuitive Eating book to read towards the beginning of this year, and I remember when she was finished reading it she said: ""Oh wow. I've been way less preoccupied with my body and food now."" And I remember as she was reading it, she said: ""Oh wow this book truly describes the issues I have with food."" Then she started going back to talking about weight and calories again. I guess it's because IE isn't a weight loss strategy, and she has always valued thinness. 

Anyway, she's going Weight Watchers now, which upsets me, and I'm surprised she hadn't done Weight Watchers sooner. She would always talk about how amazing WW is, and whenever I would criticize it, she would say something like ""Don't ever say anything bad about Weight Watchers. They have helped so many people achieve their dreams."" I always wanted to ask her why she doesn't just go on WW if it's ""so amazing"" and she's unhappy about her weight, but I didn't want to give her any ideas. And now she's finally doing Weight Watchers. 

I remember her trying to lose weight since I was eight years old, and I'm 24 now. That's 16 years. She would constantly blame herself for her diets not working and would say things like ""I have a very slow metabolism"" and ""I wish I had self control,"" but what she doesn't realize is that it's not her fault; diets are dumb. 

She always had this attitude that anything that could help you lose weight=good, aside from maybe things like laxatives. I remember she once told me: ""The healthiest countries are the ones in which people eat the least.""

Other people irl:,15,dwoe9o,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/dwoe9o/other_people_irl/,10,"I have pretty effectively cut out body negativity in my social media feed, I follow a lot of bopo activists on Instagram and I report ads that promote fatphobia (as hate speech). But the problem is, it’s so effective, now, when I encounter diet culture being vomited out of the mouths of people I love, I am absolutely caught off guard. 

I’m planning on going into eating disorder research, it’s something I’m fairly vocal about. I am anti diet and antishame. I am very pro food... 

And yet l, sometimes/often,  in coversation with me, people will still bring up their diet, their calorie counting, their obsession with being smaller, and I don’t know how to handle it, especially when they won’t stop. Usually I just don’t really respond to the first comment or two, or I say something mild like: “everyone has to figure out what works for them and their body” 

But then, if they keep talking about it, I’ll say something like, “I don’t really believe in diets”, which, to me, is a very normal thing to say, but has really offended people in the past.  If asked, I try to explain the science as far as I understand it, restricting calories may lead to short term weight loss, but evolutionarily your body thinks you’re starving, and lowers its metabolic rate to handle your energy needs based on this adjusted caloric intake. If and when you return to eating the amount of calories you are most comfortable with, your body will now work harder to store that as fat because it has that past experience with starvation. Diets lead to weight gain, self control isn’t a real thing and motivation derived from self hate is harmful to every kind of health. Not everyone is genetically predisposed to develop an eating disorder, but diets are essentially making appropriation of the disordered eating mindset a goal. In fact The Goal. 

Not only is this a goal that is self defeating- it’s also categorically (in my mind) the wrong goal. 

How can I opt out of this conversation in real life? How can I leave room for other people to exist with opinions very different from mine, or state my opinion in a way that won’t make people feel alienated? I am perfectly willing to have the conversation, but a lot of people aren’t. They are happy to vomit their diet culture on me, but my anti diet culture is something so foreign that they find it offensive. 

Also, I’m often discounted because of my size. I’m too fat for half the people I have this conversation with, and too skinny for the other half, (In either case the implication seems to be: well of course you’re anti-diet, look at you). 

One very good friend of mine accused me of glamorizing fatness because I view -her talking about herself and her fat, as disgusting,- as problematic. She said I couldn’t possibly know, because I’m not fat. 


I’m lost here. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you navigate situation where someone tries to talk to you about their diet? How do you handle talking about diet culture and anti diet culture when most people see dieting as a natural and casual conversation topic?",1573810096.0
I love how every single diet out there is THE ONE that will lead to eternal youth and immortality,38,dwhin4,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/dwhin4/i_love_how_every_single_diet_out_there_is_the_one/,7,"They're always like ""If you cut this out of your diet or follow this diet, you will be in perfect health your whole life and won't die."" 

One question that always comes to my mind: Where do they even find these people who have been sticking to a particular diet their whole life? Before I went Paleo, my younger sister told me that Paleo ""is the only diet that really works,"" but how many people have been Paleo for more than five years? And while I am aware that plant based diets aren't necessarily done for weight loss, even people who have been following plant based diets for a significant portion of their life are relatively uncommon. 

And then every single diet is compared to the Standard American Diet. Why don't they compare a Whole Foods Plant Based Diet to someone who eats 80% Whole Foods Plant Based and 20% things that don't fit in with the diet? People who are weighing their food and wearing yoga pants and drinking green juice all the time might live longer than others due to socioeconomic status, and not because of their 10-day juice cleanses. Much of it is rooted in correlation=causation. And they often ask people to self report what they ate that day for these studies. 

I recently had my brother lecture me about how ""plant based diets can help prevent almost every single disease,"" and when I told him that a lot of these studies are rooted in correlation=causation, he started telling me about Dr. Michael Greger and how I can't argue with him because ""Dr. Michael Greger is a doctor."" I then told him that I've seen doctors who support Keto diets and there are also doctors like Linda Bacon, and so the fact that he's a doctor doesn't mean anything and that there's no diet that's proven to ""help prevent almost every single disease."" He then told me that this is a ""widely accepted fact.""

"Our culture glorifies overworking and not getting enough sleep, and yet it expects to be beautiful, thin and have perfect hair and skin",154,du4jdl,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/du4jdl/our_culture_glorifies_overworking_and_not_getting/,11,"\*expects us

I was just thinking about this because I had difficulty sleeping three nights in a row this week, and my face broke out a lot as a result. I was then thinking that I know and have known people who would straight up brag about how busy they are and how they only get three hours of sleep a night, and how being someone who gets 7-9 hours of sleep a night, isn't stressed all the time and is in tune with their body's natural hunger and fullness cues is generally seen as ""lazy."" (I am by no means judging people for getting little sleep, but it shouldn't be something that is glorified. Rather, it should be seen as something that is unfortunate.)

One of the people I used to know who would brag about getting only three hours of sleep was constantly trying to lose weight. She had done so many of these 30 day cleanses. And guess what? She never got any thinner.

While that is bad in and of itself, our culture placing so much emphasis on thinness and appearances in general on top of this makes it 10x worse. Stress and lack of sleep leads to acne and future weight gain, which leads to bullying and weight stigma, which leads to even more stress.

I remember I once didn't eat anything but soup at a meal because I was sick, and this woman (who is honestly a very nice person) said to me: ""Oh wow you have tremendous self control."" And I told her that I was just eating like that because I was sick. I had never actually done any ""soup cleanses"" before, but I have lost hair with other diets. And guess what? I would often gain back even more weight once I stopped the diet but still ""mostly stuck to the diet."" I can't imagine the hair loss and future weight gain from even more restrictive diets.

We are supposed to be constantly doing that which increases cortisol in our body and raises our bodies' natural set points, but at the same time we are supposed to have clear skin, beautiful hair and be thin. If you're sleep deprived and are constantly doing celery juice cleanses or whatever, it's unlikely that you will have all these things.",1573346950.0

I'm doing a research project about the problematic crash diet culture of the 1970s, particularly diets aimed at women (such as in Vogue). A viral tweet made last year recalled an egg and wine crash diet published in Vogue's 1977 Body and Beauty Book. A lot of the people in the replies, a majority which were women, shared their mother's or their own experience with that specific diet and other Vogue published ones (a diet of just milk and bananas!). Did lots of people follow these? I have my own experience with crazy modern-day diets (think detox tea lol), and lots of women in my family have experience with loads of these kinds of diets, but I'm curious to know just how many people believed they would work. Or were they dismissed as they are today? I'm having trouble finding some **primary sources** of people's experience w/ these sorts of diets and even contemporary critiques made when they were published. Did anyone record their weight loss with these fad diets in the 70s? I'd love to hear anyone's stories.

Where the fuck has all this been all my life?,44,dqw3u1,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/dqw3u1/where_the_fuck_has_all_this_been_all_my_life/,8,"Whew, this might end up being a bit of a long one but I feel like I want to get this OUT. I’m 35 now and have been on the restrict/binge hamster wheel for over 20 years. 
Growing up, I remember my mom eating like, half a plain baked potato for dinner. (Omg weird 90s diets!) She worked really hard to never mention weight to me or discuss diets, and I appreciate that, but actions speak louder than words. She was a classic yo-yo dieter my whole childhood.
Puberty hit me early though and I got awkwardly large. I just became suddenly really giant, in height and width. I remember being about 11 the first time a girl on my baseball team called me “fatty”. At the time I didn’t really know what it meant. 
Shortly thereafter, I started rowing in a really competitive program and the pudge disappeared without me really noticing it. When I was 13/14 I was just slightly over the threshold to compete in a lightweight category, so my coach encouraged me to lose a couple pounds. “Just cut back on carbs - pasta and rice.” Little did I know I was kicking off two decades of food obsession and body image hell. 
I’ve really never been overweight at all, like within 10lbs of my ideal weight. But I’ve probably gained and lost that same 10lbs at least 100 times. I’ve done every diet out there - Atkins, South Beach, Whole30, Paleo, low-carb, CICO, keto. I’m a hardcore perfectionist and couldn’t understand why this ONE THING in my life was seemingly defeating me. I felt betrayed by my own body, that I couldn’t muster the will power to stick to these insane regimes. Usually some massive “success” the first round, and then never really able to recreate it - diminishing returns.
A few months ago, I felt like I’d really arrived at a crossroads. Despite “success” with low carb and whole 30 diets in the past, I just felt like I couldn’t even get started. Every Monday was a “clean slate” and by Friday I was chorfing down a family-sized bag of Doritos. I was in a spiral of self-hatred. I was either gonna dive head first into incredibly disordered eating, or blow up to 400lbs (this was how I felt). 
Let me just pause to say here that this has sucked up so very much of my precious life. There is not ONE HOUR of one day of the last 20 years when I didn’t have some thought in my head like “My pants are tight, ugh” “can’t believe I just ate that.” “Gonna have to run 10km to make up for this” “ugh I feel fat” “I bet they think I’m fat” BLAH BLAH BLAH. For the first time, I feel a bit angry about this. I feel cheated, ripped off. This has cost me so, so dearly. 
Instead of going down the orthorexia road though, I tripped on Kara Lowentheil’s amazing “Unfuck your Brain” podcast. She talks about all kinds of stuff that really resonates for me, but what I was super fascinated by was that this girl in a large body really fucking loves herself. Like no holds barred. She BELIEVES. And it was kind of a weird thing for me to realize, that if someone really believes they are beautiful, like feels it in their soul, then it absolutely does not matter what anyone else thinks. It doesn’t. I’ve seen this type of stuff on motivational posters but never really understood it on this level. All this time, my worry about what others think was just this kind of externalization of my own self-hatred. I started just kind of googling and reading and tripped on other podcasts and anti-diet writing and for all of it I’m just like YES YES YES YES!!!! 
Of course I need to trust my body. Of course my body knows what it wants and I can stop being a psycho control freak with my one and only meat suit for this life. I have two daughters and I am desperate - DESPERATE - to not pass on this kind of psychotic, all-consuming, crippling bullshit.

Do you think the anti-diet movement/IE would be taken more seriously if there were more men involved?,44,dm1190,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/dm1190/do_you_think_the_antidiet_movementie_would_be/,10,"I'm aware that there are a lot of men who have researched obesity and weight loss and have come to the conclusion that diets don't work, but most people who seem to be at the forefront of the anti-diet movement seem to be women.

When grown men go on 40 day water fasts, it's water fasting. 

While I do not think that that the anti-diet movement will become mainstream anytime soon, I do think much of the reason as to why it's considered ""a pseudoscientific SJW movement"" is largely due to the fact that there aren't as many outspoken antidiet males out there, and they like portray women as ""anti-science."" 

I'm not asking that men get involved in the anti-diet movement, but since diets are portrayed as ""dumb"" and ""vain"" when girls and women do them and as ""scientific"" when grown men do them, I think this more or less applies to the anti-diet movement.

Concerned about lack of hunger,17,d1rq41,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/d1rq41/concerned_about_lack_of_hunger/,10,"My start on the anti-diet (F* it diet) journey was probably similar to others, but I'm worried that the point where I shared my goals with my husband derailed me in a way I can't see. It's also possibly caused by my monthly cycle beginning and ending. For context, I'm very new to this, having started at the end of August, then migrating to the F* it diet last week. Last week I ate nearly non-stop, this week I have no appetite at all.

I started reading the Intuitive Eating book, but half-way through could feel my diet-focused beliefs trying to adapt to the process. The first few days of intuitive eating, I still focused too much on kCal, choosing certain foods over others even if I really wanted chocolate and not bananas. 

Concerned I was mis-interpreting Intuitive Eating, I came to reddit and found book recommendations for the F* it diet and the one by Linda Bacon. I started listening to the F* it diet (someone on Reddit specifically recommended it over Intuitive Eating), and it clicked almost immediately. I deleted ""Those Apps"" on my phone and literally ate whatever I wanted. It felt very different from what I'd been trying to do with IE.

Shortly after ""letting go,"" my monthly cycle started, and I believe the combination made me nearly-constantly hungry. I ate to uncomfortable fullness, was eating almost the entire day, and I went to bed still full and completely satisfied. Stranger still, I woke up with a grumbling stomach every morning, to the point I'd pick up a snack in the work kitchen in addition to eating breakfast at a cafe (they don't open for an hour after I get to work).

Over this past weekend, I mentioned the F* it diet to my husband. He was surprised the goal wasn't to lose weight, and that in the first phase (which could take almost a year) I might gain weight. He expressed his concern in relation to my health, to which I explained my weight wasn't directly related to my health, and that reducing my stress was way more important. He loves me at any weight -- that's not why he voiced concerns. We were just recently told by my doctor that my health problems would go away if I'd lose some weight. Despite trying desperately to lose weight for the past decade, I sincerely hoped something would click with this ""health scare"" (which really isn't a big deal, I don't have diabetes or high cholesterol, and my blood pressure is only a ""little high""). The first month after the ""health scare"" I doubled down, which resulted in huge binges and the first fears that maybe I was addicted to food. It was through food addiction research that I found IE, which led to these other books.

Ever since my husband and I had that 5 minute conversation, my appetite has been what I'd term ""hard to find."" I don't feel the same voracious appetite yelling at me to eat. Yesterday, I had 0 desire eat breakfast, and it wasn't until lunch that I started feeling a few hunger pangs. Even then, I couldn't finish a bag of chips, and at dinner I only ate half of my plate of food.

While my monthly cycle did end over the weekend, which could be part of why I'm not as hungry as I was last week, I'm worried that talk did something in my head. The milkshake story in the F* it diet reflected how ghrelin levels are majorly affected by what you're thinking. If this is a head problem, will it undermine my journey? Many people here have explained ""You'll know if you're restricting if you find yourself bingeing,"" which I will certainly pay attention to. I just don't know how to *stop* feeling ""not hungry.""

From the full paper: 

 

>Obesity is among the most significant health problems facing the United States, and levels of obesity are increasing throughout the world. One-third of U.S. adults are estimated to be obese ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R1)), and obesity is beginning to replace malnutrition and infectious diseases as the most significant contributor to poor health worldwide ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R2)). In light of these trends, much research is being conducted on intentional weight loss and weight maintenance. Although intentional weight loss efforts may be effective in the short-term, these losses are often not maintained over the long-term, and it is essential that researchers identify the mechanisms that lead to weight regain after intentional weight loss to inform interventions that can reverse, circumvent, or alter them.  
>  
>One of the most common methods of intentional weight loss is the restriction of caloric intake, commonly known as dieting ([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R3)). Nationally representative numbers from 2005 indicate that approximately 47% of adults in the United States are trying to lose weight at any given time ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R4)). Despite the high prevalence of dieting, research finds that dieting leads to successful weight loss in the short-term but not the long-term ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R6)). A recent review article found that 30–64% of diet study participants gain back *more* weight than they lost on the diet ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R5)). Further, having dieted in the past was a predictor of weight gain, and the longer participants were followed up, the more weight they had regained ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R5)).[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#FN2)  
>  
>To fully understand the mechanisms of diet failure, it is necessary to consider the biological and psychological processes that occur when individuals go on diets. We began with the broad hypothesis that diets fail because they increase stress. In this study, we specifically tested the latter half of this hypothesis, namely that dieting causes increases in indicators of stress. Stress is defined as a negative emotional experience that is accompanied by predictable biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes ([11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R11)), and it is a prime suspect as a potential cause of weight regain after dieting. First, stress can increase weight through the stress-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) pathway that affects energy metabolism – the focus of the current study. HPA-mediated weight gain has been studied extensively ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R12)). Research suggests strong connections between stress and weight gain through elevations of cortisol regulated by the prolonged activation of the HPA axis and resulting insulin resistance ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R12)–[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R16)).

>Dieting is likely psychologically stressful. As dieting, by definition, is an act of restriction of eating, this deprivation elicits negative emotion. Dieting involves not merely resisting temptation, but also a physically aversive feeling of being hungry. Reviews of dieting studies have documented negative emotional consequences of dieting such as depression, anxiety, decreased self-esteem, nervousness, and irritability ([17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R17)).  
>  
>In addition to restricting one’s intake, there is another main task in dieting: monitoring one’s caloric intake. Research indicates that frequent, repetitive hassles can accumulate over time to comprise a chronic stressor ([18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R18)) that has negative health consequences. Monitoring food and calorie intake during a diet may be one of these daily hassles. Consistent with this point, in the original sample used in the development of the Hassles Scale, “concerns about weight” were among the five most frequently cited hassles ([18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R18)).  
>  
>The relationship between dieting and both perceived stress and cortisol has been investigated in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. For example, in a study of 17,159 adolescent females, French and colleagues found that dieting five or more times in the past year was correlated with emotional stress in Whites, Blacks, and Asians ([17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R17)). Researchers have long known that fasting and starvation are associated with an elevation of cortisol or failure to suppress cortisol after a dexamethasone suppression test ([19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R19)–[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R21)). In addition, studies have found that higher dietary restraint (a measure of dieting[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#FN3)) is associated with higher 24-hour urinary free cortisol concentrations, and cortisol-creatinine ratios, salivary cortisol, and cortisol awakening response ([22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R22)–[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R24)). To date, however, no study has used an experimental design to test the causal effects of dieting on stress in humans.  
>  
>The present research tested the following two hypotheses: ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R1)) The monitoring aspect of dieting causes increases in psychological stress and cortisol; and ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R2)) The restricting aspect of dieting causes increases in psychological stress and cortisol. These hypotheses were tested using a fully-crossed, randomized, controlled experiment with monitoring and restricting as two factors.

>The results of this study have a number of important implications. Regardless of diet success or failure, if dieting is shown in future studies to reliably increase stress and cortisol, clinicians may need to rethink recommending dieting to their patients to improve health. Chronic stress, in addition to promoting weight gain, has been linked with a host of negative health outcomes such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and impaired immune functioning ([43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/#R43)). To the extent that dieting might potentially add to this stress burden, its psychological and biological consequences would best not be ignored.",1566747656.0

When we accept ourselves today, as we are right now in this moment, we actually get the feelings that we wanted but could never obtain by losing weight (or whatever). And when self acceptance comes without conditions, the goal posts can't be moved.

I did away with calorie control and restriction diets 6 years ago now, and I'm at a great place with eating. I used to be a disordered eater though, so I still have thoughts like that running through my head at times.

The most triggering thing is the onslaught of comments from dieters, or pretty much everyone, who believes one should eat the smallest amount possible. 

There is a thin woman at my work who barely eats at all. Lunch is usually a nonfat container of yogurt, OR some crackers and that's it. That's her business, but her constant comments about calories and weight get to me.

I'm naturally thin, so she's always expressing incredulity at the amount of food I eat (and I don't agree it's a lot... it's just not starvation).

For example, I was walking by her today with my stack of containers for lunch today, and she said ""Wow!!! That's a lot of food!!! But maybe you aren't eating all of it!""

I said ""No, I definitely will."" And kept walking. And she yelled ""Well, you can afford it!!"" after me..

This just bothered me and I didn't enjoy my lunch like I would have. I'd like to get to a place where things like that don't bother me, but I doubt I'll get there. I know what I was eating wasn't a lot (not that I shouldn't eat a lot if I wanted to), but her comment made me question my perception.

""Science"" is thrown around loosely. Correlational studies. Studies in weird settings for 4 weeks that don't replicate anything like what real eating looks like for people.   


Plus, the science used to say dietary fat was the root of all evil. In the 80's, the science said low-fat was the solution that would magically make everyone healthy. Now science says ""jk it was sugar all along! or processed foods! or carbs! idk science is trying it's best over here right now"". We don't know what science will say in another 10, 20, 30 years from now, we don't know what we are wrong about yet.  


What we do know is that 95% of diets fail, and that weight loss sustained long term is as low at 1-3% at 5 years. We also know that weight-cycling leads to a number of health issues. Not to mention the mental health effects for people that come from restricting your intake and being hyper-critical of your body(internalized weight stigma). Plus despite diet/wellness culture has gotten more and more ubiquitous, the ""obesity"" rate has only gone up. If ANY of these diets ""worked"" long term, then you'd imagine the trend would be downwards.

One study here might say intermittent fasting is the solution. Another just plain fasting. Low glycemic index diets. Keto. Low carb. Whole foods. Science has been wrong about nutrition before, it will be wrong again.  


Your body is smart, if you restrict it, it will eat more to protect you from what it interprets as famine. If you trust your body, it will eventually trust you to feed it and you're life won't be controlled by food. It will just be another one of life's pleasures, as it should be :)",1564501605.0

He then compared the Paleo and Mediterranean diets to kosher and halal diets in the sense that they stood the test of time, which makes no sense to me considering kosher and halal are not weight loss diets and you can eat all the carbs you want if you keep kosher or halal.  He didn't say that he recommends Paleo or Mediterranean, but what he recommends you eat sounds an awful lot like the Paleo diet. 

His logic was ""it's extremely hard to overeat foods like leafy greens and grilled chicken."" And yeah, I had thought that Paleo made sense for this reason, but I realized during my IE journey that if you're truly in tune with your body's natural hunger and fullness cues, overeating (which in this case means eating past comfortable fullness) donuts or pasta becomes equally difficult. I think the main reason why it's difficult to overeat leafy greens and grilled chicken is that you're more likely to want donuts if you've been starving yourself, and so of course you're gonna eat more of them. 

I had done the Paleo diet, and guess what? It has all the flaws he attributes to the CICO diet.

Fasting Increases Risk for Onset of Binge Eating and Bulimic Pathology: A 5-Year Prospective Study,38,cbqevy,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/cbqevy/fasting_increases_risk_for_onset_of_binge_eating/,13,"Full paper here: 

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/) 

&#x200B;

 From the full paper: 

>Although adolescent girls with elevated dietary restraint scores are at increased risk for future binge eating and bulimic pathology, they do not eat less than those with lower restraint scores. The fact that only a small proportion of individuals with elevated dietary restraint scores develop bulimic pathology suggests that some extreme but rare form of dietary restriction may increase risk for this disturbance. We tested the hypothesis that fasting (going without eating for 24-hours for weight control) would be a more potent predictor of binge eating and bulimic pathology onset than dietary restraint scores using data from 496 adolescent girls followed over 5-years. Results confirmed that only 23% of participants with elevated dietary restraint scores reporting fasting. Furthermore, fasting generally showed stronger and more consistent predictive relations to future onset of recurrent binge eating and threshold/subthreshold bulimia nervosa over 1- to 5-year follow-up relative to dietary restraint, though the former effects were only significantly stronger than the latter for some comparisons. Results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that fasting is a stronger risk factor for bulimic pathology than is self-reported dieting.

And: 

 

>Experiments indicate that rodents assigned to extreme caloric deprivation conditions (in which they loose 5–20% of their weight) consumed significantly more calories *ad lib* immediately after deprivation than non-deprived rodents, but that shorter caloric restriction periods do not result in elevated caloric intake ([Borer, Rowland, Mirow, Borer, & Kelch, 1980](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/#R2); [Hagan, Chandler, Wauford, Rybak, & Oswald, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/#R9)). These findings imply that fasting (complete abstinence from caloric intake for 24 hours or more for weight control purposes), rather than more moderate dietary restriction, may increase risk for binge eating and bulimic pathology. It is vital to determine which forms of dietary restriction increase risk for bulimic pathology, so that public health professionals could provide more accurate advice regarding which behaviors may increase risk for bulimic pathology. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that fasting is a more potent predictor of future binge eating and bulimic pathology onset than elevated scores on a widely used dietary restraint scale.

And: 

 

>Experiments have found that acute periods of marked caloric restriction increase the reinforcing value of food ([Epstein, Truesdale, Wojcik, Paluch, & Raynor, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/#R6)), which may explain why fasting increases the risk for binge eating. Acute periods of marked caloric restriction have also been shown to deplete tryptophan, an amino acid precursor of serotonin ([Cowen, Clifford, Walsh, Williams, & Fairburn, 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/#R5)), which may increase the likelihood of binge eating high-carbohydrate food to restore tryptophan levels. Findings also converge with evidence that retrospectively reported weight suppression increases risk for the persistence of bulimia nervosa among those in treatment for this eating disorder ([Butryn, Lowe, Safter, & Agras, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850570/#R4)). However, these interpretations are based on the assumption that during fasting episodes participants consume fewer calories than people not engaging in fasting, which has not been confirmed with objective data.

And: 

 

>In conclusion, the present results suggest that fasting for weight control purposes is a more potent and consistent predictor of risk for future onset of binge eating and bulimic pathology, rather than less severe dieting behaviors practiced by individuals with elevated scores on dietary restraint scales. An important direction for future research will be to conduct rigorously controlled experiments that reduce fasting among at-risk samples to determine whether this reduces risk for current and future onset of binge eating and bulimic symptoms. Such experiments are vital because they are much less vulnerable to third-variable alternative explanations than prospective etiologic studies.",1562814081.0

I felt pretty amazing and even ask my boyfriend to bring me a bigger size (a size that had freaked me out before, because of thinking I'm fat if I have to wear that size) and I accepted it if something doesn't looked good.

The fact that people promote plant based diets for weight loss and ""health"" reasons (as opposed to environmental and ethical reasons), along with the fact that there's been a rise in low carb/no carb diets over the past few years, had really made me skeptical of diet culture as a whole. While becoming anti-diet didn't happen overnight for me, all of this contradictory information made becoming anti-diet seem a lot safer. To be honest, I'd probably be a lot more intimidated by carbs if foods like quinoa and oatmeal were never considered ""healthy."" 

I remember I would get mad whenever people would say that animal foods cause weight gain, considering I had previously lost weight on Paleo. But now plant foods also cause weight gain, y'know? And vegetables have oxalates and so you should be scared.

I want to ditch diet mentality once and for all, but it’s ingrained within me.",16,bql7v9,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/bql7v9/im_still_addicted_to_dieting_i_want_to_ditch_diet/,12,"Hey guys. I started my body positivity journey just before Christmas 2018. I was on a water fast at the time and stumbled across some bopo instagramers and after a day or so, made the decision to quit dieting for good.

Or at least I thought I had. I preach body positivity and anti-diet culture to pretty much everyone. I’ve learnt so much on my journey so far, and I have no issue in lecturing people on issues surrounding the current beauty standard and the scam that is diet culture. I *genuinely believe* in all I have learnt. The thing is, I still cannot fully apply it to myself. I’ve gained weight since Christmas. I look in the mirror, and I try to convince myself my body is beautiful the way it is and I do not need to go back to dieting, and even though I do sometimes see the beauty in myself now, I can’t deny that I will be happier dieting and skinnier. 

Firstly, dieting offers me a sense of control and progress. In the past, when everything else in life was chaotic and going wrong, I could at least be proud of the fact that I was sticking to a diet. I could at least *visibly see* the progress in my weight loss, and it gave me a sense of achievement. Even if losing weight was not my primary goal, I could at least be proud of the fact that I committed to something, and that at least one thing in my life was going as it should.

Secondly, I still genuinely believe I would be happier if I was skinnier. The first time I lost a large amount of weight was a few years ago, and honestly, I was so so happy. I know people say losing weight will not make you love yourself, but that honestly wasn’t the case for me. I felt so confident and in love with what I looked like, and with that, I felt the freedom to wear what I want and do what I want. My family and friends actually disapproved of my weight loss, and told me that I looked better when I was bigger, but honestly, I *didn’t care*. I looked in the mirror and felt hot af, and that was something I had never felt before. 

Naturally, I wasn’t able to maintain my excessive weight loss, and gained in all back. I’ve pretty much been switching between dieting and binging, up until Christmas, and maintained a curvy body. I know these bad eating habits have done a lot of damage to my body, which is why bopo/antidiet has been such a good thing for me. But honestly, right now I do not feel fully confident and hot. I am not at the point where I can walk outside with a skirt/shorts and not feel really self conscious. And what scares me is, I really don’t know when I’ll get there. It could be tomorrow, it could be 10 years from now. Am I willing to wait? Not really. I know if I were to lose weight over the course of a couple months, I would become instantly happier. And quite frankly I want that instant happiness. I don’t want to wait 10 years to feel confident in shorts or a swimsuit. I am young, and I want to feel confident while I am young.

I know that the only reason I feel happier when I’m skinnier is because of the societal beauty standard constantly advertised to us. I *know* that this beauty standard is false and that all bodies are beautiful. But my point is, although I believe this for everyone else, I do not believe it for *myself* yet. And I don’t know when I will. Which is why I’m not really willing to wait.

So that’s my dilemma. I want to continue with my bopo journey. It has done me so so much good. I love being able to eat whatever food when I want - something I haven’t allowed myself to do in years. And despite what I’ve said so far, this is the best I’ve ever felt about my larger body. But at the same time, I know I could be happier if i were skinnier. I can try and convince myself I’m happy the way things currently are, but I’d be lying. And I think it’s foolish to try and lie to myself. So right now, I’m sat on my bed, absolutely starving because I haven’t eaten all day. I really want to get rid of my diet addiction once and for all, but I just don’t know how. I feel stuck. I would really appreciate any advice 💕




TL;DR: Have been ‘body positive’ for several months now, but I know I will be happier and more confident if I were to go back to dieting. I’m sick and tired of feeling self conscious about my current body. I’m not willing to wait for confidence to arrive some day via my body positive journey. I want it now.",1558295538.0
"When people say 80% of weight loss is diet, I get so discouraged and take it to heart.",19,bqjner,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/bqjner/when_people_say_80_of_weight_loss_is_diet_i_get/,6,"I know this is the r/antidiet and that I should let go of the desire to lose weight but please hear me out: I’m stuck in two worlds: one where I want to love and accept my body and the other where I want to lose weight and go back to my “normal” body. You see, I have lupus and I have to take prednisone on and off for it. And prednisone causes you to gain weight. I have no choice too because it affects my kidneys (lupus nephritis) so I don’t know if my doctor would approve me of doing keto (I’m pretty desperate).

Anyway, I do enjoy working out for my mental and physical health. I mostly do barre classes and my first month of signing up, I was slimming down and toning up. But after a month I had to go back on prednisone because my kidney was acting up.

After a bad flare, my doctors decided to put me on Cytoxan (a form of IV infusion) to help with my kidney and taper off the prednisone. In the meantime, I still work out. My diet is not the best but my husband and I are working on it even though not too seriously. It’s just so discouraging when I read about fitness advice and everyone says “you can’t outrun a bad diet” “exercise is useless for weight loss” “80-90% of losing weight is diet”. 

Then it makes me feel like I need to stop working out (especially because I feel like the barre classes are making my legs a little bulky) and starve myself. I know it’s disordered thinking but I’ve had body image issues in the past even before having to take prednisone. I remember being in Hawaii with my family and instead of fully enjoying I was making every activity a workout and stressing out about eating. (This was when I was 17, I’m turning 30 soon). Or when we went to Vancouver to visit my family and I was buying fruits and yogurt and the grocery for breakfast (we’re Filipino, food is a HUGE part of our culture and my aunt is a great cook) and ordering salads at the restaurants. My aunt was expressing to my dad about how worried she was about me not eating enough.

Not just that, I feel pressured to do IF and OMAD and I just physically can’t because I get very dizzy and lightheaded to where it affects my work performance (I have good/great performance reviews but I have a super hard time concentrating). And then I have a crash and I worry and get anxious about getting a seizure (I’ve had seizures from lupus in the past).

It just makes me sad and discouraged and I end up binging (especially from the stress of having lupus and being on prednisone)

Sorry I just needed to vent about this. Since I know this is an antidiet sub, I’m not looking for weight loss advice (even though I know deep down I still want that). I’m just wondering if anyone feels the same way as I do about feeling like you have to starve yourself especially when people say that stuff about how diet is wayyy more important than working out.",1558287534.0

DETAILED TRUTHS BEHIND THE KETOGENIC DIET,13,bpu7pg,antidiet,https://www.thereallife-rd.com/2018/03/ketogenic-diet/,1,,1558114444.0
XXfitness and eating disorders,33,bontp6,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/bontp6/xxfitness_and_eating_disorders/,6,"I wanted to get other people's thoughts on this. I still occasionally read r/xxfitness which, while very diet culture-y in a lot of it's views, is a generally very accepting and positive place.  


It's breaking my heart though, reading through and seeing so so SO many participants talk about having histories of disordered eating and previous ED diagnosis's who are talking about their weight loss/gain and diets. Fitness, movement, etc can all be wonderful parts of life even for those who have previously struggled with EDs, however, the dieting and restricting are concerning.  


Dieting is harmful to some degree to most people, hence why we are here at r/antidiet. But for people with histories of ED's, dieting is extremely risky and 100% ill advised. If you have the history of an ED, you should never be putting yourself at risk of relapse by going on a restrictive diet unless there are some extraneous circumstances I'm not thinking of. God, if you have an ED history, you are in a group of people who could be most harmed by restricting your intake.  


And yet, over and over, I see folx in the xxfitness subreddit talking about their disordered eating in the past, then saying they eat xxxx calories a day now, logged in myfitnesspal and they have lost xx lbs. My heart goes out to these sufferers, since they are wrapped up in diet/fitness culture to the point where they don't see the very obvious idea that if you have had an ED, *you really shouldn't be dieting*.   


But diet culture says ""There are no exceptions, we should all be eating as little as possible, working out as much as possible, trying to maintain bodies that fit our ideals"" so even people with histories of ED's get the message that ""Oh good, you've recovered enough, now mess with your intake and your workouts so you can fit body standards better""   


Every time I see a poster there who used to have an ED or currently has an ED, I just want to say ""You are allowed to not diet, you are allowed to eat what you need, you are allowed to not work out"" and ""dieting is most likely worse for your health than not dieting""  


Obviously I respect everyone's choices and they know what is best for their recovery, but diet culture taints our judgement and 99% of people aren't critical of diet culture's messages. I am in ED recovery and I do strength training, however, I took several months off to repair my relationship with exercise and rest and make sure it is joyful movement, not societal obligation. Also, I've had 5 total ED relapses in the last 7 years, and a lot of those were caused by casually ""healthily"" dieting and trying to get more into fitness. I know better now, there is no such thing as healthily dieting for me. And I'd bet money that is true for a large portion of ED sufferers.",1557864348.0

I once had someone tell me that Ivanka Trump didn't have plastic surgery and that her face changed just because ""she lost weight.""

She's exploitative in other ways, but I won't go into them now since they're unrelated to diet culture.

Whenever I tell people about my stance on dieting, it's always something like: ""Well you've obviously never struggled with binge eating before. Some of us need to diet and exercise willpower."" I told them that it's not a question of ""willpower,"" for restriction is exactly what leads to bingeing. I don't need to exercise ""willpower"" to avoid bingeing at this point in my life. Letting go of restrictions and judgments around food is what helped me stop bingeing, and now the thought of bingeing stresses me out. 

It's like these people think that there's no such thing as a non-judgmental, healthy relationship with food. They're so stuck in the diet mentality that they don't think that there's any way of eating other than dieting or bingeing. Some of them seem to think that a healthy relationship with food doesn't exist for them, but others seem to think that such a thing doesn't exist at all. 

I feel like people who say things like ""I'm gonna eat an entire box of donuts if I stop dieting"" are probably in severe caloric deficit, for even during my diet days, I never felt like I could eat an entire box of donuts. I think that if you feel like you could eat an entire box of donuts, you're probably a lot hungrier than you should be. If you were honoring your body's natural hunger and satiety cues, you probably wouldn't feel like you could eat an entire box of donuts. (I think this should be obvious.)  

Dieting and bingeing are two sides of the same coin, and it's usually restriction that triggers bingeing. Even mental restriction alone triggers bingeing. My mom was convinced that she's an insatiable monster who needs to restrict because she can't stop eating, but then I gave her the Intuitive Eating book to read and she said that she doesn't binge anymore now that she applies Intuitive Eating to her life. For some people this may take longer (and some may need professional help), but it's so sad how people think that dieting and bingeing are the only options.

I fell out of the habit due to trying to avoid ""empty calories"" etc in bread. It's gotten to the point where I could probably count the number of times I've eaten bread in the last year on my fingers (of one hand, likely).

&#x200B;

I follow a lot of homestead and sustainable living blogs, and these people are always baking such wonderful homemade treats for their families. Muffins with berries from their bushes. Olive bread with olives from their orchard. On and on. Part of me was often sad looking at these, because I felt like I could never have them without the looming spectre of weight gain, of eating ""bad"" foods, etc - diet culture nonsense.

&#x200B;

Today I just realized. I can live that dream! I can bake yummy things with ingredients from my garden, and I can enjoy them with my family. I could cry with joy.

Hope you all have a great day.",1556648789.0

Any female lifters on here?,14,bhfr44,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/bhfr44/any_female_lifters_on_here/,12,"I've been considering starting weight lifting over the past couple of days.

I am a female in a larger than average body (I wouldnt be considered noticably ""fat"" of you saw me but I am heavier than average) and while weight loss would super cool and all, I'm just trying to have a good relationship with food and body after spending all of my childhood and early adolescence yoyo diet and excersicing. I just want to have healthy eating habits, which to me, means a few thigs. 1. Eating mostly fruits,veggies, grains, etc, but still eating junk/processed food every now and then bc mental health and sustainability, realism and all. 2. It means no counting calories or restricting macros or doing any sort of unsustainable crash diet. 3. No disordered perfectionist mindset which leads to binging. If I lose weight, awesome, but if I don't, ngl that will kinda suck but whatever, I'll live. 

After spending the final 2 years of high school healing my relationship with food, I got to the gentle nutrition/respecting my fullness aspect of intuitive eating which caused weight loss starting the end of my senior year. I noticed this, and I started getting peer pressured to calorie count to 1200, developed an eating disorder, and here we are. I'm maybe 75-80% mentally recovered, and I've made a full physical recovery.

I'm considering excersice again, not for weight loss, but because I've never done weight lifting before. Everytime I tried losing weight in the past, I either remained sedentary, or I did daily chronic cardio which was SO FUCKING SHITTY. I've never lifted before and I wanna see what it's like.

I have 2 issues with this. First of all, every time I see info on weight lifting, it's always surrounded by diet culture and calories and looking a certain way, and the excersices that will burn the most calories. Frankly, I'm not interested in that,and IME, the most calorie burning excersices are unenjoyable and overwork your body. I don't want to overwork myself or do daily CrossFit or fucking circuit training like these websites recommend for larger girls looking to lift. I wanna just build my strength and I want to do it whenever I want. I don't want to commit to it daily or whatever. 1-3 days a week MAXIMUM. I'm not here to look like a perfect IG ass/fitness model, I just want to experiment. 

My second issue is the fact that I don't really know where to start, the fact that the gym environment is sorta triggering, and the fact that I will frankly, feel ridiculous going to the gym as a short and semi-chubby girl in the section where it's mostly the *~sUpEr hOt fItNeSs mOdElS*~ first of all the lifting section is mostly tall bulky men, and then 2, I try not to compare myself to other women, but how can I not when most of the other girls at the lifting section are these perfect Instagram ass models? That's like a recipe to destroy any self-confidence I worked hard to build. I admit I don't have all of it (hence why I would LOVE to lose weight, though it's not something I'm focusing on or trying to work towards, and it's also why I don't consider myself fully recovered.)",1556236854.0

Diet culture undrrestimates how many calories humans need to function properly,42,bg2dqj,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/bg2dqj/diet_culture_undrrestimates_how_many_calories/,10,"Edit: I thought I typed ""underestimates"" in the title. 

Yesterday, I was reading a world atlas from 2007. There were statistics in the back, and I noticed that Eritreans consumed on average 1,590 kcal a day and Ethiopians consumed 1,950 kcal a day. I just looked up data right now, and even the hungriest countries consume ""too many"" calories according to diet culture (I'm fully aware that they don't live their lives the same way Americans do but that isn't the point). 

I was looking at Chocolate Covered Katie's blog (I like her recipes even though her blog comes across as diet-y sometimes), and she made some posts about what she eats in a day. She consumes around 2,900-3,000 calories in a day (she includes calorie counts at the bottom).  Some of the comments were like, ""If you consume that many calories, how are you not obese?"" I think that people don't understand that some women actually need that in order to function properly. 

During the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, they cut the caloric intake of these men down to 1,560, and yet you see grown men on 1,500 calorie diets. I really don't think that that's enough for them. I follow my body's natural hunger and fullness cues, and I think I consume more than 1,500 kcal on most days and I'm a five foot tall woman (I don't count calories and so I wouldn't know for sure). 

Some people might say things like ""yeah well maybe some people can consume that many calories because they have quicker metabolisms."" The thing is that caloric restriction slows down your metabolism, and people are supposed to be at different body weights. 

And pro-diet people always talk about how in Japan they're all super healthy because they ""eat so little,"" but the average daily caloric intake of a Japanese person over one year old was 1,930 in 2002. And that mean average includes toddlers who are supposed to eat around 1,200 a day. And people talk about how Americans ""eat too much,"" but  European countries don't consume much less than we do. Both the healthiest and hungriest countries consume excess calories according to diet culture. 

I have a co-worker who is trying to lose weight,  and yet she started off with a BMI of 21.9. She was likely at her body's natural set point, and yet she was brainwashed by the media into believing that she needs to be super thin and is now ruining her metabolism. The average woman even in the hungriest countries is ""fat"" by modeling standards and probably doesn't have flat abs. I once had some idiot tell me that a woman who is my height should be weighing 90 pounds and that I'm fat, but most women here on planet Earth are ""fat"" if you think that a woman's BMI should be 17.6 (which is actually officially considered ""underweight""). 

Sorry if this was too long, but it is truly upsetting that starvation is the norm in diet culture. And all it's doing is ruining people's mental health, causing deaths and contributing even more to the so called ""obesity epidemic."" Starvation doesn't help one lose weight long term.

People denying that starvation mode exists,4,bg851o,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/bg851o/people_denying_that_starvation_mode_exists/,5,"I was hate listening to a podcast from this so called ""nutritionist,"" and he said that if you stop losing weight at a certain caloric deficit, it's not because your body got used to it, but because you are obviously no longer in caloric deficit. He later on compared our bodies to cars and said that if you put less gasoline in a car, the car doesn't ever ""get used to it,"" which is a stupid comparison because our bodies are very different from cars.  Many times when I mention starvation mode, someone begins comparing the human body to a computer or a car or some other man-made machine. I think that it's such an insult to the human body since the human body is much cooler but whatever. 

If you Google ""starvation mode,"" one of the first things that pops up is an article from *cough* Weight Watchers *cough* about how starvation mode is a myth. It seems like many who deny that starvation mode exists are ones who benefit from telling people that starvation mode is a myth. Surprise. People also don't want to believe it because they think that they can't enjoy life until they lose x amount of weight. 

This so called ""nutritionist"" later on said that it's not dangerous to be in caloric deficit since you can technically survive for a very long time without food (he's sick in the head and a very abusive person). Just because you could ""technically survive"" on something doesn't mean that it's good for you. 

We have so many people telling us that it isn't real, for so many people benefit from being told that it's not real. Whenever I see someone attempt to ""debunk"" the existence of starvation mode, it's always something anecdotal like ""I just started a diet recently and lost a few pounds"" or ""diets work because I did OMAD and lost 30 pounds. I only gained it back because I'm lazy and stopped OMAD,"" and then they go into the whole ""humans are like cars"" thing.

No shit I developed an eating disorder that, now, after 5 years I'm finally in near full recovery from.

How can you recover when you believe you will need to restrict again if you ever, god forbid, have a bmi of over whatever arbitrary number we are told is ""healthy"". The Food Psych podcast really helped me come to the realization that I needed to break free of diet culture or I would stay in this relapse/recovery cycle for forever.

There is overwhelming evidence out there that diets don't work, and so they would ask themselves questions like ""hm...I wonder what does work"" if they were genuinely concerned. I'm also pretty sure that they wouldn't bodyshame people in larger bodies either, for why would you humiliate someone if you care about them? And then they claim ""fat shaming works"" even though there is overwhelming evidence that it doesn't. 

I noticed that everyone is ""complimented"" on weight loss as long as they weren't super thin to begin with. I have a coworker whom most people would consider ""normal weight"" (she has actually mentioned her height/weight to me before), and yet she's on a weight loss diet and I've heard someone compliment her on her weight loss. And while being what most would consider ""chubby"" isn't unhealthy, most wouldn't even consider her ""chubby"" at all (even before she started this diet). Like she could have been at her body's natural set point before this diet, and now she's ruining her metabolism and receiving praise for it. I know that BMI isn't an indicator for health, but even if it were, I myself was complimented on weight loss even when my BMI was already within ""normal"" range before the weight loss.

I once had some idiot tell me ""No woman's natural set point is above a BMI of 21."" Where did you get that from???? Do most women's bodies offend you???? I should be saying ""facts don't care about your feelings"" to these people, for nothing they say is evidence based and most of it comes down to ""the existence of bodies I don't like bothers me and fat people not hating themselves hurts my feelings."" 

I actually think that it has more to do with creating a hierarchy in which ""fat people=bad and lazy"" and ""thin people=good and disciplined"" than it has to do with aesthetics. If it were about aesthetics, then I think these people would care about the fact that diets actually lead to more weight gain in the long run. To quote Naomi Wolf: “A culture fixated on female thinness is not an obsession about female beauty, but an obsession about female obedience. Dieting is the most potent political sedative in women’s history; a quietly mad population is a tractable one.” 

Nothing about diet and weight loss culture is ""logical"" or ""promotes health""; it's mostly fear mongering and anecdotal evidence. They would also be concerned about eating disorders if they genuinely cared about health, and yet there's an evil subreddit in which people mock eating disorder recovery material because ""being fat is unhealthy."" Even if weight loss were the most important thing in the world and nothing else mattered, nothing they say helps promote long term weight loss.

I noticed that when you're fasting, you're mostly thinking about when you could break your fast. You feel less anxious in a way, for when you're too busy focusing on your basic needs, you don't ask yourself questions like ""Where am I going to be in five years from now?"" Once you're well fed, you start worrying about other things instead of watching mukbangs on YouTube and looking at pictures of food on Pinterest. 

Dieting/fasting makes it so that our biological needs aren't met, and in accordance with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this distracts us from confronting the uncomfortable questions in life. I remember when I did IF, I spent a whole morning thinking about food and looking up recipes. 

I think another reason why people ""enjoy fasting"" is that they see the hunger pangs as a sign that they're on their way to reaching their goal weight.  

I've checked the OMAD subreddit a few times, and many of the posts there are about how you should persist no matter how uncomfortable you may be, for it just means that you're on your way to losing weight.

This coworker then complimented the other coworker on her weight loss as if to say ""your diet's been working.""

The way she framed it was, of course I could lose the weight and I know that, I've done it before, but I'm not doing that right now. And it sounded like she was really accepting the ""should"" if that makes sense. Like she knows she should but just hasn't gotten her act together to do it.

And so I mumbled some bullshit about vague HAES stuff. I feel like I have very little credibility talking to a person in a larger body because my body is on the smaller side and I don't experience any of the stigma and crap that she does, so it's easy for me to say.

Makes me so sad how body hatred and disordered eating habits are encouraged as forms of self care and productivity,31,b5ybe8,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/b5ybe8/makes_me_so_sad_how_body_hatred_and_disordered/,2,"I was going to postpone making this post, but then I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/b5t1zb/image_note_my_husband_wrote_to_motivate_himself/). I see a lot of other things on r/GetMotivated that are like ""I've lost weight because I'm now on Keto. Never give up on your dreams."" Makes me so sad because these people are just setting themselves up for failure and making their lives even more miserable. 

I've seen so many motivational speakers say things like ""You keep going back to bingeing on the bad food even though you know it's the reason why you can't lose weight."" The thing is the reason why many of these people are bingeing is that they're restricting in the first place, and by encouraging them to ""be good"" and restrict, you're pretty much encouraging them to binge. 

I was reading a productivity book, and at one point the author was like ""even though we know we should be eating low fat foods, we still give into our impulses."" And this book was written in 2009--not the 90's. 

I'm on a Discord server for people who have been through difficult situations (not saying what type of difficult situation because it might give away the Discord server), and there's actually a ""fitness"" channel in which people post progress pics. Like I'm sorry, but I think that trying to get fit by focusing on your body will only make your healing process even worse; it will only make you hate yourself and feel like a failure. 

One of the many things I learned from Intuitive Eating is that weight loss goals and body acceptance cannot coexist. And so when you encourage people to aspire to losing weight, you're encouraging them to hate themselves and their bodies. I noticed that back when i was in diet mode, I would constantly think about my body every single time I was around food, but now I just focus on whether or not I enjoy the food. 

When you encourage people to focus on their bodies as a form of self care and productivity, you're actually making them less productive in other areas of their life. And this makes me so sad because books about productivity and subreddits like r/GetMotivated shouldn't make people hate themselves and become even more self conscious than they were before.

I've been doing the bare minimum to get by and have been pretty miserable and depressed. There are multiple reasons for this, but one of them was because of the whole diet mentality.


I have been putting things off to wait until I become skinny. When I imagine my life, I always imagined it with me being skinny. Having a nice wardrobe, travel, going out and interacting with people, etc were all imagined with me being skinny. So I have biding my time and waiting until I inevitably become skinny. Just waiting for the right diet to come along and completly change my life for the better. All I needed was the right diet and some will power and then I would be able to do everything I have dreamed of.


There is nothing stopping me from doing any of those things right now. I have the money for it. I have the time. But instead I've been struggling to just get through the days until I was ready/ deserved something better. I think a lot of this was subconcious, or even seemed normal. 


Now that I'm doing intuitive eating, I've been making peace with my body. And that has finally allowed me to see how absolutely ridiculous all of this has been. I've been torturing myself for no reason. I've been biding my time just going through the motions and not being happy because of this stupid ideal that I may never reach. 


I am really excited now. I am going to restart my life. I finally got myself new glasses. I'm going to a fancy salon to get my hair done. I have finally given myself permission to actually live my life.

Classism and ableism in diet culture,9,b3dtkd,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/b3dtkd/classism_and_ableism_in_diet_culture/,2,"I'm nauseated by the rampant classism and ableism within diet culture. 

Diet culture portrays those who are in larger bodies and/or eat fast food as ""uneducated."" They think that ""education"" is the cure for the ""obesity epidemic,"" but it's not. From what I've seen, ""education"" and ""awareness"" only leads to disordered eating habits, which includes binge eating. (I made another post in this subreddit about how my dad's binge eating habits are a result of ""education"" and ""awareness."")

Working class people who eat at McDonald's are demonized for ""not taking care of themselves,"" and those living the green smoothies yoga pants avocado toast life are praised. And knowledge is seen as morality and intelligence, for those whom they deem ""unknowledgeable"" are also seen as immoral and unintelligent. 

I was reading *Everybody Sees the Ants* by AS King a few months ago, and the main character has an aunt who is fat and portrayed as ignorant. And when the main character's mom tells his aunt that you could lose weight by consuming less calories than you burn (lmao), his aunt said something like: ""Oh I always thought they were lying to us in school. I didn't know that it was really that simple."" If it were ""that simple,"" there wouldn't be so many different diets and a $66 billion weight loss industry. They need to propagate the ""fat people are dumb and lazy"" myth so that they could delude themselves into believing that weight loss is ""simple."" 

They portray fat people as those who don't have any knowledge about nutritional information or have never heard things like ""calories in calories out"" before. I'm sorry, but many people I know who are in larger bodies are extremely absorbed in diet culture. And like I said, it only fuels their binge eating habits if anything. 

I recently got my mom to read the Intuitive Eating book, but before she read it, she told me that there are people out there who ""genuinely have no idea that kale is healthier than donuts."" I'm sure those people exist, but they are definitely a minority. They act like everyone is just stupid and ignorant and doesn't know anything and just needs to be ""more educated."" 

Ironically, this ""education"" and ""awareness"" has only contributed to the so called ""obesity epidemic,"" for dieting increases your body's natural set point and slows down your metabolism. ",1553097997.0

I usually love this show and I happened to be watching the mentioned episode last night from their new season,  and a part in this episode kinda upset me.

Antoni then asks if Robert's kids are picky, and he replies with ""Yes. Even Nova (3 years old) there, she will sometimes not even eat anything but you wouldn't even be able to tell that"".

I just don't want her to grow up being bullied and dealing with what I went through as a kid. I know I need to be making healthier choices for her"" SOMETHING like that, but he was basically referring to the fact that she was a LITTLE chubbier than your average 3 year old. This comment about a THREE YEAR OLD'S body really pissed me off. She's obviously a baby, still growing. She's going to have fat on her body. Every baby is different. And you're literally creating the situation you are trying to avoid by policing her food at such a young age and putting a focus on her body/weight.

I can't get over the fact that I was complimented on weight loss when I wasn't fully grown,21,b2zftb,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/b2zftb/i_cant_get_over_the_fact_that_i_was_complimented/,5,"I remember when I would restrict myself and lose a lot of weight at age the age of thirteen, I was told ""OMG you lost so much weight you look amazing."" I was thirteen. THIRTEEN. 

I remember going to the nurse's office in eighth grade to get weighed, and I stepped on the scale and saw that I had dropped five pounds since I had last weighed myself. I mentioned it to the assistant (the woman who was weighing me), and she said ""Oh wow that's excellent."" Like why would anyone encourage someone who is still growing to lose weight? And before I had dropped those five pounds, my BMI was in the upper range of ""average."" (BMI is bullshit but I just want to give you guys an idea of how fucked up the world is. Like you're congratulated on weight loss as long as you aren't super skinny. Just goes to show that it's more about meeting current beauty standards than it is about  ""health."") 

I remember weighing myself when I was 19 and seeing that despite being only an inch taller than I was when I was thirteen, I weighed 14 pounds more. I also ""ate better"" when I was 19 than I did at thirteen, and so I couldn't understand why I weighed more. (I know I made it a rule not to talk about weight on here but I said that it's okay as long as it's to inform everyone about the dangers of dieting and diet culture, and in this case it is. I honestly don't know how much I weigh now.) 

I wonder if dieting has stunted my growth. I've been dieting since I was eight and I'm currently only five feet tall. I'm fully aware that your height is limited by your genes (my paternal grandfather was really short), but I probably could have been an inch or two taller had I never dieted. I also used to have very thick hair, but now much of it is gone. 

You could say that the people (many of them were my age) were just ""being nice,"" and honestly I don't expect them to know any better, but it really upsets me that it's perfectly acceptable to compliment those who are still growing on weight loss. It shouldn't be okay to compliment anyone on weight loss, but especially those whose bodies/minds aren't developed. My disordered eating habits have mostly been encouraged by those around me, and simply because I was never underweight.  It's really upsetting to think about how no one cared about my health and well-being when it came to this, for being skinny is the most important thing in the world.  

I'm fully aware of the fact that I didn't even have the worst diet culture experience out there, but I just wanted to share how messed up it is that people compliment children on weight loss. My parents never put me on a diet, but I know people whose parents have, and it completely ruined their relationship to food and their bodies. Makes me so angry that some people want their four year olds to lose weight.

The OMAD subreddit looks miserable--don't tell me that people doing OMAD are happy,28,b1gz4v,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/b1gz4v/the_omad_subreddit_looks_miserabledont_tell_me/,6,"Someone was recently telling me about his OMAD experience, for he had found out that I'm anti-diet (though I had not previously discussed my anti-dieting stance with him before). He used his OMAD experience as an example of how ""diets do work,"" for he had lost 30 pounds in one month and then gained it all back. I told him that I wouldn't call something ""successful"" if it works temporarily, and he said ""Oh well I gained it all back because I'm lazy. It's not OMAD's fault."" He told me that he was super happy on OMAD because he was able to feel his hunger and fullness cues for the first time in his life and that he didn't feel deprived at all.

I then opened up about my experiences with dieting and restriction. I told him that I had been through periods of restriction and that I had severe headaches during those times. And he said ""I had headaches too."" He then told me that he used to watch things about food a whole day while he was doing OMAD, and I told him that he was doing that because he was hungry, to which he replied ""Yeah, but I felt good because I was losing weight and accomplishing my goals."" He said that it was ""really easy"" and that he knows he can do it again because he's done it before, and he kept telling me that he can't go back because he's ""just lazy."" I told him that I had been through the exact same thing before, and that his ""laziness"" is just his brain fighting his weight loss (it took me forever to accept this).

I lurked through the OMAD subreddit last night, and the first post was a meme about how distressing it is when your family is sitting down to eat and you can't eat anything, and the second post said something like: ""Sitting down to my OMAD at the end of the day with a really bad headache.""

I think that when people say that they ""enjoy OMAD,"" they probably just take pleasure in the feeling of accomplishing their goals, which will help them become more accepted in this cruel world. And as someone who fasts 6-7 times a year for non-diet/non-weight loss reasons and has done intermittent fasting in the past, food is more exciting when you are starving, but the overall eating experience is less enjoyable. When one eats after a period of restriction, it's extremely difficult to eat slowly and pay attention to your fullness cues, and you end up becoming uncomfortably full for a very long time. I don't see how anyone could eat a day's worth of calories in one sitting and then feel okay.

I think that the other part of ""enjoying OMAD"" is the thrill and excitement you get from finally sitting down to your meal, and then dreaming up what your next meal is going to be. I remember that photos and videos of food used to excite me, but they don't anymore.

Those are just my thoughts on OMAD. I have never done OMAD before, but like I said, I have very similar experiences. I keep hearing: ""Oh well it's natural for these people and they feel good doing it."" Uhm...if it were natural they wouldn't get headaches or feel stressed when their family is eating. Yes, there are some people who have been eating that way for a very long time without even referring to it as ""OMAD,"" but many times it's just because they're unaware of their bodies' natural hunger/fullness cues (which is often a result of living in a diet culture).

Mukbangs usually consist of people eating large amounts of food that is considered ""bad"" according to diet culture. And while mukbangs aren't always said to be ""cheat meals,"" they still teach us to ignore our natural hunger and fullness cues and reinforce the ""bad food is addictive"" attitude.

It doesn't mean I have to eat the muffin right away. It doesn't even mean I have to finish the muffin. It means right then, I want a muffin, and  I have the means of getting it, so that's what I'm going to damn well do.

I catch  myself automatically ""reprimanding"" my mind and body for wanting food a LOT, and I know it's what perpetuates my frequent overeating/body distrust.

But this morning - I fought that. I fought for myself. For my body's ability to tell me what it wants. And I realized that even those small ""Eh maybe I shouldn't"" thoughts are only going to contribute to me craving it (or something else) more in the long run.

So, here I am... 2 hours later, with 3/4 of a muffin still left, sipping my coffee, and typing this.

I'm glad I chose to respect my cravings and myself today.

She told me ""you can't buy this, you've had too much sugar today."" I asked her to repeat herself. I said ""whose business is it how much sugar I've had today?"" and she said ""it literally won't let me ring you up, you've had too much sugar today.""

And I replied: ""What about it was I doing incorrectly? I did everything you're supposed to do with intermittent fasting."" She jumped on me with ""you weren't doing it correctly"" before I could go into detail about my experience. I guess there's no way IF could be bad if you're ""doing it correctly."" 

And I had some other pro-dieters say to me ""You were just an unhealthy dieter."" But what is a healthy dieter? How does one distinguish ""an unhealthy dieter"" from a ""healthy dieter""? They say things like ""you're supposed to feel hungry and that means your diet is working,"" but then they'll tell you that letting yourself be hungry is what made you an ""unhealthy dieter."" While I was hungrier (and had more binges) during my diet days, I was actually very into cooking and meal planning. And I did do crash diets every now and then, and guess what? I was praised for my ""self control"" and ""willpower."" No one was concerned about the fact that I lost ten pounds within such a short period of time; they just told me that I look great and so anything I did was obviously good for me.

If your diet lead to an eating disorder or harmed you in any way, you were just ""an unhealthy dieter."" If your diet didn't help you lose any weight, you were just ""doing it wrong."" If your diet leads to binges, it's because you ""lack willpower.""

Because we have the capacity to get nutrition from so many sources, we can thrive on a wide range of foods. The traditional Inuit diet consists of no plant foods throughout the long arctic winter (they get vitamin C from whale and seal skin). The traditional Hindu diet consists of no meat whatsoever. And the human body can thrive either way.

Aspects of diet culture you were against even when you were pro-diet,8,awpk63,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/awpk63/aspects_of_diet_culture_you_were_against_even/,4,"I could think of three for myself: 

&#x200B;

**Body shaming**  I was against body shaming during most of my diet days just because body shaming is mean. I was never really pro-body shaming (except before the age of ten); it always seemed invasive to me. I never bought into the idea that body shaming could pressure people to become fit and lose weight, and I found an article via Tumblr (don't have Tumblr anymore) about how body acceptance leads to more healthful behaviors. I was pro-body acceptance for everyone but myself. 

**Reduced fat, low calorie, zero calorie, diet, etc. foods** I remember watching YouTube videos on snacks to lose weight, and they said not to use reduced fat peanut butter because they replace the fat with sugar. I was also very against aspartame and other ingredients often found in ""zero calorie"" and ""diet"" foods. I remember getting mad at my mom for buying ""low fat"" and ""calorie free"" foods. I once got annoyed when I asked her why the salad dressing tastes like poison, and she said with a smile on her face (as if she's being super health conscious): ""It's calorie free dressing."" I was like this even before Paleo, but Paleo made me into ""actual real food from the earth,"" and so I would become annoyed when Weight Watchers promoted garbage like ""fat free cooking spray"" instead of y'know...cooking fats that have one ingredient. Paleo also made me angry whenever anyone would demonize fat as a macronutrient. 

**Complimenting people on weight loss** I was against complimenting people on weight loss, for you don't know if they have an eating disorder, illness, etc. I used to get frustrated when I would tell people this and they would say: ""It's extremely rare that anyone has an eating disorder or an illness that causes them to lose weight."" I once told my mom this, and she said: ""Yeah but if someone has anorexia or a liver problem, they don't look healthy. If someone loses weight and they look healthy, it's okay to compliment them."" Whenever people would compliment me on weight loss (which was often since I had frequent weight cycles), I would politely say ""thank you"" and move on.

I’ve read one too many of those articles about how sugar is the devil, plus back in my ED days it was a major fear item....nowadays I do drink juice, because I make a point to, because fuck the system. But I still feel that little twinge of anxiety every time I drink it.

And now that I have kids, the anxiety comes out with an added force! I’m so afraid to give them sugar, especially liquid sugar (i.e., juice) that Oprah told me is especially bad. (See how long this has been a thing for me?). I actually never even questioned that belief, that my kids shouldn’t have sugar, until I started poking around the intuitive eating/ED recovery/anti-diet subs. But now I’m like, OH CRAP!!!!

So I’ve lightened up on the sugar rule. But giving them juice for some reason is still challenging to me.

Even from a weight stigma standpoint, they're just going to binge on junk food at the end of the experiment, and go through extreme hunger. Because of a suppressed metabolism, plus an extreme influx of energy, they will gain all the weight back PLUS MORE. The last starvation experiment, which was done for A GOOD CAUSE (helping to understand how to refeed European people after the war+understanding ED recovery) was done on GROWN MEN for only 6 months, and they were encouraged the regain the weight. This was the same study that proved how the metabolism slows down, how starvation effects your internal organs and brain chemistry, and how recovery WORKS. 

 This new study is basically enforced anorexia on overweight teens. I'm not even sure how this can be legal.

I also wouldn't be surprised if the vast majority of people with an anorexic mindset started off overweight. 1 in 200 women are anorexic, but I believe 1 in 20 have atypical anorexia, which is the same thing as the real deal, the only difference is their BMI. In the days of r/proED I saw the vast majority of users being at a normal weight, despite being anorexic for a long time, and so many people who were currently overweight who basically just took a diet too far. And this affects doctors taking treatment seriously and leaving people in quasi at best, relapse at worst.

I know this isn't a space to promote weight loss, but let me just say this. It is supposed to happen naturally, slowly, over time. It's pretty obvious people who lose weight without going on a specific diet, just eating healthier and embarking new hobbies and enjoying themselves, tend to lose weight slower, but are more likely to keep it off without ruining their metabolism or relationship with food.

So, I'll make the recap of my life quick to give some context for where I'm at now - I've always been a fairly restricted eater throughout childhood due to my mother being super health and portion conscious, and then a binger because my father was the opposite and let me eat whatever I wanted when I wanted it. So I felt restricted most of the time, and then binged out on stuff I was never ""allowed"" to have when I got the opportunity when I went to my dad's house. Anyway, fast forward to 17 years old, and I was tired of being the ""chubby"" girl. I don't know my highest weight during that time, but I always remember being preoccupied with if I looked ""fat"". I had a friend plant a small seed in my brain, that ""starving yourself works"", and it was downhill from there. I developed anorexia and I also ran a lot, so I was running miles and miles and then eating like 500 calories a day. I got down to my lowest weight ever (108lbs, and I'm not focusing on numbers here but just to give an idea). That lasted about a year and for the sake of not making a super long post, I'll just say I  was forced to ""recover"". If you'd call it that. I began eating again and wasn't allowed to exercise as much and I gained a good bit of the weight back (up to 130-145).

My problem is, I've never recovered from the feeling of wanting to lose weight. I now binge eat regularly, and have been for about 6 years now. I feel like I cannot stop. I've done intermittent fasting, raw till 4, just being generally restricting of my calories and such over the years to ""offset"" the binges. I'm now almost 26 and finally found IE and basically unconditional permission to eat/anti diet. I've been researching and practicing this about a couple months now but I cannot stop focusing on my weight still. I know this is the main principle of IE - letting go of wanting to lose weight - but now being at 170lbs and the heaviest I've ever been, and feeling generally uncomfortable in my clothes and body at all times- it feels so difficult. I let myself eat with MOSTLY no mental restrictions but they are hard to break. 

&#x200B;

How have you guys dealt with being in a heavier body after recovering from dieting or just dealt with weight gain in general? How have you broken the mindset of wanting to be smaller, and how long did it take? I feel like I can't stop eating even though I let myself eat whatever, whenever. It feels like it's taking me forever to settle into being 100% neutral with food and weight. Any tips or similar experiences to mine? Thank you <3",1551104804.0

Aside from the fact that studies show that [weight stigma does not lead to healthier behaviors](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-10-9#Sec11), their fears always seem irrational. 

My brother was angry about the fact that there was ""an obese woman"" on the cover of Cosmopolitan,  for they're ""encouraging obesity."" Does he seriously think that people are going to see that and go ""Oh I feel so inadequate and unattractive. Better consume an entire box of donuts""? 

I also once had someone tell me that all women can get flat abs if they work hard enough and that no woman has a natural set point that is above a BMI of 21. He pulled those ""facts"" straight out of his ass. I later realized from talking to him that he's deeply offended by the fact that women he's not attracted to are real and exist in nature. 

And I've seen people over at a certain subreddit refer to basic science as ""fat logic"" before. There was an cartoon showing how your brain thinks about food all the time when you're dieting, and they all responded with: ""This is fat logic."" Like no...that's just science. 

I was once telling a 10 y/o girl I know about how she should never count calories (when she was talking about how she's concerned about her calorie intake), for calories are just a unit of energy and are nothing to be feared. My brother then accused me of ""encouraging her to overeat."" From my knowledge and experience, restricting calories is what leads to binges. Does he seriously think that this girl is going to consume 2,000 calories per meal because she ""wants a lot of energy""? 

They seem to live in this delusional world in which people loving themselves somehow leads to more health problems. Which like...it doesn't. And when I talk about how no one should ever go on diets it's always ""You want people to die. Facts don't care about your feelings."" 

If anything, I'm the one who should be saying ""facts don't care about your feelings"" to them.

I had opened up on a Discord group I was in (was later kicked from there), and this guy was calling me and ""idiot"" and a ""femoid."" 

When I told people in real life, the ones who weren't nice gave me the usual: ""Calories in calories out"" and ""you're promoting obesity.""

I told him that everyone's body has a natural set point and that not all women can get perfectly flat abs. I was so angry at him.

He also said that no woman has a natural set point that is above a BMI of 21. Basically, this guy likes to delude himself into believing that women whom he doesn't find attractive don't exist in nature. 

And the guy who called me an ""idiot"" and ""femoid,"" called me that when I told him that BMI isn't an accurate measure of health, and that people with ""overweight"" BMI are actually the healthiest.

Halo Top is the epitome of diet culture, and so maybe I wanted to dislike it. Their whole brand encourages obsessive calorie counting and not indulging in ""bad"" treats. They also encourage not listening to your internal hunger cues because ""The whole pint doesn't have that many calories and so you could eat the whole thing."" I'm not sure whether or not that influenced my opinion on the taste of their ice cream. 

I tried the cinnamon roll flavor (dairy free), and it had sandy texture. When I told someone that it has a sandy texture, he said: ""Well that's because it has cinnamon."" I've had other ice creams with cinnamon in them before and none of them had a texture like sand. I'm a fan of all things cinnamon, and so it says a lot that I didn't like it. 

I then tried sea salt caramel (also dairy free), and it tasted like Honey Nut Cheerios in ice cream form. I closed my eyes, pretended it wasn't Halo Top, and then tasted both of them again. Nope. The cinnamon roll flavor still made me think of sand and the sea salt caramel flavor still tasted like Honey Nut Cheerios. I'm not really picky when it comes to ice cream, and so this says a lot. And I'm a fan of anything salted caramel. 

I was also told: ""Well it's dairy free so what do you expect?"" But I've tried other dairy free ice creams before, and none of them were like this. In fact, So Delicious's snickerdoodle flavor (which is both dairy free and has cinnamon) has to be one of my favorite flavors of ice cream. 

I'm just really angry that there's a company that encourages the consumption of terrible ice cream because people are too scared of calories. They encourage the whole cult like mentality in which food that is actually satisfying is somehow immoral and should be avoided at all costs.

Now as a 30-something year old, and ever since I started listening to the podcast Food Psych (amazing — check it out if you don't know it) I question whether it was ever really so bad to eat for emotional reasons.

Mine: I'm in my mid-thirties, and did the whole anorexia thing as a teenager, ""recovered"" for like five years before I actually stopped restricting, did like 2-4 years of solid binging (feasting) and occasional binge/restrict cycles in college (sometimes I was better at ignoring the ED voice than others) and gained a ton of weight, then finally gave myself unconditional permission to eat and eventually simmered down with the feast-eating, and have maintained more or less the same weight for years (my weight now would have pissed off my ED but doesn't subject me to societal weight stigma either).

Now I'm interested in antidiet stuff because I've been vehemently antidiet for the past 15 years, but never had language or community for it. I was often the only woman in my class/office/program/whatever who wasn't into ""clean eating"" or doing obvious binge/restrict cycles, putting down my own body, eating cake in a ""guilty"" way, etc. I used to be judgmental of women who were obsessed with food, but have realized that contempt for those people is just contempt for myself, and not helpful to anyone. We're all surviving diet culture as best we can.

I think that diet culture has tremendous influence on binge eating,9,atltyk,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/atltyk/i_think_that_diet_culture_has_tremendous/,5,"I have a dad who overeats a lot, and often to the point of discomfort. I once got angry at him for eating an entire box of mini cupcakes in one night, for there were none left for me or my siblings. I have also seen him eating a slice of pizza while looking through the cabinet for what to eat next. He frequently complains that his stomach is hurting and that he ate too much, and then he goes ahead and eats more. I remember that whenever I would question him about his eating habits, he would reply with ""I only do this once in a while"" and ""I ate almost nothing a whole day and so I've earned it."" And he often just flat out denies that he eats so called ""junk food"" in the first place. 

&#x200B;

I think that diet culture has played a huge part in his eating habits.  I feel like if not for diet culture, he'd ask himself ""How did eating all of that make me feel?"" instead of ""How could I justify this so I don't seem like someone who doesn't care for their health?"" He also wouldn't deny the food that he eats and would learn from the fact that eating too many cupcakes or Oreos doesn't make him feel good. Like he can't even accept the fact that he is someone who eats ""bad"" foods. 

&#x200B;

My dad was always obsessed with ""good"" vs. ""bad"" food. He had actually instilled a lot of food fears in me. He told me that saturated fat is bad, and I remember him telling my mom that all cooking oils are bad for you. He often describes foods with horrific adjectives such as ""dietetic"" or ""fattening,"" and I feel like all of this has only made things worse  for him. When I would make food for him, he'd be like ""how many calories does this have?"" I would reply with ""doesn't matter,"" and my brother would accuse me of fueling his bad eating habits. I feel like it's the diet culture that has played a huge role in fueling his eating habits; it has trained him to outwardly focus on all of his attention to food. It has taught him to justify and deny his eating habits instead of focusing on whether or not it feels good, and I know that it doesn't feel good for him because he complains that it doesn't feel good while he's doing it. I think that he would be much better off if he didn't even know that calories are even a thing. 

&#x200B;

His doctor told him that he needs to go on a diet to lose weight, and when I tell my family that it's a bad idea considering it doesn't address the root of his problems and that all of his previous attempts have failed, I get things like ""OMG why do you want him to die?"" and ""OMG you are an awful human being for discouraging him from pursuing his health."" I am concerned for his health, and that's exactly why I want him to drop the diet mentality. He's been preaching about what humans should and shouldn't eat and the dangers of being fat for years, and I could tell from talking to him that that plays a huge role in his binge eating. 

&#x200B;

I could say that diet culture definitely played a huge part in my previous binge eating habits. I also feel like if we were never taught to think of food as something ""forbidden"" or ""indulgent,"" food wouldn't come to that many people's minds when they're considering ways to cope with their emotions.

Even 3-4 months into intuitive eating, I would still feel tempted to diet whenever I ate past fullness and had a voice inside my head tell me: ""This obviously isn't working and I think you need to restrict."" I would combat these thoughts by remembering that I had more overall physical discomfort (whether it was because of overeating or undereating) back when I was in diet mode. And when that voice said ""Yeah but weight gain,"" I would just remember that diets slow down your metabolism.

Calories In Calories Out is BS,12,asxl7a,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/asxl7a/calories_in_calories_out_is_bs/,3,"And here is why:

&#x200B;

[Brain reorganization following weight loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23128762)

'The long-term stability of bodyweight despite wide variation in energy intake and expenditure suggests that at usual weight energy intake and output are 'coupled' to maintain body energy stores. Our model for some of the molecular mechanics of this regulation of energy stores is based on the concept of a neurally encoded 'threshold' for minimum body fat, below which compensatory physiology is invoked to restore body fat. The existence of such a centrally encoded threshold is supported by the similarities in response to maintenance of a reduced weight between lean and obese individuals, and the tendency for weight-reduced individuals to regain weight to levels of fat stores similar to those present prior to initial weight loss. Brain responses to food and the observed changes in energy expenditure that occur during maintenance of a reduced weight are largely reversed by the administration of the adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin.'

&#x200B;

[Effects of reduced weight maintenance and leptin repletion on functional connectivity of the hypothalamus in obese humans.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23555620)

'Treating obesity has proven to be an intractable challenge, in part, due to the difficulty of maintaining reduced weight. In our previous studies of in-patient obese subjects, we have shown that leptin repletion following a 10% or greater weight loss reduces many of the metabolic (decreased energy expenditure, sympathetic nervous system tone, and bioactive thyroid hormones) and behavioral (delayed satiation) changes that favor regain of lost weight. FMRI studies of these same subjects have shown leptin-sensitive increases in activation of the right hypothalamus and reduced activation of the cingulate, medial frontal and parahippocampal gryi, following weight loss, in response to food stimuli. In the present study, we expanded our cohort of in-patient subjects and employed psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to examine changes in the functional connectivity of the right hypothalamus. During reduced-weight maintenance with placebo injections, the functional connectivity of the hypothalamus increased with visual areas and the dorsal anterior cingulate (dorsal ACC) in response to food cues, consistent with higher sensitivity to food. During reduced-weight maintenance with leptin injections, however, the functional connectivity of the right hypothalamus increased with the mid-insula and the central and parietal operculae, suggesting increased coupling with the interoceptive system, and decreased with the orbital frontal cortex, frontal pole and the dorsal ACC, suggesting a down-regulated sensitivity to food. These findings reveal neural mechanisms that may underlie observed changes in sensitivity to food cues in the obese population during reduced-weight maintenance and leptin repletion.'

And there's more:

&#x200B;

If it were as simple as ""Calories In Calories Out,"" then there wouldn't be so many different diets and a $66 billion weight loss industry. If it were as simple as ""Calories In Calories Out,"" then there wouldn't be that many people who have been trying to lose weight for 10+ years. The diet industry benefits off of the false notion that people aren't ""knowledgeable"" (it's safe to say that the vast majority of people you know have heard of calories before) and are just ""lazy"" (many who are trying to lose weight have been on many different diets in which they had tremendous ""willpower"" and ""discipline"" at the beginning).

And people will say things like: ""The reason why diets don't work for long term weight loss is that people stop doing them."" However, it's because we are **biologically hardwired** to reject these diets. ""Willpower"" does not exist in a vacuum; we tend to overestimate how much control we have over our bodies and minds. We could only be truly free once we acknowledge how our bodies work instead of deluding ourselves into thinking that we could outsmart them.

Diets don't make sense even from a basic standpoint,18,astnh3,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/astnh3/diets_dont_make_sense_even_from_a_basic_standpoint/,0,"When I first became anti-diet, I was all about ""our bodies have not evolved for diets"" and ""statistics show that 95% of dieters gain it back"" and ""dieting slows your metabolism.""

&#x200B;

But then I realized that all of this is to be expected given the nature of diets, and that you do not need any statistics or facts about the human body to know that diets don't make sense.

&#x200B;

No one would tell someone who sleeps twenty hours a day to ""just sleep for eight hours"" or accuse them of ""having no willpower."" I don't think it makes any sense to tell such a person not to relax because ""relaxation could trigger oversleeping.""

&#x200B;

I don't think that it would make sense to help cure someone's shopping addiction by creating a budget for them and telling them to avoid certain aisles or stores because it could ""trigger them."" You wouldn't create a ""points system"" for such a person in which they could use a certain amount of ""points"" a month, and necessities like food have lower points and extraneous things like candles have higher points. I think one would want to help them get to a point in which they're no longer interested in shopping too much and nothing triggers them anymore.

Here are some of the worst ones I've heard before:

&#x200B;

**""If you're hungry, fill up on seltzer. Seltzer is very filling.""**

(I'm sorry but seltzer is not going to provide you with enough carbs and fat to help you move on with your day.)

**""If you're hungry but don't want to eat an apple, you're not really hungry.""**

(If you don't want an apple, it is probably because your body doesn't need an apple at that  moment and is craving other nutrients.)

**""If you have a problem with eating too much at night, eat less calories throughout the day so that you could save up calories for later on.""**

(Do these people think that nighttime somehow triggers overeating? Could it be that maybe overeating at night is a result of not eating enough during the day  and that eating less during the day is just going to cause you to eat even more? No. It must be the fact that it's dark outside because logic.)

**""If you're hungry but not in the mood to eat healthy food, wait two hours and then you'll be hungry enough to eat healthy food.""**

(The hungrier you are, the more likely it is that you'll want something that is high in calories and carbohydrates, i.e. ""an unhealthy food."")

**""It's okay to skip breakfast if you're hungry for breakfast when you're doing intermittent fasting.""**

(No it's not.)

**""Avoid being around your trigger foods as much as possible.""**

(I had actually believed this until seven months ago, but the more I thought about it, the less it made sense to me. The reality is that the more you withdraw from a ""trigger food,"" the more triggering it will become.)

The character Augustus Gloop is an example of how diet culture puts all the blame on the individual and demonizes fat people,10,aspqdc,antidiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidiet/comments/aspqdc/the_character_augustus_gloop_is_an_example_of_how/,6,"Augustus Gloop (from the book/movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory/Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory) is a child, and yet he's demonized for eating too much and being fat and is called  ""greedy"" because of this. And like I said, he's a child. Children who are obsessed with food usually have underlying issues. Maybe he lives in a household in which he was taught to consume tons of food to deal with his emotions. Maybe he doesn't have set meals at his house, and so food seems very exciting to him and so he fills up on chocolate whenever he can. Maybe he was never taught that there are plenty of things that you could do for fun that don't involve food. There are many reasons why a child would be obsessed with food, but it's not because they're ""greedy"" or anything. They're children. 

&#x200B;

A man like  Willy Wonka, a sadist who enjoys seeing children experience extreme levels of discomfort, should be portrayed as evil. But no, the kid who eats too much chocolate is portrayed as evil and deserves to be punished. Even if his obsession with food were 100% his own fault, he still didn't deserve to be portrayed as ""bad"" and as someone who deserves to be get stuck in a pipe. In the first movie, the Oompa Loompas say, ""I don't like the look of it,"" and I'm like...you guys aren't one to body shame but okay. And yes, three other children were punished, but I'm talking about this because I think that it's a perfect example of how diet culture puts all of the blame on the individual and thinks that they deserve to be in pain as a result of ""not taking care of themselves."" 

&#x200B;

Roald Dahl seemed to have this weird obsession with ""good"" children, and you could see this in his book Matilda as well. Matilda is a ""good"" child who is into reading and being intellectual while her parents are portrayed as complete idiots. He was also an anti-Semite, which is no surprise because he was definitely a hateful person based on what he wrote. He was extremely judgmental towards children and didn't take socialization or environment into account. I'm not saying that it's okay for children to misbehave and that all of their behavior is a result of socialization, but it's obvious that Roald Dahl hated children and fat people, for he doesn't demonize Willy Wonka for being okay with the torture of children. 

&#x200B;

I read the book and have seen both movies, but it was all a very long time ago. However, I have seen both movies many times before, and so I don't think that I'm getting anything wrong.
