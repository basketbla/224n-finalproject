The world tells us that we all must look a certain way, with images
and ideals that are unrealistic, existing only for the tiniest
fraction of humanity.  We are all imperfect in at least one way, and
that's what makes us unique.

This sub is about accepting people how they are today, without
pressure to think that they should change.

Words of wisdom,6,sugt8n,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/sugt8n/words_of_wisdom/,0,"Hi there! I wrote some words of wisdom (which is a senior tradition in my sorority) about body acceptance, and I really want to share them with a wider audience and thought this sub would be a good place! here goes..

**M's Declassified Body Positivity Survival Guide**

Trigger warning, I will obviously be talking about body image and will briefly mention eating disorders so if this is something that will make you uncomfortable please feel free to click away

To launch into this, I want to ask, has your body image ever stopped you from doing anything ever?  From wearing a cute top that you like, to having a yummy snack, to feeling confident enough to walk up and talk to someone? Can you imagine how much joy you’ve missed out on because you have been limiting your actions based on something that doesn’t ACTUALLY affect how you are allowed to curate your lived experience? You all deserve to live your life joyously and unconstrained by insecurity, so here are my top 10 tips on body positivity.

1. You don’t give a fuck about anyone else, so no one gives a fuck about you.
   1. Do you ever walk down the corner and worry that you look stupid? Do you realize that a lot of other people are also actually worrying about that for themselves at the same time? Take solidarity in this shared lived experience and realize that everyone is too concerned with themselves to be concerned with what you look like or what you are doing. I’m sure the amount of times you walk down the corner and mentally compliment someone is far greater than the amount of times you mentally judge someone. 
2. If you can love others, why can’t you love yourself?
   1. If you can look at someone else and decouple their worth from how their body looks, why can’t you do that for yourself? 
   2. I’m sure you find people of all shapes and sizes different from your own beautiful. I’m sure you find people with the exact same body type as yours beautiful. You deserve to afford yourself the same grace and aesthetic appreciation as you would afford literally anyone else.  
3. Consider how the beauty industry is founded in capitalism
   1. All traditional beauty companies in the market really want is to manipulate your perception of yourself so that they can convince you to buy things and profit off of your insecurity. 
   2. Have you ever developed an insecurity or worry that you didn’t even have until an advertisement told you that you should have it? Imagine how much better our lives would be if we weren’t constantly bombarded by advertisements related to the beauty industry. The beauty industry is built on comparison and the bet that what they show is something that you wish you could have 
   3. Think critically about how advertisements are trying to make you wish you were different, just so they can sell you something. Often, they are attempting to convince you that what they sell to you  an ideal reality when they really they just sell a product you will waste your money on and actually will make you feel worse about yourself
   4. The capitalistic beauty industry also needs change in order to push new products and continue to make money. This is why beauty standards are constantly changing. The fact that beauty standards are constantly changing also is great proof that every moment you spend trying to shape yourself and your image in a certain way that is deemed attractive can so quickly go to waste as soon as the trend changes, so you might as well just learn to love the body you have now. 
4. Remember that everything is not as it seems 
   1. \*Cue the wizards of Waverly place soundtrack\*
   2. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ADVERTISEMENTS ARE SO EASILY MANIPULATED, AND MANIPULATED SO WELL THAT IT SEEMS REALISTIC THESE DAYS 
   3. However, so few of the images put out in the market by large corporations are un-retouched. 
   4. Trust nothing, be critical. 
   5. Remember this especially when scrolling through social media as high quality retouching is accessible to everyone now with face-tune 
   6. On that note, I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend weaning yourself off of face-tune. Enhancing colors and brightness in photos is fine, but fundamentally changing something about your body through editing and filters is damaging to your own self image as well as the mindsets of those who consume your content. 
   7. Speaking of social media…
5. diversify your feed
   1. Intentionally follow people that look like you, follow people that don’t look like you on both ends of the spectrum
   2. In all ways, including in the bodies you see 
      1. Race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, size!
   3. I also think it is important to de-aspirational your feed
      1. Do not follow “fit-spiration” accounts 
      2. Do not follow people that you only follow out of envy 
      3. Spending hours on social media scrolling through images of what you wish you were does nothing but hurt your self image.
   4. I think this is a good place to mention men’s body positivity and the double standards surrounding them is something to consider when orienting yourself in the world of body positivity. I also think it is important to acknowledge that people with gender differences and dysphoria have varying levels of body-image related issues as well and that this is not just a straight-white-female problem.
6. Analyze the decisions you’re making in relation to your body 
   1. Are you working out because it makes you feel good and will help you live longer, or are you working out to look a certain way? 
   2. Are you choosing it because it will fuel your body in the way that you need it to, as well as taste yummy, or are you choosing a certain snack or meal because it will change how your body looks?
   3. Are you putting on that outfit because you like it and it expresses your tastes, or are you putting it on because it shapes your body to fit a certain popular beauty standard
   4. Looking more deeply into these decisions can help you better understand how to dismantle your own negative self perception and tendencies. 
7. Physically treat your body with kindness 
   1. Instead of pinching or rubbing or poking at the parts of your body that you don’t like, when was the last time you lovingly and tenderly touched them? Physical actions can help shape our thoughts 
   2. Do not wear tight and uncomfortable clothes for any longer than you truly want to! Take that bra off when you get home! Peel yourself out of those jeans! 
   3. Speaking of clothes, clothes are made to fit your body, you do not need to make your body fit the clothes. You do not need to lose weight to be worthy of wearing any type of clothing. Do not hold onto clothing that no longer fits in the hope for motivation to change. Do not buy clothing as motivation to change. Buy and keep what fits now. 
   4. Rest when you need rest. If you think working out is beyond your mental energy scope for the day, then it is ok to skip a day. Muscles are not built overnight, nor are they lost overnight. 
   5. Eat when you are hungry. So often boys are encouraged to eat a lot when they are young because they are “growing boys” but women are introduced to diet culture at a scary young age through the media. Food is essential for survival. Beyond that, food is a source of joy. You need to eat. You are allowed to eat for joy, not just for survival.
   6. Thank your body for everything that it has done for you. This is the only one you get. Thank her for every happy experience she has allowed you to participate in, and thank her for every hard one that she has carried you through. Your body is your ally, not your enemy. 
8. Raise your standards, lower your expectations for everyone, including yourself
   1. This piece of advice I mostly apply to dating and relationships and I could do a whole words of wisdom on this alone, but also can apply to your relationship with your body 
   2. If you wouldn’t let your best friend talk a certain way about your body, why would you let yourself? Would you go back in time and say the nasty things you say to your younger self?
   3. Also be kind to yourself on your body positivity journey. It is its own version of a mindfulness practice. notice the negative automatic thoughts, identify what they are and where they are coming from, and correct them, and thank yourself for choosing to be kind to yourself. These thought habits have been built over two whole decades and will take time to dismantle and reassemble. Like Ikea furniture.
9. On a serious note, Seek professional help if you think you need it
   1. Disordered eating is a serious issue and everyone struggling with it deserves love, compassion, and help. If you think you are struggling with disordered eating, please seek professional help
10. IF BODY POSITIVITY SEEMS TOO FAR OUT OF YOUR REALM, GO FOR BODY NEUTRALITY 
   1. Body neutrality is often defined as the idea that you can exist without having to think too much about your body one way or another, positive or negative. You can simply exist and be worthy of respect without thinking about your body at all.
   2. I personally think both body positivity and neutrality can and should be practiced in unison
   3. This also is important as it is important to decouple your worth and anyone’s worth from their body and relationship with it
   4. Your body is the least interesting thing about you. You are a strong, smart, talented, vivacious, interesting person on your own, and how you look has exactly ZERO bearing on that. 
   5. In contrast to that, there is a forced separation we so often create between mind and body. The body is not just a vessel for your thoughts, it is your conduit for your lived experience, it is how you interact with the world. Be grateful for YOU, but also realize that the aesthetic aspects of your body should not shape your relationship with it.  
   6. A final question on this note.. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life unhappily chasing a standard rather than accepting the body that you live in? This is not to guilt you for wanting to change, but I think provides some perspective on what is truly important in life.

I’ll conclude by saying this– body positivity and/or body neutrality is hard. So hard. I am still unlearning the toxicity shoved into our brains over our whole lives. Every day is a struggle. But every day is a chance to fight to love yourself, because you deserve it. You deserve to wear that crop top or tight dress, you deserve to get that ice cream on a hot summer’s day, you are a damn catch and any friend or romantic interest would be lucky to have you, and you deserve to go through life without constantly being weighed down by constant awareness and negative perceptions of your body. Go confidently, and be kind to yourself, and be kind to your body.",1645075085.0

Nose tip and middle of lips misaligned(Misaligned philtrum)?,2,sczujt,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/sczujt/nose_tip_and_middle_of_lips_misalignedmisaligned/,4,"So the other day while looking in a mirror, I noticed that the little groove in the middle of my lips and the tip of my nose don't line up. I measured it with a ruler and it doesn't seem to be a lot when you bring it down to numbers(around 4 millimeters) but to me it looks like a lot.  


The thing is, scrolling through social media and looking at the faces of my friends/people I follow, I feel like I've never seen this on anybody else. Even celebrities; I can't seem to find any celebrities with this misalignment, the closest thing is Tom Cruise but that's more to do with his teeth than his lips+nose tip.  


Am I crazy? This is really putting me down because it just looks so so off. I keep manually moving my lips to the side with my face muscles to try and align them with my nose because I can't stand the thought of someone noticing this.",1643180296.0

"The harm that exists in boiling people down to their weight and appearance through ""compliments"" and weight discussion.",60,s44ipb,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/s44ipb/the_harm_that_exists_in_boiling_people_down_to/,3,"\[TW: Weight Loss and Hurtful Comments\] 

Mods, please remove if this is in violation of rules in any way. 

Right now, I can confidently say that I am not in a good place regarding my mental health. Lately, I have been really reflecting on how I got here. I have been asking myself how I lost touch with the imperfect, but secure, confident, joyful person I once was. I have been fighting to get back in touch with her.

In late 2019, I made a few changes WITHOUT the intention of changing my body. I was in an excellent, self-care oriented headspace, and I ended up losing a noticeable amount of weight. I didn't even notice this or think about it, just carried on as per usual. A turning point occurred when people around me began noticing and reacting openly. First, it was light ""compliments"" on the weight loss. I was surprised to hear these compliments, and relatively unaffected by them, and I would move on quickly. 

As time went on and the loss continued (not on purpose), the topic of the change in my body began to dominate my interactions with my friends and loved ones. People would go on and on in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable and objectified. Everyone would be standing around me, asking me ""how I did it"", what ""diet"" was I on, what was my secret? Making terrible comments about their own weight and comparing their own bodies to mine. Some of the ""positivity"" and ""compliments"" took a really ugly turn, and my weight loss was announced to everyone in a room as something everyone should congratulate me on. Some of it turned really dark and sour. More than once, I had the same individuals telling me that I was now too skinny, and people musing on whether or not I had an eating disorder right in front me. It was crushing. I was pushed to the point of tears a few times. 

More than anything else, it started a habit of fixating on myself and my appearance in a way that I NEVER had before. I began to feel the crushing insecurity and obsession with my physical appearance that I am now plagued with. These things truly had never even crossed my mind pre-2019. I took joy in my hobbies and interests and truly lived in the moment. 

The ""compliments"" and commentary on my weight loss boiled me down to my appearance, when I was and still am SO much more than that. Right now, I am trying so hard to dig myself out of this hole I am in and get back in touch with the version of myself that brought me the most joy. I really think that we have got change the dialogue surrounding weight loss and the commentary and compliments that follow weight loss. It has hurt me so deeply.",1642199389.0

But it is the only one. 

The males in my family on both sides are extremely hairy all over; back, chest, arms, beard, everything but the top of there heads(not a problem for me as of yet)

Triggered by a post on another subreddit,33,s3h1sv,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/s3h1sv/triggered_by_a_post_on_another_subreddit/,5,"TW: weight discussion, eating disorder

This is my first time posting here, so I hope I’m doing it right/not breaking any rules. I just saw a post on another subreddit that was filled with comments judging a young girl’s weight. Apparently it’s okay to bash a teenager on the internet now (I guess that’s really nothing new when it comes to fatphobia)? The commenters must surely have all been MDs with all the medical advice they were giving (she’s “likely on her way to diabetes”, etc.). I found one comment that I agreed with saying a child shouldn’t be dieting (according to much research on weight, health, and eating disorders, no one should really be dieting — dieting is literally considered disordered eating by experts in the field [I studied under one]), but of course once they heard about the girl’s exact BMI (BMI is not at all a good predictor of health if you look at the academic research!) they made an edit to say “actually, yes, they should be on a diet”. 

Anyways, sorry about the angry rant. The reason I think this has me so worked up is because I used to have an eating disorder and when I recovered my weight went up pretty drastically to what some would consider “overweight” (not a great term to use, but alas if you’re over society’s expectation for weight that’s what you’re considered). This is of course to be expected — I was anorexic for years, my set weight went up after that, and some people’s set weights are where I am without having an eating disorder for years. Of course I got tons of opinions and “expert” advice from my family about how I should lose weight when my weight first went up (now people know that if they talk to me about my weight in any kind of negative way I will literally walk away in the middle of the conversation — yay for boundaries!). Recently due to stress, depression, and vomiting (often multiple times a day) due to anxiety attacks, I’ve lost some weight pretty rapidly. It’s really not ideal at all, and I’m worried that when I see myself becoming thinner I may fall into old “habits” (not eating or purging). I feel like no one cares/everyone thinks it’s good that I’m losing weight, which it really isn’t. So now I think I’m a little more sensitive to weight stuff right now, hence the rant.

Anyways, if you took the time to read this, thank you. If anyone has any words of encouragement as well, I would happily accept them.",1642128017.0

Sweet Scented Wildflower,40,s02gc3,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/s02gc3/sweet_scented_wildflower/,4,"There’s a quote by Beau Taplin; “Listen to me, your body is not a temple.

You will grow back, over and over, no matter how badly you are devastated”

I now have a wildflower tattoo because of this quote. I have always been so down on myself because of my body and have never truly accepted it. I have always been concerned about what I’m eating, how much I weigh, and what I look like in the mirror. It obviously took a toll on my mental and physical health.

How to deal with harsh comments from your own mother?,38,ru8yyw,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ru8yyw/how_to_deal_with_harsh_comments_from_your_own/,21,"I was about to post here yesterday, but even after reading through the rules I somehow managed to break one of them - apologises for that. ❤️ Let's try again.

I am looking for tips on how to deal with some harsh comments from your family. I'm 31F and in some sort of a crisis with my mother, who is just not understanding my point _at all_. We've just had a massive argument over MY BODY, as I have ONCE AGAIN, told her that she is not allowed to comment on my weight or appearance.

I think I kind of lost it today when she posted the same old stuff to our family WhatsApp group. Sending me just another link to join an online diet plan, this time in front of the whole family. I've been through this same thing with her so many times throughout my life. I now finally told her that I believe this has all started in my childhood. I said I don't want to blame her because her intentions have been good... But it's impossible to ignore the fact that my experiences in childhood has affected my relationship with food, my confidence and mental health. And this has now hurt her feelings and she is accusing me for blaming her on the situation.

Basically, I've always been pushed to join diets and lose weight. My mom made me join Weight Watchers when I was 16 (the age limit is 18 but they allowed me in). After that, I tried multiple different diets - aaand always failed. Obviously. Always left me feeling like a failure. And my mom always reminds me of it. Comments about my weight and how I need to do something about it. And it always hurts, and she knows it. When I lived abroad, she used to send me stuff by mail and the parcel always had a weightloss article in it. I can't do it any longer. What I want, is to work on my fucked up relationship with food - but how can I do it when my own mom just won't stop doing this?! 

My family is the best really, I had a lovely childhood etc - but this has left me scarred. And I would like to think that they only mean good which is what makes this difficult. I've tried to explain to mom how much it hurts and that her comments don't help at all  - but she doesn't get it. Her final argument is always: ""But it's a health risk"". This time she said that the only thing to help me will be a surgery if I don't diet well enough. 

How would you deal with this? It's my body, it's my life, I'm 31 FFS. And I still feel so awful. Been down to the Memory Lane today and gosh it hurts. I hope this all made sense, my brain is so foggy today.",1641127693.0

People should really stop commenting on others’ body,119,rs0pe7,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rs0pe7/people_should_really_stop_commenting_on_others/,12,"I (28F) just put a picture of me in high school (age 14-15) on my fb story. Someone who just saw me a month ago made this comment underneath: “You lost a lot of weight 👏🏻👏🏻”

The funniest part (or tragic depending on one’s point of view) is that I’m not even anything like what i looked like in that photo. I had very long blonde hair then, now I have a pixie cut. My face obviously, and inevitably, changed a lot since my adolescent years. But this person who looked at that picture didn’t even bother to notice that the ‘woman’ she saw a month ago can’t possibly be that girl in that picture. Instead she directly looked at how my weight changed and decided to compliment me on that aspect which turned out to be an insult since it’s obviously the other way around. And of course this well-meant remark added to the list of body-shamings I’ve been subjected to since I gained a bunch of weight this past year.

The bottom line is that even when a compliment is the intended outcome it’s not a good idea to comment on people’s weight or any other physical features. Because you never know when you might unintentionally hurt feelings. Also it’s not our job to put a label to what others look like. It’s just presumptuous…",1640867397.0

I would have thought I’m plus size, but clothes at the plus size store are too big, yet clothes at the regular stores are too small, so I feel like I’m in an awkward middle spot where it’s hard to find clothes that fit, and because of this I’d now say I’m “mid-size”, but now this post circulating is saying it’s a fat phobic term?

Partners family is so judgmental of our bodies,46,rpujxq,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rpujxq/partners_family_is_so_judgmental_of_our_bodies/,5,"[TW: discussion of ED/weight] This is a long one, I apologize, but I need some advice. So my partner (27M) and I (25F) are home visiting his family for the holidays and it has been lovely aside from one constant looming issue, his dad and step mom are extremely pushy and judge mental of our weight/bodies/food choices/exercise habits. Since our arrival it has been brought up multiple times a day every day. 

For some background, my partner and I are overweight but just do not prioritize weight loss in our lives right now. I have a history of severe disordered eating and have worked extremely hard to get to the other side and feel comfortable in my every day life. My partner’s step mom has an active eating disorder and is extremely restrictive and strict about what she’s “allowed” to eat (the woman brings her own dressing to restaurants because she doesn’t trust the dressings available there) and his dad has picked up a lot of these behaviors as well and is obsessed with talking about weight loss and how good/bad foods are. 

Since we have arrived they have skipped at least one meal a day (usually both breakfast and lunch), banned Christmas cookies and dessert from the house, skipped Christmas dinner (we had a plain pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli instead), and keep making  subtle comments about how we shouldn’t be hungry or we should go on a walk or don’t need a snack or that we won’t be eating out at all while we’re here because everything in a restaurant is “bad food”, it’s absolutely maddening.

I’m really struggling with all of it and frankly want to leave, but they have always been so kind and welcoming and we’ve always loved them so nobody wants to step on their toes but I just feel like crap about myself and am struggling to maintain my healthy view of food/meals/my body. My partner is also pretty effected by it but he doesn’t have the same history so he’s been just ignoring it. How do I make it through the next 5 days without a full relapse into behaviors it took me years to overcome? I feel hopeless… and hungry 🥲",1640631683.0

Advice for accepting unexpected changes?,4,rkyz86,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rkyz86/advice_for_accepting_unexpected_changes/,3,"Hello!

I'm new to this group and hoping I can get advice or ideas. Before I jump into where I'm getting stuck, I'd like to mention that I do currently have a therapist and I've also got a dietician for support in nutrition, so no advice needed there.

About 6 months ago, I suddenly gained weight. I've been mostly the same size for years, so this was very uncharacteristic and startling. The scale says 15 lbs, clothes say 2 sizes.

I'm struggling in 2 areas:
1. My body looks and feels different now, and because there's no measurable reason why, I'm having a hard time mentally catching up with it. I had an imperfect body before, I have an imperfect one now. But it's very odd to look in the mirror and see a body that isn't familiar anymore. Not knowing what caused the change is also disturbing to me (is something wrong?), hence the dietician appt.
2. I feel like a hypocrite. I've always been a big proponent of body positivity/acceptance, intuitive eating, health at every size, etc. I don't hate my body, but my struggles to accept it are making me feel like my beliefs only went skin-deep. I know that's not true (I don't look at anyone else's body and feel the same criticism that comes up when I look at mine), but has anyone else felt that? 

This is all messing with my head quite a bit.

Anyway, if anyone has been here and has tips for what helped them settle in and accept their body suddenly and unexpectedly changing, I would love to hear it!",1640039388.0
How to help with body image issues,32,rk9621,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rk9621/how_to_help_with_body_image_issues/,11,"My little sister, who's only 9 years old, is having issues with her body image. She's told me and others in the family several times that how she looks makes her feel sad. I'm looking for advice on how to help her with that and I hope this is the right place for asking, couldnt post in the body image subreddit because I'm not active in it. 

In our family we're always a little bit 'chubby' as children and the girls usually grow faster than other girls their age, so I understand that she looks 'bigger' in general compared to her friends but it's litterally just how she grows. She's healthy, very active (does dancing, biathlon, skates, exercises at home as well) and she is a very pretty girl. I just worry that it could become an unhealthy obsession, especially in a few years when she becomes a teenager. She's also got a cousin who died of anorexia, idk if there's an increased risk because of genetics or not but just fyi if it's relevant.

So basically I'm wondering how I could help. I understand that the issue is probably with media representation and societal expectations on girls bodies more than how she actually looks and as a guy, who hasn't had the same kind of issues, I feel that I'm not really equipped to help and could use some advice if anyone's willing to share.",1639957667.0

Not looking for anyone to judge me here. This place should be free of any criticism.

I really try not to beat myself up over this, but every time I have certain events in my life that make it hard for me to exercise daily, I notice the change in my body within a week, and it really discourages me. Recently ive been working seasonal in retail and as you know the holidays are super busy. I even got sick a few days ago and had to stay home. This resulted in barely moving around for 3 days. 
I realize that when im not active im more tired and i get in this habit of not exercising, which sucks because I genuinely enjoy my work outs, and the feeling I get knowing im closer to my goal (which is honestly staying healthy enough to go hiking and do full push ups)

A lot of these high hour demanding jobs are killing people. They dont have any time for themselves:/",1639798181.0
Years to finally accept my body as it is,43,rij7wr,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rij7wr/years_to_finally_accept_my_body_as_it_is/,2,"Long time lurker, first time poster. As AMAB, I have had a life long condition that has put my hormones at odds and for years has caused much distress and even bullying well into adulthood. I have what is known as Gynecomastia, where my testosterone and estrogen are out of balance and both fight for dominance.  This has caused my body to become feminine in some places and male in others, most notable in the chest where I have developed prominent breasts requiring support. While I am not alone in my condition,  it's not as common as the more common ""man boobs"" of overweight men and is easily mistaken as just a trip to the gym will fix it.

It has taken me years to accept my body for what it is while maintaining my masculine birth. While it's still a struggle at times dealing with a trait that society deems ""for women only"", these days I am at peace with my body and am learning to enjoy life as I should be. It is possible. Thank you.",1639753133.0
50 “something” years old and exhausted by my brain,3,rih24o,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rih24o/50_something_years_old_and_exhausted_by_my_brain/,22,"At 40 yo I had made a pact with myself that I would no longer care what others thought. It actually got worse. 

Now as I am in my 50’s you’d think I’d really be able to embrace this concept. But no, it’s even worse yet! So bad that I barely leave my house.

I feel like it’s never going to happen for me. I have been to therapy over the years but I guess I haven’t heard the right “words” yet that make acceptance click.

What “words” or “sayings” helped make it click for you? For example, in 12 step programs they have many sayings like “one day at a time”and “keep it simple”. Or if it wasn’t a saying, maybe a certain set of actions that helped you? A book or even a really good therapist on the east coast?

What are some microagressions you have faced as a overweight person?,68,r66joc,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/r66joc/what_are_some_microagressions_you_have_faced_as_a/,29,"I can’t believe there is a sub on Reddit where people are openly fatphobic and “dismantle” the concept of fatphobia. Someone said fatphobia isn’t like homophobia because queer people are born queer and fat people aren’t born fat but if you use that logic then people who were disabled after birth can’t say they face ableism. There are a variety of factors that can contribute to someone being overweight, like mental health, poverty, health reasons and many more things that happen after birth. It’s Honestly heartbreaking to see how some people think. 
Anyways I have a hard time deciphering what someone’s intentions are when they say or do something backhanded because I’m not only overweight but I’m also a black woman. 

One example of a fatphobic microaggression I can think of is when I was 13 around the holidays my older cousin cooked a feast for thanksgiving. I ate a few bites of macaroni and got full. When she heard that I was no longer hungry she got angry. I guess she expected me to eat more than I did because I was the biggest. She cracked a few jokes about my eating to everyone then wanted me to continue eating despite the fact I was full.",1638333651.0

Did anyone else have a mom that taught them to hate their body?,11,r4ofgm,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/r4ofgm/did_anyone_else_have_a_mom_that_taught_them_to/,4," 

When I was eleven and I discovered that I had stretch marks on my thighs, the first thing my mom told me was that stretch marks happen when you gain weight too quickly. That I should try my hardest not to get any more. They were permanent and I could never get rid of them, like a tattoo. And my mom hated tattoos.

When I used to go shopping with my mom for clothes, she’d manipulate me into buying clothes that were too small for my body. She’d try to use them as a motivator to get me to lose weight. I never lost the weight to fit into them, and instead, from the ages of nine to fifteen, I wore clothes to school that were too tight and very uncomfortable.

My mom has physically ripped food out of my hands before.

She used to pat my stomach when we were out in public.

If we went to a restaurant and I ordered something with a lot of pasta or bread, my mom would make sure to tell the waiter “you can tell she’s the one who likes carbs in the family”

And it wasn’t as though I was a fat kid growing up. I was a normal little kid with a normal amount of body fat and a normal child-size tummy. But because of the way my mom talked to me about my body, I believed her and spent some of the earliest years of my life negatively obsessing over my self-image.

I don’t think any other seven-year-old in my second-grade class was worried about how fat they looked.

When I was in fifth grade and I needed a training bra, my mom told me that it was because I was eating unhealthily. I felt so ashamed to have breasts. 

When I was twelve and I decided that I no longer wanted to play field hockey, I was so scared that my mom would think less of me because I wasn’t doing something athletic. I thought that she’d see me as even fatter and grosser than she had before.

In eighth grade when everyone was hitting puberty and growing up, my mom would point out how all the other girls my age were thinning out and I wasn’t. It made me feel horrible. I felt like I was doing something wrong.

I ate the same foods as everyone else, but to my mom, my body was never good enough. 

And now even though she’s cooled down somewhat, I still struggle.

I struggle with my self-image. I struggle with eating in front of people. Clothes shopping is so dysphoric and almost always ends in me crying. If my mom is in the kitchen and I’m hungry, I wait for her to leave. If I’m out to dinner with her, ordering what I want always results in a myriad of poking and prodding; “ooh, that looks good, my body can’t handle all that grease and fat.” “Are you really going to eat all of that?” 

One time my friend was over at the house, and we were eating cookies. I asked my mom if I could have another, and she immediately took the cookie box out of my hands and told me how crazy I was for wanting another one because of their calorie count. My friend told me he felt sorry for me that my mom was willing to do that and embarrass me in front of my friend. It wasn’t until then that I fully realized that my mom is the one with the problem, not me. 

Since having that realization a few months ago, I've started appreciating myself more. I've never felt more myself than I do right now. I can look at myself and be proud of who I am. I don't tear myself apart every time I look in the mirror. I don't force myself to skip meals. I don't discount myself. I am amazing on my own. My body is absolutely a fucking temple and it's beautiful and incredible and so fucking powerful. My body is going to do what it wants. It's okay for me to have stretch marks. It's okay for me to have breasts. All of that shit is normal. My mom has her own problems and I can choose not to listen. I'm pushing through.",1638163559.0

I’ve never encountered anyone with the same body as me.,38,qv9895,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/qv9895/ive_never_encountered_anyone_with_the_same_body/,3,"All my (27f) life people have always told me I have big hands feet and long arms. I’ve looked it up and believe I might have so mild Marian syndrome. The only reason why I say that is because I’m only 5’3 and my body is not proportional. 

My arms are longer than they should be. My fingers and toes are long. My ankles and wrists are tiny so they make my hands and feet look even bigger. I wear size 8 and most clothes are not fitting for me.

My ribs are caved in BUT not in the middle. It is at the very end of my ribs so they look pointy. Right under my breasts it’s clear my ribs dent in. I have mild scoliosis on top of that. 

I’m insecure of waving or showing my feet. I wear baggy clothes because of my uneven hips due to scoliosis. I wish to know what exactly it is and if anyone has this problem. I wish I had normal limbs. Thank you.",1637073598.0

Is my appearance so important?,39,qt0qmj,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/qt0qmj/is_my_appearance_so_important/,7,"Yesterday one of my friends and my mam commented a picture of me and told me things like I look ''like a man'' and my smile is weird. I didn't even ask them to look at the picture. They probably just wanted to tease me but it hurt and made me quite sad because I thought that this picture of me is not too bad. I deleted the picture afterwards. I am not conventionally beautiful, but I have been trying to accept what I look like and I don't actually think I am so hideous, but now I am wondering if the perception I have of myself is wrong and all people can see is this ugly creature that I apparently am.

Is my appearance really so important? I want people to like me because of my personality and not because I look a certain way. I hate it when I am reduced to my appearance because I think I am so much more than that. But I am wondering if my way of thinking is just naive and I will always be seen as ugly no matter what I do.",1636808269.0

Let me be fuzzy,30,qs5pts,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/qs5pts/let_me_be_fuzzy/,1,"While desperately looking for that chic ethnic FIT I can slay in for Diwali, I came across this awesome sleeveless Kurti which was perfect...but it was sleeveless that means SHAVING! 
God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

A personal example is that when I was about 13 I was shopping with a friend and tried on this gorgeous yellow dress and when I came out of the dressing room, my friend looked at me and said “wow yellow really doesn’t suit you.” Yellow had always been my favourite colour and it took me years to feel comfortable wearing yellow again.

I'm a large guy with a small penis so I never had much confidence with women. I recently had sex for the first time with someone who made me feel special and seen. It made me realize how badly I've been treating myself for how I looked and how my body is. I realized I need to work toward healing the relationship with myself. I also want to surround myself with more understanding and accepting people like her. I'm scared and excited about where this journey will take me and I have hope I will end up in a better place.

I was getting ready for bed and happened to look in the mirror half undressed and was comparing my body posed vs candid, criticising my candid body and wishing it looked how it did when I suck in and work my angles. I don't know why, but I decided to take photos of both, by setting up a self timer. 

I know a lot of people don't find these kind of images helpful or empowering, and maybe not when it's someone else. But weirdly, putting the two images side by side felt really affirming. For some reason right now I feel more self connection and compassion.

I've suffered with self esteem issues my whole life, I'm chubby, I have loads of stretch marks from weight loss and I'm suspected to have PCOS which, if I do, causes me to have dark hair on my arms and face which I have been shaving and hiding for years but seeing a subreddit like this is really uplifting.

Mis and fat disclaimers on dating apps,51,q27mqx,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/q27mqx/mis_and_fat_disclaimers_on_dating_apps/,14,"I've (25F) been talking to a girl I met on the apps for a while now. She's postponed our first date twice and is very active and fit. I usually don't make disclaimers about my body, I just let the full body photos on my app speak for themselves. Today she made a comment about being chubby after eating xyz, and she's made diet talk and body comments about herself before, so I asked to make sure she knew what my body looks like. She said she didn't mean it offensively but ultimately was offended for not feeling she can say anything without being judged (earlier I had asked for clarification on how she felt after she replied just ""ok"" to another topic where I thought I offended her with my boundaries, I thought she was upset/being short). It's so hard to discern tone from texts and it's mercury retrograde, so I'm hoping someone here can understand where I'm coming from. I shouldn't have let my past experiences and insecurity effect me but I did.

Edit: this was supposed to be titled ""miscommunication and..""

Edit 2: Thanks everyone who responded and validated my gut feeling. I agree that she didn't respond well, and overall is not what I'm looking for in a partner. Even if she didn't mean anything by her comments she should have been able to apologize, communicate respectfully, and not put all the blame on me. I didn't totally see that before because I'm so quick to accept fault in situations, but I do now and I'm glad I made this post.",1633474195.0

I posted on an emotional support discord server asking to talk to someone about weight and body image. I specifically said that I wanted someone to listen to me. I am having anxiety at work, and the emotional support hotline I call isn't picking up.  When a poster offered to help me out over DM, he then asked me ""why is this so important to you"" within 5 min of talking. I shared a bit about what I was struggling with, and he asked that question. I told him that his question isn't helpful. I ended the convo, bc I didn't think we were a good match. 

Does anyone not like having to explain why body image is an important issue? To me, there's so much information out there on why it is important. In fact, I think it's common sense that many women struggle with body image concerns. I don't want to be in a position where I have to educate someone on something that is naturally important to a lot of women (and some men). 

I complained to one of the mods on an emotional support server. The posters on there pride on being empathetic. Everyone has the right to feel upset over they are struggling without having to explain ""why."" Sometimes, there isn't a clear reason.  

For those who say ""maybe he was trying to help or get you to think, l have analyzed the issue on my own of why body image is important to me millions of times over the years. What I was looking for empathy...not being prodded on how my issues came about. 

Not to mention that my body image issues stem from trauma. Why do I want to rehash complex trauma to a stranger who I just met for five minutes?

Although I got a lot of supportive comments on the post ❤️ I feel embarrassed that I’m ruminating about what she said to me. So, I want to ask if there’s anyone here who was a skinny child but gained weight during puberty?

Today she told me that I was never fat when I was a baby or child and of course not, I hadn’t even hit puberty yet lol (I’m black and it’s natural for women within my race to be a little bigger anyway but that’s beside the point).",1631943249.0

Advice for my girlfriend,30,pmjho8,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/pmjho8/advice_for_my_girlfriend/,8,"Recently, my girlfriend told me she is likely to get a waist trainer. After further discussion, we made some conclusions together. She doesn't like her body. She says that she thinks the waist trainer will make her feel better because she thinks the feeling of her waist being squeezed makes her feel more comfortable. I think that there is too much correlation between the two subjects and that she is getting one not for the ""feel"" but rather the look.

There was lots of people ""preaching"" her saying ""you are so brave!!"" and ""I have the same body type and I hate it but you look cute"". Why those comments? Cause that girl didnt had an Instagram model body type.

If you look comments on a post from a normative girl you will only see compliments about how hot she looks, yet if we have an /average/ body we are supposed to be ""brave"" to show it? Like the normal thing were to be ashamed of it?

Maybe I'm reaching but I found it the opposite to normalizing it when people say these things like you are beautiful *despite* your body type and if you show it you are *brave* like it should be hidden or what?

When I was in secondary school smartphones were brand new so only the very rich children had them and Instagram wasn’t even heard of! I am very aware of how easy it must be for teenage girls to become enthralled by very heavily edited images of long legged, little headed reanimated Bratz dolls but I really don’t want it to fuck her up! She is a very intelligent and well mannered young lady and in no way overweight, she is however taller and sturdier than a lot of her friends. She is adamant she’s a size UK 8 but she has to squeeze into them and would be much more comfortable in a size 12. She gets very upset at this and refuses to wear anything over a size 10 but is visibly uncomfortable. She is now unwilling to shop in a few different high street shops saying their sizing is wrong (I know this can be the case but in this instance it’s a coping machine). How do I make her realise there is nothing wrong with being a size 12 and she’s gorgeous regardless of what the label in her jeans says? It’s such a sensitive subject and I don’t want to do more harm than good. Thanks In advance",1630065789.0
Recruiting Participants for the Family Body Project in Oregon,17,pcbl4e,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/pcbl4e/recruiting_participants_for_the_family_body/,0,"Hello all,

In today’s society, people are expected to conform to beauty standards more than ever. Adolescent girls are an especially targeted and vulnerable population as companies aim to profit off of their insecurities by selling products that claim to “fix” what society deems as “flaws.” The pressure to fit in can exacerbate body image problems many girls have, and can lead them to engaging in unhealthy behaviors in order achieve an unattainable body ideal. Due to this, we have developed the Family Body Project (FBP), which is an experimental body acceptance and eating disorder prevention program in Oregon delivered virtually in English and Spanish for female-identified adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years-old and their caregivers. If you are considering participating, you will receive an initial 15-minute phone call to screen for eligibility. If you are eligible, we will proceed to scheduling an hour-long assessment that further examines body image concern. As this is an intervention study, eligible families will either be assigned to the control group or the intervention group. Participating families will be compensated for their time with gift cards, totaling $95 over the course of the study. Teen families living anywhere in Oregon are able to participate, so please share this if you believe you know a family, or families, to whom this may be of interest!

Potential participants can email Deanna Linville at linville@uoregon.edu, or leave a confidential voicemail at her office number: 541-346-0921. Potential Spanish-speaking participants should contact Celeste at cmenamor@uoregon.edu.",1630021804.0

Never thought I’d have the confidence to be admitting this publicly but over the last 2 years I’ve developed severe body confidence issues as a result of my breasts shrinking dramatically.

It started with just a slightly looser bra but it’s at the point now where I’m about the same size I was at 14 and stuffing my bra with socks and tissue to disguise what I’ve lost. I’ve even grown a full on 70’s bush just so I don’t look like a child when I see myself naked.

But after nearly 2 years of constant anxiety that someone might find out and feeling like I’m somehow worth less without my big boobs yesterday our postman saw me without my stuffed bra on (I wasn’t topless I just forgot to put the bra on under my tshirt before I answered the door!) and didn’t seem shocked and disgusted, nor did I feel embarassed. 

It’s a long way from accepting my new small breasts I know and it’s different to a close friend finding out etc but I think it’s a good first step :)",1629387925.0

How do I remain body positive when my boyfriend suggests I dress in clothes for a different body type?,45,p5v402,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/p5v402/how_do_i_remain_body_positive_when_my_boyfriend/,27,"We're both in our 20s. Will not break up, he is very sweet and none of this is done maliciously!

He always says I'm so cute that I should dress up more (which I want to!), but the things he always suggest just don't look flattering on me. I work out and am somewhat health conscious, but I know his type is very much petite in all areas while I'm very short waisted with a strawberry/apple shaped body (broad shoulders/ribcage, no hourglass). 

I've come SUCH a long way in loving my body over our 6 years together, but now that we've both become more confident, the things he's suggested I wear (when I ask and when I don't) just won't look good on me because I don't have the body that would look best with them.

The main things he suggests are low waisted bottoms (pants/skirts/shorts) and spaghetti strap tops, both of which look so awkward on me! Low waisted bottoms are already not great on their own imo, but with my short and wide waist it looks odd. My shoulders and chest being broad with thicker upper arms means thin strap tops just exaggerate how short and wide I am! 

Normally I could just brush it off, **it's not like he pushes them on me**, but I can't get it out of my head that I'm not his type. I know he loves me and thinks I'm pretty, but it's ever present in my mind that I'll never look the way he'd secretly want me to because, uhh, bones?",1629168198.0

I am worried my teenage cousin is developing body image issues because of the community she lives in. What can I do to help her?,46,p4jqgk,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/p4jqgk/i_am_worried_my_teenage_cousin_is_developing_body/,6,"Content warning: brief mention of disordered eating. 

She is 13. I’m 22F. 

Last I heard (my cousin was 12 at this point) her mom was trying  get her to eat less and work out to lose belly fat.

Now I hear she’s skipping a lot of meals. When I spoke to her about it she almost seemed to see it as a point of pride/an achievement that she doesn’t eat much.

I’m worried it’s going to affect her metabolism and overall health. I am also concerned that it’s going to/already has done a lot of damage to her self worth and mental health.

How can I help her build a healthy relationship with her body? 



To give some context:

In the country we come from immediate family, relatives, friends, teachers, neighbours and even strangers on the road will not hesitate to comment on your appearance. Especially weight. It can be brutal on your confidence. 

I went through it and now it breaks my heart to see she is going through it too.

To give you an example:

 I spoke to a relative I hadn’t heard from in years and the first thing she said to me was something to the effect of:

“So all you STILL do is eat huh?” 

Apparently she saw a photo somewhere.

With western media becoming more prominent in our country, the fatphobic beauty standard has only become more rampant in recent years. 

However, the body positive movement has not had the same level of influence. 

I don’t wanna be another person in her life telling her what to do with her body.But I have been where she is.So I at least want to her to know I’m there for her. And hopefully help her foster a healthy relationship with her body and self worth despite her environment making it hard.

But how do I go about that? 

Small but important detail; we live in different countries so our main form of communication is calls,texts and video chats.

I was searching reviews of ASOS because I’m interested to find some pretty sundresses from an European shop (no success so far) and I stumbled upon a video showing ASOS clothes irl. There was a girl trying clothes on and the comment section was filled with “she has my dream proportions”, “you have a perfect figure I want your body”, “ugh I wish I was born with her body” and that triggered and saddened me. 

I wish people would 1.realize you can’t make your body look a certain way because we all have different body types and structures and 2.it’s better to accept yourself than strive to be a certain body type especially when in most cases it’s unattainable 

I know I used to think this way too and looking back I realize that even if I had achieved my “dream” body I still wouldn’t have felt like it’s enough.

I’ve noticed a pattern in most general population type subreddits, such as WCGW or even ones like MadeMeSmile, that if the post includes a picture or video of a woman who is anything even slightly larger than a US size 4 somewhere near the top will be highly upvoted comments of people making fun of how “fat” she is. I, for some reason, cannot seem to stop myself from falling down the rabbit hole reading these comments. This compulsion exists for me everywhere I see it, it just seems to happen the most on Reddit. I am almost always bigger than the women in these pictures/videos typically are, and it’s having a really negative effect on my mental health as I work towards body acceptance/neutrality. I started working out and eating healthier a little while ago with the goal of general wellness rather than a set goal weight, but this has me backsliding into a more toxic diet culture fueled mindset.

I just wanted to rant. I’m thinking the healthiest thing for me would be to not read the comments or just avoid SM as much as possible.",1628517892.0

Getting Married in Three Days,17,oqge7a,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/oqge7a/getting_married_in_three_days/,8,"So I am getting married to my partner in three days, and I recently went out with some friends to celebrate, and of course, photos were taken, and as I reviewed the photos I could only say I became overwhelmed with hating how I looked in all of them. I kept comparing myself to my friends, as well to how I ""think"" I should look and I immediately stared to panic about the wedding day. We're having a very small thing, just city hall, parents, and a friend to take some photos, and I can't overcome feeling that all the photos will look horrible. Im so scared that I won't be able to handle the day or even look back on it with happy feelings... Hell honestly I'm just scared that how I see myself my partner will see me that way as well too, and be disgusted marrying/ being married to me. I feel so stupid venting like this but I just didn't want to sit with these feelings alone right now. I don't know what I am needing or expecting from posting this.

&#x200B;

I guess, its pretty normal to feel this way and want to look the perfect way for a special or even general day. Being overwhelmed is normal. I just needed to say what was happing in my head. Sorry for being super extra, and to those who read thank you for letting me vent.",1627090944.0
How to help a fatphobic partner on their journey,7,oq5121,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/oq5121/how_to_help_a_fatphobic_partner_on_their_journey/,6,"Hi everyone,  
I searched in the group but did not find another post that could help me, so if you know where go find it please direct me the right way! 
Some time ago my boyfriend raised the issue tht he thinks I am a bit too fat, I am an overweight woman, who has fought hard to accept her body, but still struggles with body image. 
When he spoke about how he thinks: 
I eat too much 
I am not healthy enough 
I have such a pretty face 
I am a  eight but if I was thin I would be beyond a ten. 

I don't need to tell you we almost broke up, I simply cannot afford to be with someone who thinks my insecurities are justified by how I look and that I should change cause I am not ok like I am. 
In addition, I think the thing that hurts me the most is that he kept on going back to the concept of ""health"" insisting on how his opinion was backed up by health concerns. 
To give you an example of how this is a little hypocritical: I am a smoker and he never insisted with the same strength on me quitting, because we love in a society where we would rather see someone  chain smoking than  healthy fat person. 

Anyway,  we talked for a long time, he seemed to understand my point of view, but I am afraid mostly because he just did not like seeing me hurt, I would like to be able to give him some source of information,  a book articles podcasts or anything really where he could hear it not only from me, where with more back up and scientific knowledge  someone could explain  to him my point of view. 

I also now struggle from time to time with more body image issuea than before, have the tendency to feel like I should loose weight  or exercise ""for him"". This of course creates a vicious circle where I almost abstain from those activities cause I associate them too much with negative thoughts  about my body and the idea of easing him instead of the healthy drive to go for  a run just because I want to feel my body alive and moving in all its functional and healthy rolls! 

Anyway thank you so much!",1627054926.0

Learning to accept crooked teeth,48,ooyv61,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ooyv61/learning_to_accept_crooked_teeth/,14,"I have what some call a ‘snaggletooth’ - it’s essentially a misaligned tooth. I believe it’s usually a top canine tooth that kind of protrudes out. Mine is pretty obvious and due to the lack of space in my mouth, I can’t really fully close my mouth. 

I’ve been teased since childhood and it’s made me extremely self conscious. Most people around me that have received dental and orthodontic work view it as a standard and accessible treatment and not a privilege. There is a lot of humor associated with bad teeth on tv or movies. I just want to disappear when something like that comes on screen when I’m with friends. 

I hate taking pictures - I’d rather be behind the camera. I contain my laughter and cover my mouth. I have lost ways to freely express joy and happiness. 

Does anyone have advice to work towards a confident smile knowing that dental and orthodontic work is out of reach for the moment? Or maybe ways to feel neutral about it and less embarrassed. TIA",1626901039.0

Looking for Advice on Body Acceptance After Medical Treatment and Sudden Change in Body Image,25,olymjl,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/olymjl/looking_for_advice_on_body_acceptance_after/,3,"Please let me know if this post goes against any rules - it's my first time posting here so I hope I understood the rules correctly: weight and body ACCEPTANCE advice :)

\[Warnings: Body Image, Weight Acceptance, Illness\]

So I suffer from a health condition which caused me to not absorb nutrients and calories and recently I got on a medicine which allows me to gain weight for the first time in a decade. And I am so happy, I feel more energetic and lively and my bloodwork has come back as healthy for the first time since my disease started.

The only issue is I'm kind of now battling with loving my new body (I love how I feel and the idea of gaining weight - it was always a fantasy to be healthy and to be able to make progress in certain activities I love like weightlifting) but I suppose I'm a bit insecure about a few things - mostly about how rapidly my body is changing now. For one because the medicine made me gain weight really quickly I developed a ton of stretchmarks which I never had before since I never really gained any weight even during puberty. I love stretchmarks on other people I think they're so beautiful but for some reason me getting them it's caused some body dysmorphia I suppose (mostly of how rapidly and how many I have gotten). I also am dealing with what the new me looks like. My family are very heavy in general (genetics) and I know I genetically have the chance of my normal weight being much higher than it was due to my disease. So I really want to learn how to accept that possibility if it happens.

I've partially accepted that and am even looking forward to being able to use my increased weight to create muscle once everything settles.

I guess if anyone has advice on loving a body that's changing rapidly I'd really appreciate it!

(I'm not looking to be changed, just want to accept my new body and be happy my disease is now in remission).

Didn't see a rule but might as well just add this in case: Male, he/him, 25, US.",1626501654.0
Dating with Body dysmorphia,28,olmimm,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/olmimm/dating_with_body_dysmorphia/,4,"
As the title and subreddit suggest, I have body dysmorphia. Actually, I haven’t been properly diagnoses, but my body and I do not have a good relationship. I don’t think the scale is my friend, but I can’t stop stepping on it. Anyways, I’m looking into getting a therapist because I used to have a neutral relationship with the way I look and I miss that. Here’s the thing, I recognize my anxieties about my body are probably all in my head, but I personally feel overweight. Like very overweight. I want to get back into dating, but my body anxieties keep coming to me. What if my partner sees my body the way I do? What if I’m just as grotesque to others as I am to myself? I’m wondering— how can I, or should I even, date with these inner demons? Besides my looks, I have confidence in myself (I love my personality and I am a very capable woman), but my body insecurities are far bigger right now than any confidence. I constantly catch myself thinking about different surgeries or things I want to change. Maybe I’m not ready to enter the dating game again with these thoughts. That’s okay, but how can I start to love myself again? :(",1626459060.0

Feeling insecure about my clubbed fingers. Need advice,18,okw8ul,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/okw8ul/feeling_insecure_about_my_clubbed_fingers_need/,3,"Hi.
So, I never actually put this type of insecurity in a ""spotlight"" but I have clubbed fingers on my hands and toes ever since I was born (usually it's associated with a disease but mine are just genetic. My fingers are somewhere in between Jeremy Renner and Mickey Rourke  type fingers).
The thing is- it never really ""bothered"" me in my life so much compared to other debilitating conditions but I do get kinda insecure sometimes about it and now is one of those times.

It's hard because I'm almost ""anticipating"" a time where it will become some sort of a ""problem"" and I'm struggling with juist accepting this. They don't look too bad but still. I look at them and I see a deformity.

Any advice on how to own this or not become so insecure about it will be great. I never really discussed this issue with anyone so I thought about turning to reddit.

as  one that struggled with his body and then studied and practice  phototherpay i feel obligated to spread the word. the fun part of the  whole technique is that you can pay and do it in a professional studio  etc. BUT you can also actually self practice !

Therapeutic Photography does not mean just only photo*taking*.    It also includes other photo-interactive activities with the  therapist or yourself.  such as photo-viewing, -posing, -planning etc.

it is scientifically based technique and i fully recommend it for anyone.  
Saying that, please remember we are in a digital era and in order to do everything safely try to keep your photos protected :)

I don't know who needs to hear this.,61,og9m65,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/og9m65/i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this/,11,"I've read alot of posts about people not being happy with their looks, and I always wonder ""why?"". Yes, you might not look like the ""perfect person"", doesn't matter if you are short, Tall, plus sized, skinny or whatever, you look beautiful.

All of these standards society has made up are just there to sell more products to people with low self esteem.

Do you want to live in a world where we all look alike? Men being these 6ft tall muscular, bearded beasts. And all women being these skinny and curvy goddesses?

Just because you don't look like the ""perfect person"" doesn't mean you need to change anything about your looks.

The ""perfect person"" doesn't exist. 
We are all equal, we are all the same.
We are just skin, muscle and fat.

It doesn't matter how you look. It matters how you act, how you are as a person.

I really frequently see women on here complaining about their breasts for example.
They often complain that their small or saggy or whatever, and? Who cares how your breasts look? Why see yourself like that? Yes you might not be happy with them, but im certain that people like **you** because of **you** and not because of your appearance.

Same goes for people on here who often say that they don't like their body hair. Body hair is natural. if you want to grow it out, grow it out.
If you want to shave it, shave it. You look beautiful whatever you do. Beauty doesn't come from the appearance, it comes from the heart.

And the posts I see the most is people talking about their weight. No matter if you are plus sized or skinny, does that make you less of a human just because of your body size? 
If you feel good in your body overall and don't have any complains (like hurting joints or whatever) you should focus on other things, more important things.

Acceptence, acceptence is something really important. Not only towards other people, but also towards yourself. It is difficult, I know I've been there. Just remember that whatever you look like, isn't that important. Yes, there are a few people who might judge you, and I guarntee that those people struggle with their own body image or some other issue.

Your body doesn't show your worth.

You people are amongst the nicest people I've seen on the internet, bringing other peoples confidence up. We are human, we should build each other up so they can build us up.

How to be confident in my very hairy legs,48,of2zu6,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/of2zu6/how_to_be_confident_in_my_very_hairy_legs/,41,"Basically I used to shave my legs regularly, but during quarantine last year, I decided to stop shaving in general because I realized I was doing it more out of obligation than doing it because I actually wanted to, so I let my leg hair grow out. I’m a hairy person in general so I grew a lot of leg hair, think super hairy guy leg lol. When it comes to my personal opinion, I appreciate my leg hair because I like to be natural, it makes me me, and affirms my gender identity (demigirl). But obviously I know not much people see it the way I do and it makes me feel like it’s me against the world. 

It’s summer now and whenever I go out, I never see any other girls with as much leg hair as me. Most have smooth, shiny, hair-free legs. I would love to wear shorts, skirts, and pretty dresses, but I know I stand out, and I can’t stand people looking at me like a freak. It makes me so angry that I can see guys with both hairy legs and shaven legs, but for girls, we don’t have that option without being seen as freaks. It’s so frustrating. 

Does anyone have any tips for being a bit more confident in their leg hair? Or can anyone relate to this?

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind comments and advice, I feel much more encouraged to be confident in my legs, even if just a little bit. This is kinda cheesy but I will hold them dear to my heart since it’s so hard to find this kind of support!

I'm a fat AFAB trans man and I haven't been to any doctor outside my university system since I started there. And even before then, I didn't have regular check-ups, I only went when I was really sick.

But now I'm in my mid-twenties and setting up primary care is important. I'm just really, really afraid that my new doctor is going to take one look at me and decide I'm awful.

I have neurodivergencies that make a diverse diet hard, but I eat the produce I can and I get regular exercise by walking.

I looked up clinics that have weight-neutral practices, but I still have anxiety! What do I say about my weight to a new doctor? How do I ask them to explore non-weight-related answers to my concerns?",1625251051.0

For those of us who are able to do some deliberate movement, it would be \*&\^%$#@! nice if I didn't have to go twelve places to find athletic wear that is made to fit a body like mine that wicks moisture, doesn't cut off circulation, and I feel comfortable being seen around people in. This really kicks in the body shame, and I hate it.

This happens with regular clothes too. Decent, affordable, plus-sized clothing takes a lot of effort. Thrift stores near me almost never have plus sizes.

I don't regret working out but I regret taking it too seriously and spending so much time in the gym. I still workout but my goal is to not get bigger. I feel I let the insecurity of not being man enough get to me. A man's strength isn't based on how big his muscles are. In the end you're still you big or small.

Carrying the Weights,42,o4t55n,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/o4t55n/carrying_the_weights/,2,"“Too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall, too anything. There’s a sense that we’re all ‘too’ something, and we are all not enough. This is life. Our bodies change. Our minds change. Our hearts change.”

\-Emma Stone

Ours is a society that elevates thinner bodies over heavier ones. Even thinner bodies have particular measurements that must fit societal standards, let alone heavier bodies. As a young girl, I have always noticed some anticipations created around female bodies; looks-wise, shape-wise, size-wise, color-wise, height-wise. Growing up in such a society with an established dimension for a female body has been very challenging. I had to continuously look down upon myself for not fitting to that standard. I accepted the societal norms as it was. My entire childhood was me being used for every other joke my friends could make, like, ""You're too small, I need a magnifying glass to see you."" I still remember my neighborhood aunty telling my mother that she would have looked nicer if she was a bit taller.

The shame women and girls experience at some point in their lives can have enduring and conceivably crippling impacts on their self-esteem. The statements below are some of the victims of body shaming, and I am sure you will see a little bit of yourself in each of the accounts.

""I was for a very long time stick-thin regardless of what I ate. All considered me puny until I started actively participating in sports. Breasts were the last thing that grew on me, and I, along with others, have had quite a laugh about it. Unlike me, my sister was fairer, stronger, curvier, and hourglass-shaped. For a long time, the comparison that came along held me back from trying to accept myself,"" says Supriya, a 21-year-old student.

""I still remember the day I had gone to one of my relative's houses. I had worn short pants, and my hairy legs were shamelessly showing. One of my relatives said that my legs did not look like a girl's legs. I felt so ashamed of myself. I could never accept my hairy legs and would always shave or wax them. Much later, I met a woman in Pondicherry who was not ashamed of showing her body hair in public. She could confidently wear shorts without waxing or shaving. That's when I realized if she can accept it, why can't I?"" Says a teacher named Samikhya.

Body positivity does not come easy. You have to remind yourself every day that you are a work of art and you are supposed to be different, from the way you look to the way you are. There's nothing called the perfect body. Ever visited a garden? Do you call the Dahlia ugly because it doesn't look like a rose? Then why do the same with women or even with yourself?",1624275635.0

And I read about a woman who goes to her DR and refuses to get on the scale. I’m considering doing this at my appt on Tuesday because I’ve gained A LOT of weight and I don’t want that number in my head or for that to be all my dr focuses on. 

Before I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I was always thin. But the pain is just too overwhelming for me now to get out and move the way I used to. I’m fat because I have fibro, it’s not that I have fibro because I’m fat.

So much progress made in body acceptance but I still feel like negative comments from others upset me so much!

I am someone in a semi-newly fat body. I've been trying to unlearn fat-phobia for a long time and I feel like the days of having negative comments and thoughts about myself are much better than they once were. HOWEVER, I have been struggling a lot with my environment and the people around me. 

For example, comments of others' weights or diets or body image problems really have been getting to me. Because I am objectively larger than so many of them, it hurts my feelings so much when they hate on their own body parts and fatness that are objectively a lot smaller than mine. I also hate hearing the comments of ""I'm going to turn into the garbage I eat"" type comments that people try to make sound funny. 

It often feels like the comments knock me off my track a little. I hate that it does. I would love to be fully unbothered and see it for what it is - their own insecurities and not a negative reflection of me. It isn't as easy as I wanted it to be though!

I wore a cropped tank top and shorts in public today!,152,o2gf0t,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/o2gf0t/i_wore_a_cropped_tank_top_and_shorts_in_public/,6,"So, I grew up being the “big girl” and during the summer months would wear sweaters and hoodies. I guess the reasoning was no one would be able to look at my body and judge me. I’ve always had a weird relationship with my body because of that but I’ve been working on it. Last summer, I wore shorts out in public which was something my younger self would never do. 

Well today, I was with some of my friends who are quite smaller than me. I trust these people and am very comfortable around them and since it was nearly 95(F), I was wearing the only crop top that I own. We were cooking and realized we were missing some things and needed to head to the store. We loaded into one of the cars and left. 

It wasn’t until we pulled into the parking lot that I realized that I didn’t have anything to cover myself with. Usually I keep a hoodie, jacket or even a oversized flannel in the back of my car for things like this but we didn’t take my car. And with it being so hot out, waiting in the car wasn’t a smart idea. So I decided that I just had to go with it. 

I quickly explained that I was a bit uncomfortable with going in, I was reassured that we will be in and out within 10 minutes and they would fight anyone who even looked in my direction. Like most of the shopping trips we take, 10 minutes turned into an hour and we brought more than we came for. I didn’t even realize it but I was simply enjoying myself with my friends. 

As soon as we left, everyone asked if that was okay and saying sorry for taking so long. It took me a second to think why I wouldn’t be okay. This was a few hours ago now but Im still very proud of myself and glad I have people to support me through my journey of  selfacceptance.",1623989912.0

Has anyone here had breast asymmetry correction surgery?,13,o1kurf,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/o1kurf/has_anyone_here_had_breast_asymmetry_correction/,14,"Hello, I am a 24 year old female and have had pretty asymmetrical breasts since puberty- so was born with it. 

I don’t want to get into the dramatics of it but it has definitely caused me a slew of mental health issues regarding my body image and overall self-esteem.

I have worked really hard to move past those issues and can truly say I love my body now. I have a wonderful partner who thinks I’m perfect that I’ve been with the past 6 years. So I’m not looking into this surgery to bring me love or self-esteem. 

But honestly it is a pain in the ass to constantly have to hide them in clothing and find bras that fit. Swimsuits are annoying. 

I am pretty large chested so it’s really not that noticeable with clothing on, but it’s more of a hassle than anything and occupies more of my mental space than I’d like to admit and that I would gladly clear out for deeper more meaningful things and I think surgery would be really gift me that. 

I am located in the Southern California area and found a surgeon who specializes in it, his before and afters are very impressive for my specific issue. 

The surgery quote is expensive like 12-17k so I need time to save. 

But am wondering about anyone else’s experience with this procedure, advice, recommendations, etc. 

Also if you are happy you had it and how it has positively impacted your life.

There is a person at my job that constantly comments on how little they eat, how they shouldn’t snack on things, how they feel so sick because they haven’t eaten etc. This person knows I struggle with an eating disorder and I wish there was a way I could find a good source that shows how bad it is to make these comments in front of someone with an eating disorder.

Whenever i look at myself i cannot compare anyone to my body type, like i see peoples body and i think every single person looks amazing and no one looks like me.

Why I will never be a size 0,53,nv84oj,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/nv84oj/why_i_will_never_be_a_size_0/,14,"All my life I’ve compared the way my body looked to other the way people looked. I wanted to be skinny, have a thigh gap, have a flat stomach all the time, and fit into the tinniest clothes. However, I will never be a size 0. It’s not because I don’t “want it bad enough” like some people have suggested, but rather it’s because my body isn’t built for that. I don’t have a small frame; my shoulders are build like a football player, and my hip bones are so many inches larger than my waist. I will never fit in a size small because my body just isn’t made for it. But just because I know I will never look like some girls doesn’t stop me from wishing I did. There are so many times when I’m at the gym, or the pool, or even work where I look at a girl who’s petite and wished I looked like her. 

I did some horrible things to my body along the way to where I am now, and I’m not proud of them at all. I’m not going to lie, I still have thoughts to do those horrific things to myself, but accepting that I will never look like someone else, because nobody else is me, had made things just a little bit easier.",1623169690.0

I’m sorry. From the bottom of my heart. I’m honestly embarrassed and ashamed at how much contempt I’ve had for you my whole life. I want to get into that, and address that, but first I want to apologize.

I’ve learned so much about our relationship this past year. I’ve been able to appreciate you through a whole new lens and I honestly can’t believe the amount of love that has come from this understanding. 

I *always* blamed you. Unfairly, obviously. But you were the scapegoat, the reason for my appearance issues. The reason my confidence was held back and the reason I called myself all sorts of awful things. I had patience and understanding for other parts of my body, but never you. Too big, too much cellulite, too many stretch marks. In my mind there were so many justifiable reasons to not only be angry at you but to be downright mean. And for that I am so, so sorry. 

But now, I see you for what you are. A marvel of the human body. Something that is capable of incredible feats of strength and beautiful expressions of art (sometimes simultaneously!) Already you’ve taken me to the tops of mountains, you’ve powered me through lakes, rivers, and oceans, and you’ve shown me around some of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Tears have been shed on you, broken hearts have been comforted on you, and I don’t even know how many times claws have poked or scratched you and you’ve still remained a warm and cozy bed for a furry friend. You get me through the boring stuff too, the day-to-day slough of it all. Nearly always without so much as a “thank you” or a little show of gratitude. You’ve never let me down.

So from here on out, I promise to cherish you. To always love and appreciate you. To stick up for you and to never take you for granted again. 

I love you and I am so, so proud of you. 


***



Context for this letter:

This sounds a little strange but my thighs have always “ran hot.” As in, they flush at times. Blood rushes to the fronts of my thighs and they will almost pulse with increased blood flow. 

I first noticed it in elementary school and have tried to compare my thighs to my peers all throughout my life at different stages. In similar situations, my friend’s thighs would never really “run hot” like mine do. 

Now, you can write off this part as ~hippy woo woo~ stuff, but I’m a believer the concept of “energy” and “energy healing.” I’m certainly not saying that there is any one right way of going about interpreting or practicing things like that, but I do believe in listening to your body.

So when I decided to stop and listen to my body, what I found was an enormous amount of shame directed at my thighs. I’m talking go get a forklift amount of shame. It honestly caught me off guard a bit. I scratched at the surface of these feelings and found that a lot of it was rooted in society’s conditioning. Nowadays, it’s become slightly easier as “thicc” has become the new black. But growing up - if you were a girl and you weren’t blonde and skinny, you might as well have been invisible. I had so much resentment towards myself for not fitting those requirements. *So much* emphasis was placed solely on appearances. 

My change in self-acceptance came when I reframed my metric of self-worth. It is SO unfair to judge yourself against the airbrushed, enhanced, and edited content that blares in front of us wherever there’s media. It’s fake. From top to bottom, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. So instead, take pride in your body’s abilities. Love your body for what it’s capable of, not for how it looks compared to literal propaganda that doesn’t exist without extensive amounts of beauty products and photoshop. 

Self-acceptance is a difficult process for nearly everyone struggling to fit in when they don’t measure up to conventional standards. And with this realization I’m not declaring myself “cured” (although my thighs very rarely “run hot” anymore!), I just now have the perspective to make these issues more manageable. I wanted to include this because I want other people to realize that this kind of problem is one that doesn’t just disappear overnight. Yes, I’ve made leaps and bounds of progress, but there are still good days and bad days. 

Also, the last thing I want is for people to think that this piece is rooted in ableism. I can only imagine the struggles that people who are handicapable go through when it comes to their bodies. I myself have a genetic deformity, it’s not on display constantly, but there are certainly unique struggles that come along with something like that. I still believe that there are ways to appreciate your body for what it is and the ways that it carries you through life. Regardless of its limits or diagnoses, you’re here, you’re breathing, you’re experiencing life, you’re beautiful. 

So please, be easy on yourself. You are a marvel of human evolution and you should appreciate yourself for the insanely impressive things that you’re capable of, be it with your mind, body, or soul.",1622127683.0

Finding a body neutral/positive doctor and/or exercise experience?,3,nlmpxq,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/nlmpxq/finding_a_body_neutralpositive_doctor_andor/,2,"Hey all- I’m in need of a new primary care physician and am also hoping to find an in-person yoga class in my area. My biggest concern for both of these things is finding someone/place that is body positive/neutral (or at least will respect me as a fat person and the fact that I do not want to change my weight) and willing to make accommodations (in the case of yoga).

I know there are multiple websites and lists of fitness instructors as well as doctors who are HAES approved and/or body positive but none of them are within 3 hours of my area. I am wondering if anyone has found any “tells” that a physician or fitness instructor is accepting in this way. Does anyone have a template of an email and/or conversation they’ve had with these professionals to find out? Even just some questions you’ve asked would be very helpful. 

Side note: I know there is lots of great online body neutral/positive yoga instruction but I’m hoping to find an in person class to get corrections on what I’m doing. Yoga brings me a lot of joy, but I’m concerned about injuring myself by doing it incorrectly. ❤️ That said, feel free to drop any plus size/body pos online yoga instructors in the comments if you have them- I’d love to look into them.",1622050628.0

is this sexist or am i just overthinking?,66,nc46f1,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/nc46f1/is_this_sexist_or_am_i_just_overthinking/,23,"women in general have harsher standards than men, and beauty is very minimal. on tiktok mostly, but on social media whenever a female has an hourglass figure that is plus size, which is a pretty figure just like others, they're always praised on. but when it comes to someone else who is plus size and doesn't have that figure, they're made fun of and called cringy.

now getting into the basics, what mostly causes more women to have a pear or hourglass shape, or simply distributing fat to your thighs, butt, and boobs, is estrogen! you can work out, yes, but for people who have it naturally, estrogen levels will make you gain more weight in those areas making you more attractive as a plus size person, according to society.

i have low estrogen levels and have had more testosterone since i was 12, around the middle of puberty. i never grew up with boobs, all my fat was distributed anywhere else, i didn't really have a big butt or bug thighs. i was and still am plus size, but not the attractive one mostly due to my abnormal hormone levels. if i had more estrogen, i would've maybe had a better appearance.

now i accept myself, but why can't society praise women who don't have such high estrogen levels. women are degraded if they have facial hair, if they don't have an hourglass, if they're bigger, etc. but if women have normal estrogen, which is typically normal, they're always praised.

is this sexist tho?",1620983187.0

I'm kinda skinny. I have no muscle on my body, but I also just have no fat to cover the natural muscle. I'm not like *bony* skinny but you know... I can't gain much weight, and I do have lil abs. I have a genetic unevenness in my chest muscles that I normally hide well. Lastly, due to a lil shyness of my own, no one rlly sees me without a shirt on (other than immidiate fam). I am confident in my body tho 


Normally when ppl rlly see my skinniness, they will have one of four responses. 


1.) A compliment

2.) Passive aggressive/backhanded compliment

3.) An insult

4.) a compliment followed by immense self deprication


I don't mind 1, 2, or 3, but 4 is what bothers me. A friend of mine (been friends for a while) recently saw a picture of me that I didn't have a shirt on in. Their response was ""Omg your so fit, I wish I had your body, I'm so fat, I need to lose weight."" 


I don't know what to say to that. As much as I want to help, I don't know how. If I feel comfy, I normally show the unevenness of my pectoral muscles to prove that no bodies are ""perfect,"" but that never helps much. I like helping people, I like giving advice, but idk what to do. 


Someone recently asked for weight loss tips and exercises. I told them I don't gain weight, and never had to really work for the body I do have; I don't know because I never had to know. 


So what I'm asking is, what do I say in these situations? If you were them what would you want to hear? How do I help them? *without sounding condescending*


TLDR; People come to a skinny dude who has never needed to work for weight loss for tips and advice. See questions above. 

I'm rlly bad at explaining things, so hopefully this makes sense. If u have any questions or need clarification, lmk.",1620766641.0

I (Female, 19) live in China and have been living in China for about half a decade. I’ve spent a vast majority of my later teens here and being someone from South-East Asia, I feel extremely different from everyone here. I know from Western media and representation that I’m not at all a big person, I’m more medium sized. I have very wide hips, thick thighs and a big lower back, with a straight but proportionally small torso, a fairly wide and bony chest and torso, but big upper arms and small boobs. Everyone here is tiny in both height and weight and they are fairly petite and flat (in a good way) but still have fairly curved torsos. I know it sounds stupid knowing my dimensions but I feel so fat and burly and tall and large when I’m walking around everyone else. I feel like I only look good in clothes that accentuates my figure but I feel like I’m being overly promiscuous when I’m just trying to go about my daily life. For example, in high school, I would get dress coded for wearing the same length dress as some of my other classmates because it would look more provocative on me. I feel like I can’t ever look sophisticated and girly and small. I feel like I look so big and gross next to my guy friends, I can never just be petite and cute and elegant. I feel so terrible all the time because I know that, even if I lose weight, I’ll always have a bigger lower body that will prevent me from looking sophisticated. I guess the biggest issue is that when I try to buy clothes, the dimensions are never right for me. Clothes always fit so awkwardly on me because I’m not the typical consumer here. I always find myself buying XXL clothes just so that they will fit my thighs and hips. I guess I just don’t know how to dress myself, really. Does anyone have any tips?

When I search online for ""benefits of the inverted triangle shape"" or ""reasons to love the inverted triangle body shape"" I come up with more articles and guides on how to appear more like an hourglass! What in the heck! 

So, I'm here to start a thread of inverted triangle appreciation. What do you love about your body type?

I'll start us off - I love that my broad shoulders give off a ""boss bitch"" vibe - when people see me they immediately consider me to be strong internally. People also often see me as taller than I am due to the way I carry myself.",1619373369.0

Body perception/acceptance exercise - I love this,40,my9efp,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/my9efp/body_perceptionacceptance_exercise_i_love_this/,13,"[https://cleanfooddirtygirl.com/take-your-head-out-of-it-and-allow-your-body-to-be-like-a-tree-chilled-cucumber-chive-soup/](https://cleanfooddirtygirl.com/take-your-head-out-of-it-and-allow-your-body-to-be-like-a-tree-chilled-cucumber-chive-soup/)

I love this. It's like practicing the Buddhist concept of equanimity but with our own body.

&#x200B;

From the article:

Want to try something different?

Go outside and find a tree, any tree will work. Then, just notice it. Look. Don’t question or judge the tree. Accept it for exactly how it is. Maybe it gives you shade. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe it grows food. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe its branches are long, maybe they are shorter. Maybe there are birds in it. Maybe it holds a swing for your kiddo. Maybe it’s old. Maybe it’s brand new. It doesn’t matter. Let it be whatever tree it is without attaching anything to it or judging it.

Give that tree five minutes of your undivided attention, and then give it gratitude for the very simple reason that it is here.

**Do not read on until you’ve gone outside and looked at the tree for at least five minutes.** 

*Did you notice how the tree didn’t over complicate stuff?*

It stood there, being a tree. It was exactly where it needed to be, doing its job brilliantly. It didn’t beat itself up, trying to be something it isn’t. It was unapologetic and steadfast in its reality of being a tree.

For whatever reason, that tree is part of this world in this particular moment in time.

**And it is perfect.**

Ready for part two?

Go into your bathroom or bedroom, shut the door, get naked and look at your body in the mirror. Just notice it. Look. Don’t question or judge. [Accept it for exactly how it is](https://cleanfooddirtygirl.com/accept-your-gorgeous-body-exactly-as-it-is-right-now-plus-whole-food-plant-based-banana-walnut-muffins/). Maybe it’s pink. Maybe it’s brown. Maybe it’s black. Maybe it has curves. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe there are stretch marks, scars and birthmarks. Maybe it’s smooth. Maybe it has sags and dimples and wrinkles. It doesn’t matter. Let it be your body without attaching anything to it or judging it.

Give your reflection five minutes of your undivided attention, and then give it gratitude for the very simple reason that it is here.

**Do not read on until you’ve looked at your body in the mirror for at least five minutes.** 

*Did you notice how your body didn’t over complicate stuff? Your thoughts might have, but your body didn’t.* 

It stood there, being your body. It was exactly where it needed to be, doing its job brilliantly. It didn’t beat itself up trying try to be something it isn’t. It was unapologetic and steadfast in its reality of being your body.

For whatever reason, your body is part of this world in this particular moment in time.

**And it is perfect.**

Allow your body to be like the tree. Let it do its job, unapologetically. With grace and perfect imperfection.",1619360926.0

Currently I'm dating guy, who is shorter and leaner than me.
We've been seeing each other for about two months now, but already heard some mean comments from people since we're quite atypical pair (eg. They are assuming that we are together because: him short, me fat, nobody else wanted to date us)
Height of my partner is not a problem for me at all, however I've been struggling with my plus-size body acceptance since I can remember, and I'm already 30 now.

Do you have any experiences with being in not really stereotypical, if we talk about bodies, relationship?
How do you deal with such a mean comments in everyday life? I know it's not worthy to listen to them, but in reality it's really hard.

So i used to be a professional roller skater.I started skating at the age of 13 and absolutely loved it and still do but my coach always thought of me as fat and a failure and also always compared my body shape to other kids at the class and it made me feel sad but just because i loved to skate I never let it bother me, also I remembered he once called me a loser through cheering stands in a championship and I took it okay back then...fast forward.. I left skating at 15 because my grades were dropping and I wouldn’t win any championship so i dropped out but now that i think of it,it kills me to think that how could a coach call their students such stuff and it still makes me cry of how everyone made fun of me bcoz of my body. During lockdown I constantly kept thinking of how he and my so called friends at my skating class treated me and developed eating disorder and i just kept tracking my calorie intake and gave up everything i liked ti eat bcoz it had more calories. Few days ago I deleted my calorie calculator and looked at my body in the mirror and cried for 30 min on how much i hated it even after so much efforts and today’s finally after days I started to like my body not completely but getting rn the best feature of my body is my jiggly stomach 😌 I just wanna say is that if you have kids who train or coaches like this please stand up to them because it took away my complete confidence and self worth and it also made me quit that one sport i loved",1618861276.0

having a hard time clothes shopping,30,mth99k,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/mth99k/having_a_hard_time_clothes_shopping/,9,"for the fellow uk members, as you know clothing retail opened again last week. i’ve just started a new job with a smart dress code and i barely had anything to wear (never worked in an office before until now). so yesterday i go to primark to get some clothes for work and i was pretty happy with what i got (2 skirts, 2 pairs of trousers, 2 shirts and a dress) but when i got home, only one skirt fit me. i’m not too fussed as i forgot i always have to go a size up in primark (i’m a size 16). so i go back today to exchange everything for a size 18 and the dress, one pair of trousers and shirts still don’t fit!!!! 

even the things that do fit are still somewhat ill fitting!!!! it’s driving me mad!! on top of the fact that you can’t try things on at the moment, i’m driving back and forth!! i know that primark clothes are not exactly the best quality so i know the sizes are hit and miss but honestly in general, it is so rare to find well fitting clothes as a woman. dressing for a woman’s body is so difficult. my boyfriend fits into literally everything he buys it’s ridiculous.

Tall girl tired of being told I’m tall,18,mkcr5t,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/mkcr5t/tall_girl_tired_of_being_told_im_tall/,13,"I’m (24F) 5’ 10” - I’m no professional athlete, but obviously I’m on the taller side and I have more of an athletic build. I’m not model skinny. I’ve got thicker thighs, a big butt, and broad shoulders. Since high school, I thought I was, in general, fairly confident about being a tall woman. I used to love the way it made me feel powerful and gave me a high vantage point in crowds. I don’t (anymore) feel threatened by the crowd of men who are obsessed with short girls. I thought I had become so resiliently secure about my height, that I’m surprised to find recently I’ve been so annoyed and at times almost hurt by frequent comments about my height. 

I think the recent comments have stemmed from the fact that I’ve met some people over Zoom in the last year (like coworkers and some people in a church community group), and upon meeting them in person for the first time, their initial (not ill-intentioned) comment is something along the lines of “WOW I had no idea you were so tall!” It’s just awkward for one thing, like how am I supposed to respond to that? “Yep, I’m a tall girl!”?? I don’t typically comment on someone’s appearance unless I’m complimenting their outfit, so it’s just a strange phenomenon to me that people feel comfortable saying such a thing. Like honestly, what response do they expect? I even had a coworker (very petite female) say “I don’t even understand how you find pants that fit.” I just wanted to say “Well, I’ve been shopping for pants for my body for the last 10 years so I’m pretty good at it,” but I always just end up laughing these things off or playing along like “oh girl it’s a struggle!” because I don’t want to be rude. It’s gotten to the point where when I see people for the first time who’ve previously only known me on the phone, I just KNOW they are sizing me up and overcome by an impression about my height. 

I think this has started to mess with my security and body-image, because apparently my height and stature is such a noticeable thing that people immediately feel the need to draw attention to it. For the most part it is rightly socially unacceptable to comment on someone’s weight in western cultures, so why is it fair game to bring up someone’s height? Aside from my coworkers and church people, my roommates have frequently commented on my height, as well as my friends, every guy I’ve ever been on a date with, random people in the grocery store, etc etc. Does anyone else relate, and how should I respond in these situations?? And how can I get over the way these interactions make me feel about myself? Maybe I’m overly sensitive?!",1617597513.0

Confused??,23,mjkkc3,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/mjkkc3/confused/,11,"Hi! I’ve never posted on Reddit before I mainly go on here to browse around random scary story stuff but I’ve been struggling a bit with something that’s been a bit confusing. I’m 16, turning 17 soon (I didn’t see any rules about age but if it missed it my apologies) and I struggle a lot with my body image when I’m around my mother, she likes to point things out to my face but recently she keeps bombarding me with comments telling me I have a ‘flat ass’ or ‘no ass’ and then makes fun of me for it! Types of comments like these are common with her I remember once in the 6th grade she told me my little sister was going to have bigger boobs then me (I’m not really sure why that matters when you’re in the 6th grade). This isn’t an isolated situation either, she has been commenting on my body since middle school and likes to tease me and use words referring to my body that she knows I don’t like, normal bodily functions like periods are a huge embarrassment due to how she has treated me in the past regarding them and now I can’t ask for help about it and can barely even tell my dad (I live with him) or talk to her when I need any of those products! Things like that are a huge embarrassment to me now and I hate it

I just wanted to reach out and express my confusion and frustrations to see if anyone had any advice how to handle this or had gone through something similar, once again this is my first time posting anything on Reddit and I’m just extremely frustrated with how my mother treats my body compared to my sisters. Thank you to anyone who may read this or comment on this I’m just at my wits end",1617494457.0

Body Acceptance Songs? Melon Cake- Demi Lovato,7,mj2r07,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/mj2r07/body_acceptance_songs_melon_cake_demi_lovato/,2,"Not sure if any of you like pop music, but Demi had a new album come out lastnight in which she sings candidly about her struggles with mental health, drug addiction, and body image. This song “melon cake”[Melon Cake](https://youtu.be/jq9719LKw0w) is a certified bop in my book. It’s a huge FU to dieting and restricting and learning to love yourself again at every stage. I was curious what other body acceptance songs you all listen to?


A little background on the song if anyone is interested: In 2018, Demi posted a photo of her birthday cake, which was a watermelon covered in fat free whip frosting. In this song she blatantly says:
“And now I'm sayin' no more melon cakеs on birthdays. No more barricades in doorways. Finally get to do things my way” She also has another line: “Dear little me, I'm sorry that it took so long. But baby, you're free”
I love this line because it reminds me of how badly I wanted to love myself as a child, and now that I finally do I want to give her a huge hug. Anyways, have a listen if you enjoy catchy pop music!",1617430196.0

Dear teen trying to get that perfect body:,34,mhwup7,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/mhwup7/dear_teen_trying_to_get_that_perfect_body/,4,"Have you tried counting calories? The keto diet? How about working out more? Have you tried skipping breakfast, that is always a winner. Look at how skinny your friend got this spring, don’t you wish that was you? What are we doing? All of this is pointless, so just put on a big sweatshirt and call it good.

So much of my time used to be spent counting calories and working out until I physically couldn’t anymore. There were times I would even work out on an empty stomach, resulting in sharp pains that took me to the floor, where I would lay for minutes at a time trying to grasp onto consciousness. My muscles were almost always in pain, my stomach was almost always empty.

I was conditioned to think that it would help me get the body I needed…wanted, as I was a little more “heavy-set” back then. My grandmother had pounded words into my head that ultimately led to eating disorder after eating disorder. I am *still* in recovery. My mom *still* has to scribble out the nutritional facts on food so that I’ll eat it without such a large amount of guilt that my chest gets tight. My grandma *still* makes comments. It is one of the hardest processes I have ever been through. And for what? Society’s image of a perfect body?

**No thanks.**

Like you, I so wish that I didn’t care. I so wish that my grandmother—and yours-- didn’t ask:

“Are you really going to eat all that?”

“Didn’t you already have some of that earlier?”

“Weight Watchers said…”

Maybe I shouldn’t have eaten it. Maybe I should have followed grandmother’s flawed system of calorie counting.

**Maybe I should have listened.**

The thing is, though, nothing ever changed. Had I listened or not, It is all a mental game.

So there you are, looking at yourself in the mirror, hating what you see. I’ve been there. It sucks.

While you were focusing on how imperfect you are, your body kept you alive.

Do you ever think about how crazy that is? All that your body can do? Your body has grown with you, been broken and rebuilt itself, carried you as far as you desire to go. It is a machine, and it is your own. 

So, why are you so worried about how it looks?

You are your worst critic, and there is absolutely no reason for you to be. Every detail, whether it be considered a flaw or not, is unique to you. The way the corners of your eyes crease when you smile, the snort that slips out when you are caught up in laughter, the freckles cover you from head to toe, even the scars you have from the scooter accidents as a child. It is not all about your size, because I can put money on the fact that people never worry about your weight when the room is being lit up by that gorgeous smile of yours. You are built exactly how you are supposed to be, in all of your glory. 

If Jessica from third period doesn’t like the way you look, that is her problem.

If that boy you have a crush on thinks you aren’t an absolute goddess, he for sure wouldn’t be good enough to chase after anyway.

Start living your life for yourself. Do what makes you happy.

Eat what you want. Don’t count those calories. Don’t restrict yourself from your favorite foods. Work out as much as you are comfortable with or not at all.

And above all else, NEVER skip breakfast.

You and all the beautiful uniqueness of your being are worthy of all the love in the world. 

Dear teen trying to get that perfect body:

Stop. **You already have it.**",1617288347.0

I always thought I was too fat. It was never perfect enough. I listened to people make negative comments about my body and I believed them. I had it in my head that everything about my body was wrong and that I was a failure because it wasn’t perfect. 

Now I am looking back at pictures of myself, and realizing that I looked great. Why did I listen to them? Why didn’t I know that I looked fine? 

And now I really am very overweight, and going through menopause and some medical issues. And I know it really doesn’t matter that I am fat. My husband loves me, I have a good job, and great friends and family  

So I am beginning my journey of acceptance. No more thinking about diets and longing for a lithe body; I am going to buy clothes that fit instead of wearing ones that I think I should be able to wear.

F The Scales,35,m7qoxq,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/m7qoxq/f_the_scales/,21,"I had to get weighed today for an appointment. We alllll dread this. Mostly because society tells us as women to be 115 pounds or less. Also, we are in a pandemic and everyone has gained weight in some sense. Obviously working out is not a priority. I know I have gained weight but fortunately my clothes still fit and I don't believe I look that different than from before. Even if I did gain, so what. This time is extremely tough! I try to eat well and exercise a normal amount in order to take care of myself and body. To feel strong and have some energy. NOT for what society tells us we should look like but for how I want to feel and look. I do my best not to look at the scale because it does me no good and I obsess over the numbers. I tried to do that today but my curiosity got the best and I looked. I was shocked. It made no sense. The amount would deem that I would have had to go up a size or two in clothes. That I would look completely different than what I actually do. Of course, I started getting sad and beating myself up. Then, I had a moment of clarity. Scales are absolutely BS! A number does not define what my body looks like or who I am as a person! It does not define my beauty or my values. It does not define my character. Actually, that number doesn't define if I am fat, skinny, muscular etc. It is just an NUMBER! And a number that is irrelevant. I was livid at the fact that we have been conditioned to be so focused on this number when each body is different! Two people can weigh the exact same size and look completely different. I hate that we have been so consumed by weighing a certain amount and people have starved themselves to fit that way. Trust me, I did it too. I am not an expert in this but I wanted to share my thoughts on this topic because maybe someone else needs to hear it today.

Something I wrote,62,m03bty,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/m03bty/something_i_wrote/,7,"
I decided to love my body  

Not because I looked like the goddess you see in paintings  

Or the girls on the covers of magazines  

But because my body loved me  
And I wanted to love it back  

It kept working  

When I overate  
under-ate  
Or didn’t get much sleep  

Or hurt it, in some kind of way  

It kept working for me  
For a reason beyond my understanding  

My lungs, kidneys, stomach, my heart and my brain  

And even though I may not know the reasons  
I hope I can return the favor one day  

I decided to love my body  
I decided to love me

I’m I overthinking things?,20,lz2yyl,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/lz2yyl/im_i_overthinking_things/,8,"Lately I’ve been thinking about the past and I suddenly remembered something and it was when I went to a this bar and restaurant with my two friends. 

There was a big screen on the wall showing a hockey match and there were people behind us watching it. Me and my friends were expats and so we kind of stood out with our accents. 

I was a bit uncomfortable and thought they were staying at us and I kept turning around to see how many people were behind us as I struggle with anxiety. 

As me and my friends were talking I heard a man saying ‘she looks masculine’ this really stung as I have been called a man because I thought have a overly feminine body and I just realize it could have been my nose. I have a hooked nose and I have a fat head and a forehead that is strong and kind of sticks out. 

So I’m thinking it was because of that. Then I was thinking were they talking about my friend who doesn’t have a overly feminine face but her features are softer than mine so I don’t know it kind of hurt me because you start to doubt yourself and wonder does everyone think like this and I have to keep reminding myself that no not everyone thinks like this and it is only a few opinions of others.

I’m trying to forget about this but it hurts it really does.",1615041875.0

Personal challenge: express appreciation and admiration instead of judgement or jealousy.,39,lwx98r,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/lwx98r/personal_challenge_express_appreciation_and/,11,"I have been struggling for the past few years with my body image and weight gain during COVID. As a result I find that this is becoming a strain on my relationship.

We live in a college town where women outnumber men 6:1. They seem to all be the beauty standard: tall, blonde, white and thin. There’s nothing wrong with fitting into these categories, I am just struggling with finding my body acceptance amidst it. As a result, when my BF and I are out in public I’ll start to shut down and become a bit overwhelmed with anxiety and too focused on whether or not he is checking them out. It’s so exhausting for both of us. 

So I’m going to challenge myself to compliment these women right out the gate for 30 days. Instead of being intimidated and jealous, I’m going to lean in and acknowledge their beauty and see if I feel any different about my own at the end. Check my ego and let go. 

Anyone interested in doing the challenge with me?",1614787269.0
Trying to appreciate my weight gain,46,lwi9fa,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/lwi9fa/trying_to_appreciate_my_weight_gain/,10,"First time posting here, and I'm a little nervous.

I've suffered a lot of mental illness in my life, and for the past 6 years or so my disorders and the meds used to treat them made it difficult for me to get enough to eat. There were times I got so thin I didn't recognize myself in photos.

A few months ago I started a new medication, and it has helped me so much. My sleep, my mood, my relationships, my focus, EVERYTHING has improved so much, including my appetite and digestion. I am so grateful to have made it out of 2020 alive, and I have a lot of hope that things will only continue to get better for me in my mental health journey.

But I've gained like 50lbs on this new medication. Even though the people in my life would never say anything disparaging about my weight gain, I grew up in a really fatphobic household and have been working ever since to undo all those years of toxic messages. So the only judgement I've faced about my weight is coming from inside my own head, but there's a good deal of it.

I guess I'm just posting here to affirm to myself that my health matters so much more than my dress size, and to hopefully receive a little validation too. I try to think of my weight gain as a side effect of recovery, and to remind myself that being overweight and well is so much better for me than being skinny, sad, and starved. But it's easier said than done.

Any support is welcome. Thanks for reading.",1614736231.0

Imposter syndrome for being attractive,41,ltxdh9,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ltxdh9/imposter_syndrome_for_being_attractive/,8,"Hello I wanted to know if anyone else feels this way and if there is any advice on how I can fix this issue :). 
I find myself dressing myself down a lot and making my self look like a bag lady ( what i mean is I’ll wear super loose clothing that doesn’t match at all) bc I am uncomfortable with looking “too good.” Or i won’t do my hair or makeup because ill convince myself that if i do it I am being fake and that isnt myself and i am being extra and everyone can see through that.
It is this weird insecurity I picked up I dont know why or from where (i mean i have been dealing with depression/ anxiety the past 5 years that but i am starting to get so much better) and I have recently just realized how much it effects me. Sometimes when I dress up and I am feeling myself ill get a compliment (mostly from my sister and i dont know why from her it effects me so much) and she will say things like “ woooow u look so tiny” but it feels so fake and it makes me feel like I have to explain oh no i don’t actually look like this I spend like an hour on my makeup and hair and i was wearing this outfit in a way to hide how big i really look. And after comments like that ill notice myself start to slouch and want to hide.
   I am taller for a girl so i take up a lot of space and all my friends are at least 5” shorter than me so i stick out like a sore thumb and i get so uncomfortable. 
  I have been trying to better my self lately and have been working out a lot and am starting to get definition on my tummy and i want to be more confident in my skin but i almost feel like i need to explain myself when i look good ( i hope that makes sense).

Body Acceptance.... Unless you’re a tall woman,19,lrtrcv,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/lrtrcv/body_acceptance_unless_youre_a_tall_woman/,7,"I am very tall. This is just a fact of life. No one is debating it. In fact, people stop me in the streets to exclaim and make known to me just how tall I am. At 6’2, I am a spectacle to behold as I reach for the cereal on the top shelf at the grocery store. People of all ages and stages stop to admire how “exotic” and “Amazonian” I am throughout my day. Every. Single. Day.

This is even more so true when I walk around with my husband. He’s about 2 inches shorter than me. “You’re so brave, I could never date a man who isn’t at least 3 inches taller than me.” That is what 95% of women have to say to me about it. If you are reading this and you have a vagina, please don’t deny it. You’re probably one of them. 

It’s 2021. Please stop the backhanded compliments about how tall I am compared to my soul mate, and please stop being so ridiculously shallow. I already have to buy all my pants and shoes online. I have to live with the trauma forever of a short 40-year-old man telling me “I’d like to climb you like a tree” when I was 14 years old.

I started to be more confident!!,52,lpc6ds,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/lpc6ds/i_started_to_be_more_confident/,4,"Some time ago i posted here about my SO being ashamed with me (you can check out the post on my profile if you want). Welp, i remember saying in the comments that I'd give him a second chance and whatnot, but I decided to listen to my gut feeling and to y'alls advice, so i ended it with that mf. If only it was that easy tho... It was a very...weird relationship. Close to the end of it, he started saying very hurtful things like ""I'm ashamed to go out with you"", ""my mom doesn't like you because you're fat"" (this leading up to him treating me like a piece of shit for too long), ""you should go on a diet or else blablabla"" etc etc, you get the jizz. 
Those things hurt me REALLY bad, because it was the first time i made myself vulnerable in front of someone, the first time i said ""fuck it"" and showed myself (both body and mind) just the way i am. The whole period before breaking up, my confidence was brought to the ground, i was miserable. I hated myself, i couldn't stand looking at myself in the mirror and when i did i asked ""why do i look like this?"". He also made it a point to mention that ""your personality is great, your looks are not doing you a favor tho"".
You can imagine how bad it hurt to hear those things from the person i loved, and you can also imagine that my dumbass didn't think that MAYBE he was the problem, so i decided to keep things going with him, promising I'd change, I'd exercise and I'd be looking my ""best"" for the summer. Ofc i lied and the way i was planning to lose all the weight was by starving myself.
After a while, he started talking to this girl, which he introduced to me as ""hot af, if you looked like her, with your personality, that would be perfect"". Y'all...when i tell you i fucking SNAPPED. I literally said ""no hold on"" and went on a rant on how he hurt me, how i didn't like this new chick, that he lied to me, that he ruined so many things for me (music, series, jewelry etc), brought my confidence to the fucking ground. He seemed very uninterested in what i said, but it felt good getting it out. We broke up. He kept messaging me for a while, i replied until my father pointed out ""is this what you really want to do with your time, after how dirty he did you?"".
So i stopped talking to him for good, started working on my confidence, on getting used to loving myself and myself ONLY. I accepted my body just the way it is, i am aware of the change that need to be made, but I'll do them for me and my health, not some mommy's boy. I'm out here, looking my best, feeling myself, showing myself off, improving my skills and personality. It's all coming together y'all!!!!

Anyway, this was really long, but the bottom line is: i know some relationships are very toxic, mine wasn't nearly as bad as others, but it doesn't take much for a person to bring you down. Some people get to know you and your insecurities, then use that to get in your head, ruin your self image and manipulate you into thinking stuff like ""well, I'm shit, but they love me like this, even though they treat me bad. I'll stay"". I know it's hard but you need to remember that you deserve better and nothing bad will happen if you choose to love yourself. It's especially hard to tell that someone is bringing you down when they try to sugarcoat the mean shit they say and use the excuse ""i wanted the best for you"".

TL;DR: I broke up with the guy that ruined my confidence and now I'm finally getting back on my feet. :)",1613958476.0

How do I politely tell my future mother in law that I don't appreciate her comments about my weight?,92,ll6lgq,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ll6lgq/how_do_i_politely_tell_my_future_mother_in_law/,17,"My fiance's parents came to visit us last weekend.  They last saw us on Christmas.  His mother made SEVERAL comments about how I've lost weight.   I don't own a scale, but I'm fairly certain I have not lost weight in he 6 weeks since I saw her, but I have slimmed a bit since March.  My fiance and I have been trying to be healthier as a couple, and quarantine has actually been good for us because we made a point to go on hikes every weekend and we cook at home more, but my goal has not been to lose weight.   While I am a bit self conscious of my body and the weight I have put on in the past 5 years, I am quite happy with how my wedding dress looks on me and  I do not have a goal to ""slim down"" for my wedding.   I'm trying to shift my mindset to loving my body as it is by feeding it healthy foods and exercising it in ways that bring me joy. 

I know she means well, but the excited comments on how I've lost weight send the message that there was something wrong with me before.   I fluctuate for many reasons and I don't need her commentary on it.    Any advice?",1613490507.0

"Journalist hopeful for people to interview for story about ""Zoom Dysmorphia""",17,ldba9w,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ldba9w/journalist_hopeful_for_people_to_interview_for/,1,"Good day,

I've consulted with the moderators of this forum and have been given permission to post this solicitation for interviewees. I thank you for your consideration.

My name is Michael Stahl and I'm a writer in New York City \[[www.michaelstahlwrites.com](https://www.michaelstahlwrites.com/)\]. I'm working on a story for InsideHook \[[www.insidehook.com/author/michael-stahl](https://www.insidehook.com/author/michael-stahl)\] about Zoom Dysmorphia, a new category of body dysmorphia where people who engage with video-conferencing platforms grow disgruntled with the way they look on camera. If you search around the internet, you'll find it's leading to an uptick in plastic surgery requests.

If you are someone who's struggling with Zoom Dysmorphia and would be open to an interview about it, I'd really appreciate the chance to talk. You can remain anonymous if you like, and though I prefer phone calls, interviews can be arranged in other ways, like through text or email messaging.

Please let me know a few details of your symptoms and some steps you may have taken to combat them in a message on Reddit or in an email through my website. If you look through my work, you'll find that I report from a place of empathy and sensitivity, and this process won't be any different.

I thank you again for reaching out if you feel so inclined.

Best, Michael",1612543698.0

it wasn’t until i found out he’s had a negative image of his body since he was a kid, thinking he was fat when he was a very normal weight, that i found that he *really* dislikes his body.

Feeling really guilty for accidentally giving a backhanded compliment,43,l1g5jh,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/l1g5jh/feeling_really_guilty_for_accidentally_giving_a/,7,"EDIT: She has since replied to my apology and said that she wasn’t personally offended by my comment but some people may be. Which is fair enough. 

A girl on tik tok was showing an insecurity she has of her body, back fat. This has been my biggest insecurity about my body so I wanted to compliment her on doing so. 

I said ‘It makes me so happy to see people talking about back fat because it’s my biggest insecurity and I never see anyone with as much back fat as me’. 

It wasn’t until she replied that my comment was offensive that I realised how backhanded it sounds. It sounds like I’m saying that she has a lot of back fat when that’s not what I meant, I actually have a lot more back fat than her. 

What I meant was that I never see anyone with as much back fat as me, that’s why it’s such an insecurity of mine. But it makes me really happy to see people talking about it. 

I’ve apologised and explained myself but I just wanted to share this because compliments might not sound how you intend them to. Things can get taken the wrong way if you don’t word them carefully enough. I have BDD and the thought of making anyone feel bad about their body breaks my heart. 

I should’ve just been a bit more considerate when writing my comment and now I have to pay the price by feeling a bit guilty because of it.",1611170062.0

Body neutrality has been wayyyy more helpful for me than trying to convince myself that I’m conventionally beautiful,209,kz98uq,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/kz98uq/body_neutrality_has_been_wayyyy_more_helpful_for/,12,"Okay so I am not disabled or plus size, and I have a lot of privilege there. There are many people who would say that there are elements of my body that are conventionally attractive.

However, after struggling with an eating disorder and agonizing dissatisfaction with my face, I discovered body neutrality. And for me it is not being “neutral” about my body. 

Body neutral usually just means not thinking much about your body, but for me it also means that no body is inherently more beautiful than another. We just have whatever body we have, and the aesthetic value assigned to that body is entirely socially constructed. ENTIRELY. THERE IS BARELY ANY SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR IT. 

And THIS is why we should be neutral about the way our bodies look and not think about it too much. Our bodies are wonderful meatsuits that do lots of cool shit and allow us to live, even when we are disabled and not able to live the same way that others do. Being pretty whatever that means is not even on the list of your body’s priorities",1610900201.0

I love comics, but most don’t represent body acceptance at all. Even if it would make more sense in the story. You mostly only see the ideal body type.

I thought it would make more sense for me to write my warrior Princess MC as a plus size woman because their lands are more bountiful as far as food goes. They have plenty of animals to kill, and their crops flourish.

It’s also a bit more realistic, because back then irl that was a sign of wealth and was not looked down upon at all. Although it’s still fantasy, so I don’t really care about being historically accurate.

I feel like if we as a society began representing different body types more, than there wouldn’t be so much of a toxic negative stigma around it. So I’m gonna do it. As an author my writing can make a change. Writers and authors do that all the time. They’ll write in their own personal views into fictional stories.

Anyone else struggle with very large breasts?

I would like to start by saying I am a 36K in bras 36H in the UK. I have had very large breasts for my frame since a young age and when I was much slimmer I was a 32H. It’s been a couple years and after putting on some weight it feels like it all goes there. I’ve always felt extremely insecure about them especially the attention that comes with them. I usually wear baggier stuff to hide them and it feels like everytime I wear something for form fitting or lower cut it seems like someone always comments.   But I am trying to make peace with them as I love clothes and fashion and would love to wear different things. It feels like nothing ever looks right on me because of them which hurts my self esteem and I feel like I have rather cartoonish proportions. It feels like even when I wear stuff that people with large breasts recommend I look ridiculous. While I’m pursuing a breast reduction right now, until that gets sorted out I would like to enjoy dressing. Being in the r/abrathatfits subreddit has made me realize a lot more people than I thought have my bust and even bigger & my bra fits great thanks to them. I feel like a lot of people with D cups try to give me advice on dressing but there’s a very big difference between us and while I know they mean well and appreciate it, it’s a bit different. Those are still large breasts of course but you know what i mean. I’m trying to get used to wearing more form fitting clothing and shutting down people who comment but if any of you have any support or tips as someone with a very large bust or knowing someone who does, I would really appreciate it.

- We reject the idea that our body is **TOO**.  Too fat, thin, short, tall. Too different from what society tries to say, which changes like the wind.

- We reject the	idea that our body's imperfections make us less of a person.

- We reject the idea of what ""diet culture"" tell us: that we *should* or *shouldn't* eat this or that, that we have to restrict what we eat, that we have to punish ourselves if we eat ""wrong.""

- We reject the ideas that body weight is the same as health, that being fat or thin is automatically healthy or unhealthy, and that our body weight defines our looks or our value.

- We reject the idea that we have to change our bodies to have a good body. **ALL** bodies are good bodies.


#We Accept Ourselves

- We accept that we don't always have to love ourselves, but we can find peace and acceptance.

- We accept our body's imperfections.



- We accept that we are a unique being on the planet.

- We accept that our differences in our bodies are what make us unique.

- We accept ourselves, as we are, and there's nobody more important to
accept that.

Does everyone look at themselves in the mirror and judge themselves?,4,ko0mjf,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ko0mjf/does_everyone_look_at_themselves_in_the_mirror/,4,"For some reason I feel only certain people do but I like to think it's more common than people think. Of course we can't see what people do behind doors but I thought I was the only weirdo taking constant selfies of myself and realized lots of others do it to. I'm guessing if you're more confident you spend less time looking at yourself, it's just a matter of whats going on in your mind as you're doing so. I wish I could stop judging myself but I realize it will never go away entirely. I guess one of the reasons to have a mirror in the first place is to recognize your flaws so you can fix it.",1609457746.0

Teaching myself to sew is challenging me to be comfy with my body,60,k920e4,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/k920e4/teaching_myself_to_sew_is_challenging_me_to_be/,2,"one of the reasons I wanted to learn to sew is to make my own wedding dress. I'm currently in the design process rn. I also love owning one of a kind clothing and want to customize my entire wardrobe at some point. 

Additionally clothing has often been frustrating because I am not shaped in the conventional fashion shape despite being a medium size. I'm very boxy, short waist and most of my curves are from the front and back not on the sides lol. This makes finding nice garments that fit my body in ways that i find appealing annoyingly difficult sometimes as I've had to teach myself hand alteration since i was like 16. 

I'm learning to sew garments for myself I've developed a new appreciation and sense of ease for my body. mostly because something i noticed is that in couture sewing everything EVERYTHING is about illusion. Dress forms are PADDED to the SHAPE OF THE CLIENT and you know what???? all these rich couture fuckers are just as ""lumpy"" as you and me!!! because that's what bodies are! soft cute meat and flesh bags! Even historical clothing. they weren't all waifs (tho some were) there was structure and padding and MORE LIES built into corsets 😅. There were garments let out with little stitches and even paneling. 

That shape, that ""silhouette"" is all about fit, and construction and little secret lies 😅. so it doesn't fucking matter if i don't have a 25 inch waist to match my 34 inch bust cuz darts, lining, underlining, boning and petticoats HAVE GOT MY BACK.

Also low key i may switch to wearing nothing but 1940s style circle skirt dresses from now on because my God they are fucking comfy and make me feel good. And what's the point of learning all this shit if i can't do whatever the fuck i want.

Needless to say learning the art of clothes has made me spent more time with my body and its structure and triggering things like measurements. I have also come to see measurements in a creative sense and not a ""diet and exercise sense"". I spend more time bending the world to fit me rather than bending me to fit the damn world. And fuck it if my body changes it changes! This is why we build ease into the seam allowance!",1607423781.0

The way media (literally) picks women apart by body parts,111,k8avn8,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/k8avn8/the_way_media_literally_picks_women_apart_by_body/,15,"Recently I've felt insecure about my boyfriend watching porn. It's not so much the porn itself, but moreso that he  specifically looks up different female body parts/body types that are diametrically opposed to mine. As a way to try to understand his perspective I started watching more porn myself and tried to put myself in his shoes (sounds weird but it works for me). 

I went to the porn browser and tried to look up porn featuring men with specific physical characteristics I find attractive, and guess what? Nothing. For example, I typed in ""tall man"" and it all came up with ""amazonian tall women"" videos. Lol. No wonder women objectify ourselves and are a million times more insecure than the average man. I wonder how men would feel if we did the same to them. Even if we wanted to, the option doesn't even exist.",1607320460.0

I’m obese,56,k7kush,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/k7kush/im_obese/,12,"I have always thought I was fat my entire life (even at five years old!!) even though I wasn’t. Looking back at pictures, I can see now that I wasn’t fat at all. 

But there’s no denying it now (I’m 54 and over 200 pounds) - and I don’t want to upset anyone by saying this - but how do you stop hating yourself for how you look? Because I can’t deny it anymore; I loathe myself. 

Why can’t I be like some people who love themselves no matter their weight? Logically I know ones weight is not important - my husband is overweight too, and I still love him and it doesn’t matter to me - but why can’t I hold myself to the same standard?

However, as we're moving into what will surely become a second COVID  lockdown, I've noticed that working out is FABULOUS for my mental health, especially since I can't get out much in the first place. However, doing so is sometimes hard because I think I go back to old thinking habits about how I could use my workouts to change my body to make it more ""ideal."" I'm also a little bummed that I'm not as strong/fast as I used to be, but I'm trying to turn that around by celebrating what my body is capable of doing \*today\*. 

For those of you who work out regularly, how have you created a healthy relationship with fitness?

Anyone grow up with a Mom who constantly bashed her own looks....

It's so deeply ingrained in me. 

I feel awful about this but to this day I cringe when people say I look like my Mom because I've only ever heard her talk poorly of her appearances. She always tells me, ""our body type is so similar"", and it makes me feel like shit because I grew up learning from her that she had a ""bad"" body. At the same time she's always saying it's ridiculous that I think I'm ugly, that I'm objectively beautiful, etc. 

I also once brought up the idea of being a musician to her, just dreaming about it when I was a teenager. Her response was something along the lines of, ""I would say you shouldn't pursue that if you were ugly. But you just might have enough looks to make it work!"". Not the talent, not the grit, not the brains. The looks. No wonder I put so much emphasis on it today. It's the little things that stick with you, I swear.

Specks on my stomach have made me feel insecure.,1,jzz5zm,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jzz5zm/specks_on_my_stomach_have_made_me_feel_insecure/,7,"To continue from the title, these spots are a shade lighter than my skin and I’m pretty tan (I’ve had them checked out but they just seem to be some sort of birthmark). Anyways I’ve had these basically my whole life, but since I became more aware of my body (typical age 13 I’m currently 18) I’ve felt self conscious about them. Especially because I feel like they make my skin look strange and uneven. (This is probably my body dysmorphia speaking partly) I want to at least accept this part of me more. But I don’t know if this would be seen as an undesirable or “bad” trait. My bf has told me he likes them because they are unique but I still feel insecure about them.",1606196452.0

How learning about the male gaze taught me to stop hating myself,147,jwxf8v,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jwxf8v/how_learning_about_the_male_gaze_taught_me_to/,17,"This particularly pertains to women, but if you're a guy struggling with body image, and this idea of being watched pertains to you, I hope it helps.

“Women constantly meet glances which act like mirrors reminding them of how they look or how they should look."" In John Berger's *Ways of Seeing*, he ""argues that a woman “is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself."" 

Margret Atwood: ""Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.”

Viv Albertine: “For sixty years I've been shaped by men's point of view on every aspect of my life, from history, politics, music and art to my mind and my body – and centuries more male-centric history before that. I'm saturated with their opinions. I can think and see like a straight white man. I can look at a woman and objectify her, see her how a man sees her.""

Put this way, if I never had to confront my own image ever again; if i lived in a world with no mirrors and body shape had no value, would I still want to lose weight the way I've been trying to lose for the last 10 years?(And I'm fucking 19!) The answer is ""No."" The same way I don't like to wear make-up because it makes me uncomfortable, I don't want to eat 1150 calories everyday. I'm tired of hating my body for reasons I don't even know. I had been telling myself that I wanted to lose weight ""for myself,"" but I don't mind. I eat food that I like and make me feel good, and so everything else: Does. Not. Matter. I've been a women with a man inside me watching myself and I am so tired of this, I've lost so many years, so many moments, so much energy, so much MONEY, on pleasing the man who lives inside me, watching me. On pleasing the women who have learned to think like men, watching me. I'm going to treat my body the way I would if no one was watching. My body has survived so much, it's time I give myself a break.",1605766084.0

I need some encoragement TW: ED,20,jvydll,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jvydll/i_need_some_encoragement_tw_ed/,26,"So, I decided to order some clothes becuase I have gained some weight and I am not really liking how some of my current clothes are looking. I have been wanting to create a personal style and I want to style myself in the body I have and not spiral into the mindset that I cant have this style because I am fat. I got the clothes today and I ordered a size 18, normally I am a size 16, but I wanted some extra room becuase I wanted to feel confortable in these jeans. I went off that I fit a 16 in Old navy and so I ordered a 18 in GAP and they do not fit and I am devistated. They were these cute mom jeans and they are way to small. Its really rought because I already have a lot of bofy dysmorphia and I kind of wnat to go back to just not even trying ti style myself. I also want to revert back to my ED and just not eat anything. It is so fucking upsetting and I know its dumb to complain about it and I know my self worth is not tied up in my body size, but it feels like a blow to my self confidence. I just want to wear clothes I feel good in but I just can not seem to manage that. Is there anyone who can offer me advice on what to do? I have a really hard time shopping becuase it is very triggering for me and online is a lot easier.

Wanted: Ideas for regular positive posts,17,jtgsc0,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jtgsc0/wanted_ideas_for_regular_positive_posts/,19,"I'd like to crowdsource ideas for a bunch of weekly posts
that are designed to encourage positive content.

Unlike the daily negative post, this would not be required - if
people want to post positive content outside these posts, it's
encouraged. The more positivity here, the better!

The idea is that instead of a daily ""positivity"" post we do some
specifically themed thing on specific days - we can try 2 or 3 to
start, unless there's a pile of ideas.  An idea might be a ""What made
you feel good this week?"" on Fridays.  (You don't have to specify a
day with an idea.)


So, this is how this will work:

**- All top comments must be ideas for a weekly post.** Anything else will be removed. You can leave comments on top comments, though, if you have thoughts on them.

**- Ideas must fit the rules/ideals of this sub.**

**- If you like an idea, give it an upvote.**  Votes are not visible to avoid influencing people.

**- If you want to discuss this overall idea, please use the stickied thread.**


I want to hear your ideas!",1605276064.0
Can you have trauma about physical activity?,31,jt8rmy,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jt8rmy/can_you_have_trauma_about_physical_activity/,30,"I’m 27 and I feel I’ve gotten pretty far in my journey with body acceptance. Like most, I have my days, etc, etc, but overall I’m okay being in this body. 

I’ve been working from home due to the pandemic since March and my activity level has gone way way down. I wasn’t a super active person even before, but my job kept me on my feet and I live in NYC so I walked a lot. 

Now, however, I rarely leave my house so I am barely moving. I want to get more physically active for the first time in my life *truly* just for my health. The problem is, any time I think about trying a new physical activity (biking, running, dance, etc) I feel like my brain automatically panics and I’m thrown back into all the years where I was doing it simply to lose weight. 

I remember I used to enjoy (I think—hard to separate out sometimes) running, and so I googled “running for out of shape beginners” and the moment I started reading it I just started crying. I think I feel scared that I will “fail” like I “used to” even though I know since I don’t have a goal BUT my health, that’s not possible. 

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any ideas on how to get back into it or just work through it mentally? I know a lot of people will probably suggest just taking walks, but it’s hard for me to motivate myself to do that when I know it’s so minimal. (Although I know, still better than nothing).

Any thoughts, feelings, or advice are appreciated.",1605234348.0

Then, someone points out something that I never noticed before. What do you mean my ears are really small?

Now I’m self-conscious. I’m out in public, feeling like all eyes are on me. I lose confidence. I avoid situations where people can see my imperfection. Finally, at a social gathering, I mention it. “yeah, my ears are really small.”
“Oh, that’s right. They are! I never noticed.” They never noticed, or cared. I’m not the center of the universe. I understand that there’s a privilege when your imperfection isn’t extremely visible, but these moments are great reminders that even if it’s out there for all to see, most people don’t care. They have their own things to worry about. You are the center of your own universe, not theirs. They don’t stay up at night thinking about that thing. Only you do.

"“Well actually, I’m fat.”",159,jd64it,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jd64it/well_actually_im_fat/,8,"Today while in a group call, I got trapped in an uncomfortable conversation. After someone made a slight self-jab about their own weigh, their friend tried to reassure them. Their friend said they where actually just husky and not “fat” at all.   

This lead to a painstakingly long and in-depth conversation where the theme was more or less “Being fat is really bad, but you’re \*not\* fat so it’s fine :)  

As someone who **is** fat, like “actually” fat. And had their whole life ruined by this kind of mindset, this conversation was starting to bother me. So eventually I managed to push through my social anxiety to say something.

I told a group of people that I was fat, and that I was perfectly fine with it. It wasn’t this horrible big deal they where making it out to be. I’m fat and there’s nothing wrong with that!  

If someone had suggested to me, a couple of years ago. That I would be able to say something like that out-loud to other people, and actually believe it. I would have called them a big ol’ liar.    

It such a small thing, but it’s a nice reminder that I’m making progress.

Isn’t the root of body image issues a deep rooted fear of being unlovable? Also something that helped me.,42,jd3jym,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jd3jym/isnt_the_root_of_body_image_issues_a_deep_rooted/,11,"Hey everyone, 30 yo ftm (trans man) here. As I believe everyone struggles with body image, I have really thought about it’s root, at least for myself, and am wondering if this is true for everyone or if I’m just projecting my own reasons onto others.

I grew up being called the “second ugliest” girl in school (by “friends”), compared to “ugly” men, ya know, regular old teen bullying, just more aimed at my masculinity as a female. When I was younger I remember my feelings being somewhat hurt, but not in the way I think other people may take things to heart.

Only when I transitioned did I begin to care about my appearance at all. But with what I gained from exogenous hormones, I recognize I can lose at any time. My hair is thinning, I’m sure to be bald in a couple years, my skull is very obviously female in my opinion, which hair tends to hide. I know everything I have come to appreciate about my body will leave one day, and that had me afraid. 

I’ve done a lot of searching for the source, as I remember being very strongly about “the inside that counts” up until I actually liked how I looked and was treated differently.

I realized that I fear being alone, as everyone probably does. I fear being not cared about, my appearance for some reason making people not want to associate with me as I age into a small balding man creature.

Because of this fear of being bald, I decided to go ahead and shave my head completely. It was the most freeing thing I’ve done recently. No one treats me any differently, my fiancée loves me all the same, and I’ve essentially faced some of the fears I have surrounding aging (going from “undesirable” to “desirable” and likely back to “ugly”).

But much of this was in my head. Of course some people said things about bald not suiting me, asking why I shaved my head, etc, but for the vast majority of people, they love me all the same.

Ok your turn: WHY do you fear being “ugly” so badly? And is there anything, even something small, you could do right now to face that fear, at least to some extent?

Thanks everyone!",1602970074.0

Storytime,14,jbfak5,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jbfak5/storytime/,12,"Just wanted to let go of some cruel comments that have been said about me throughout my life. Here’s a list of all the insults about my weight that I remember, and occasions where people treated me differently due to my appearance.

Elementary
-Boy comes up to me and says, “You’re f a t .”
-I had a crush on a boy. We were at recess and somehow some kid who knew about my crush told him. The kid said, “Ewwww” even though I was right there.

Middle school
-on ask.fm one night, my first cyber bully experience: “how many rolls do you have pig” I remember feeling like I went cold and I had to close my laptop. Huge hit to my self esteem.

High school
-Friend told me the worst thing anyone had ever said to her was that her thighs were big
-Same friend said to our group, “If you want to lose weight, just don’t eat anything most of the day”
-The guy I lost my virginity to ran for the hills the first time after we had sex, acting like he never wanted to hang out with me again. He insisted that I keep it a secret (I didn’t, I told my friends who later spread it around). Then he started dating a skinny girl later that year and I felt awful (until I got over his bitch ass).
-Rejected by a friend based on my weight. Overheard him making a comment on the phone (talking to a mutual friend of ours) saying I was too fat for him to hook up with. (yeah, we’re not friends anymore)
-Same guy later said he didn’t want to see me naked when we were playing a game where you had to strip (I don’t remember how the game went). He was like “Ugh I don’t want to see that!” Perhaps he was just saying he didn’t want to see a friends private parts, but seriously, if you’re gonna think a negative comment about someone’s body, keep it to yourself.
-Girl friend said, “It’s crazy how you were the first one of us to lose your virginity. You know what I mean?” No, I don’t know what you mean. It shouldn’t be crazy or surprising for fat girls to have sex.
-Other girl friend commented on our other friends body, who is smaller than I am. “Not that it matters, but did you notice that <friends name> gained weight?” I just gave her a look and said “If it doesn’t matter, why are you saying anything about it?”

I’m sure there’s more, but those are the ones that come to my mind from time to time. Any ones stick out to you as being particularly horrible?",1602729676.0

I am new to this community. Please let me know if this post is inappropriate for this sub! 

My partner and I are looking for supportive chairs for fat people. In the last two years, we have gone through two different couches because they have been so uncomfortable with not enough support. At this time, we are considering a couple of supportive recliners or other options like this, hoping that it might be cheaper than buying another couch, only to find that it can't hold our cute round bodies like we'd hoped. What chairs/couches do you have that you love? Any tips for looking?

"Every vulva is different, every vulva is normal and every vulva is beautiful!",106,j3uxs4,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/j3uxs4/every_vulva_is_different_every_vulva_is_normal/,3,"There are 8 main reasons why it is important for you and everyone to cast their vulvas and turn them into a statue. Today I will introduce to you reason nr. 1:

Every vulva that is cast increases the diversity displayed in the gallery. This gives yourself as well as other people the possibility to see how different vulvas can look. Many unrealistic, body shaming and simply ridiculous beauty ideals have managed to turn into socially accepted standards and norms.

By showing the diversity and the reality of how vulvas can look, Vulvarium and every person participating are part of a rebellion against these depictions. It helps to make us all understand again that every vulva is normal and that every vulva is beautiful. And that we were all born perfect.

I gave myself a buzz cut after decades of long hair,13,j3v2rr,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/j3v2rr/i_gave_myself_a_buzz_cut_after_decades_of_long/,5,"TLDR I always felt uncomfortable valuing my looks and relied on my long hair to make me feminine. Now, I've buzzed my head so I can explore my femininity and challenge myself. I love it!!!

I gave myself a buzz cut this week.

At first, I brought it up as a joke. It was always a tiny fantasy, but seemed unrealistic. But once I started thinking about it, I started realizing how possible it was. I'm working from home now, so I wouldn't have to be confronted with a million opinions about it from all around. If I hate it, I'll have time to grow it out a bit. In the meantime, my hair will finally be out of my way and maintenance-free. It just became this itch I need to scratch.

I've been thinking a lot about my femininity. I was a Tom boy, then I became the fat kid. Boys said ""eww"" when talking about me. I felt unable to express my sexuality. Like, I would never admit to having a crush as a teenager. That would just be setting myself up for ridicule. Same with my looks. I enjoyed being a Tom boy in many ways, but I saw girls wearing cool gothic makeup and tight clothes. I wanted to do those things, but I felt too ugly. 

In college, I started expressing my sexuality a little as it felt safer and I wanted more male attention. It worked, but I still received a lot of negative reactions from guys.  So I wouldn't go too far with trying to look nice. I still felt too ugly.

Since then, I've been kinda stuck. Life has gotten much, much better! I've found acceptance and it's easier when you're older to create a life around the positive. But I still feel embarrassed to wear a lot of makeup, or things like dresses. It still feels like I'm not supposed to put worth into my looks.

What does this have to do with my hair? Well, my hair is my security blanket. I look feminine because I have this long, nice hair. It's the one thing that was complimented when I was younger. I cut my hair once and was misgendered a few times, so I swore to never cut it again. I felt like I needed my hair to be a woman.

But that's not true! And I want to explore the other sides of my femininity. I want to play with my looks. I want to appreciate my body and let myself be expressive through it. I want to expose myself and be vulnerable because I feel strong enough now to take it and grow from it.

I definitely had to watch a lot of videos and read stories to get prepared. I love that you can YouTube ""fat woman head shave"" and see other women that look like me going through the process. They looked amazing so it really gave me confidence.

By shaving my head, I'm forced to express my femininity in other ways. I won't be able to hide behind my hair. I took off the security blanket and I'm honestly really excited. I've already been having a blast trying new, bolder looks. I love it!!!",1601647521.0

Message for the guys:,144,izias7,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/izias7/message_for_the_guys/,34,"Hey ❤

I don't know if this is right group to post this in, but I think it is. I just wanted to let you, yes you, know that you're appreciated just the way you are. So here are some reminders you might need:

• it's okay if you are not okay, it will get better
• crying doesn't make you weak or less of a man
• you look so much better than you think you do
• if you want to talk about feelings, just do it, and if u have nobody to talk about it, just hit me up I will listen

Still reading? Good. I've got some body image reminders aswell.

• you don't have to be muscled. You really don't have to be. Skinny or chubby, or any body is just as beautiful
• your dick doesn't have to be big. You cant change anything about it. So girls just gotta shut up and enjoy your amazing company
• many girls say they want tall men, but in the end it really doesn't matter that much, i promise
• body hair? Great! No body hair? Great aswell. Balding? Not a bad thing at all!

Maybe you read this and you think its bullshit, thats fine. I just hope at least 1 guy reads it and feels a tiny bit better.

Love❤",1601035886.0
Someone sent me a picture of myself.,40,iz994r,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/iz994r/someone_sent_me_a_picture_of_myself/,6,"I'm really working on just being okay with my body and *really* believing that I'm not bad because of my body. I've made a lot of progress, and it feels like I've gone way backwards.

My mom and my aunts are obsessed with family pictures--those stupid, shitty posed ones where no one looks comfortable and the only memory attached to them is being annoyed. At my cousin's outdoor birthday party a couple of weeks ago, they all insisted that we gather round and take a few photos. They said we'd thank them one day. I never look at any of those pictures...

Well, my aunt texted me today and I had to see myself. I've bee trying to ease into pictures--take them at different angles to remember that a photo is not my self. But I can't stop thinking about this picture. How I don't feel like the person in that picture. How I know that most people in my life equate thinness with health. 

I just wish I could see a picture of myself and feel okay. Neutral. And I wish I could get my family to believe me when I say how much those pictures bother me.",1600993380.0

Ode to My Belly

I am wearing a shirt that is form-fitting. 
It isn’t tight. 
But it leaves nothing to the imagination. 
Namely, it shows my protruding belly. 
I can’t hide it with this top. 
I like this top because of its design. 
Who cares if my belly pokes out?
My belly has been through a lot these last 29 years. 
It has grown a lot. 
Why do I hate its growth?
Growth means progress. 
Growth involves change. 
Growth is a good thing when it comes to plants. 
Why can’t I be allowed to grow?",1600623244.0

**TW: Eating Disorder & Disordered Eating Content**

WE ARE STRICTLY an **AWARENESS** page.

We are **NOT** an E.D. TREATMENT nor EDUCATION SITE.

F\*ck Eating Disorders a.k.a., F\*CK(ED), is a platform dedicated to showcasing the rise in disordered eating content online while promoting anti-diet culture + body positive imagery. We take a **bold and transparent stance against the glamorization and normalization of disordered eating content on social media** that pursues unrealistic #bodygoals. With tiktok, snapchat, instagram, photoshop, facetune, and plastic surgery, comes a host of social and mental health consequences, specifically, the rise in disordered eating. Our generation IS DIFFERENT. We learn and engage with the media to the point where it becomes so integral to our identities and daily routines. To fight against Pro-Eating Disorder Culture, F\*CK(ED) strives to give the public media literacy and facts based on the current influences, diets, and trends of today. Together, we believe that society can collectively shape a future that is free from diet culture pressure and ideals of achieving the “perfect body”.

My penis is nothing special, and could be considered small.  My nose is comically wide - my mother comments on it when drunk.  I'm not short, but in that area of average that most people think short.  The car accident left me with a large surgical hernia where you can see my intestines slivering around within - it  can't be fixed.  


I just want to let you know that I have had other men mock me for my penis, and I've had people break up with me specifically for my health problems.  Possibly a partner mentioned my penis size, if I'm remembering correctly.  I don't like my body.  


BUT

I'm in a wonderful relationship, and it's not the only one I've been in.  You can be too.   I'm not rich.  There's not a notable way that in my opinion, I should be loved.  But I'm very loving and empathetic to my partners within my capabilities, and that love has been returned to me even when I don't deserve it.  Be open to the idea that you can be loved.  Love yourself and be willing to express your love vulnerably.  You will be hurt, but that's not the only thing you'll find.",1600068162.0

How do I nurture a sense of body positivity in my teenage sister?,50,ip2qz7,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ip2qz7/how_do_i_nurture_a_sense_of_body_positivity_in_my/,31,"My sister (13) just admitted to me that she sometimes feels bad about her body. She keeps referring to her body as a skeleton and I don’t know what to do to help her.

My mother is verbally abusive when she can’t get her way eg if my sister won’t finish eating something my mother will start yelling out that my sister needs to eat because she’s too skinny. My mother constantly comments on our appearance and always has, whether it be our hair, weight, height etc.

I don’t think my sister is skinny because of an ED. Her diet could be better but I think her relationship with food is normal.

She’s overall a very grounded kid and I don’t think it’s turned into anything nefarious but I’m not waiting around for that to happen before I start helping her.

She’s aware that images on the internet aren’t always what they seem, and I’ve always let her know that she has control over what she consumes on social media (meaning she doesn’t have to follow influencers who edit pics and that it can be damaging to follow them even if it seems harmless)

I’m looking for further advice on how I can instil healthy body image in her beyond just telling her. Because of my mother I make sure to shower her in affirmations but I want her to grow to learn in her own mind that she’s so perfect the way she is.

I feel that the body acceptance movement picks and chooses who they support. It drives me slightly mad lol,99,io5g8v,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/io5g8v/i_feel_that_the_body_acceptance_movement_picks/,28,"So I want to preface this by saying that everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their body. The fact that this movement has gained popularity at all is a massive win for society, and is a thing to celebrate. 

However, I feel like the movement is very one sided. It focuses nearly exclusively on people that are larger in body shape, whilst seemingly ignoring the people who are slighter. 

You may rebuttal this by saying that people that are slighter don't need the movement, that they've always been accepted, they're what society wrongly views as ""healthy"", ""attractive"", ""ideal"". And to that, I will agree.. but not wholely. 

I'm going to use one example, as it's the example that is currently, and I feel like always will be, a massive problem for me. Bra fit. I am very tall and very skinny. my bra size is a 26a. That size doesn't exist outside of training bras and the very, very few small bra companies that sell bras about £100 each (how on earth do they ever sell any?!). The body acceptance movement has (rightly) campaigned for bras for bigger busts and band sizes to be available in most lingerie and high street shops. Now I can go into Debenhams, Ann summers, Primark, and find hundreds of bras for women with larger chests, yet there is absolutely nothing for women with smaller chests. 

One massive issue I have with this, is that women with smaller chests are bullied, teased, name called, portrayed as wrong in media day in day out. I was bullied in school for many reason, but mainly for having a small chest. I've had a man I was talking to ask me to call him ""when I got surgery"". Not if, when. I am so insecure about my boobs. I hate them. I wish everyday that I could be normal and have an average sized chest. Yet the body acceptance movement has nothing for me. Theres no campaigns for small bras, there's no representation in ads or models, particularly lingerie models. Whenever there is an ad showcasing many body types, it's very one sided. average - large, no slighter. 

I constantly see posts about how there are so many pretty bras for people with small boobs, yet none for people with big boobs. That is just wrong. There are no bras for people with small boobs, full stop. I absolutely agree that there should be more feminine, cute bras for large busts. but I also really, really need a bra that fits me. Any bra. I don't care! I just want a bra!",1599476493.0
[Rant Only],22,inxclj,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/inxclj/rant_only/,4,"What gives people the right to criticize someone else on their weight? I've struggled with my weight for years and what you say does affect how someone feels about their body. As hard as it is to lose weight it's just as hard to gain weight. STOP JUDGING and be a decent respectful human being and keep your mouth closed. People can have underlying medical issues, on medication, have eating disorders, going through things you don't understand or have a pre-existing condition that make it hard to gain or lose weight. So please stop assuming things. People come in various shapes. We don't all look the same. My stomach can't handle large amounts of food no matter how much I train my stomach to expand (yes that is a thing). I've tried and ended up in the ER with a partial blockage. I've had a woman come up to me and TOUCHED MY ARM AT A RESTURANT while I was eating with my family and said ""Wow you're so petite, how much do you weigh?"". I thought I was being pranked. I couldn't open my mouth to speak and froze in place trying to process what was happening. All I could do was sit and laugh awkwardly staring at my husband almost pleading for him to say something. I couldn't believe this woman grabbed me and asked me such a personal question. While at work two employees on two separate occasions have said, ""Dang girl you need to eat a hamburger. You're so small!"" and ""Aren't you a tiny little thing!"" The fact that someone had the nerve to say these things to my face baffles me. I'm so grateful my husband stood up for me on one of those occasions. I hate to admit this but I still feel nervous going out in public and am even more self aware with my body and my surroundings and constantly need validation from my husband (thank god I have a loving honest man). At my age I'm ashamed to feel this way. It wouldn't bother me as much if this happened less frequently but it happens more times I can count. Today about did it. I just got back from eating breakfast with my family and I almost broke down in the car on the way home. This time was different. Felt more personal. I was at my breaking point. The years of this crap just threw me over the edge. A waitress had the audacity to say, ""Usually the smaller ones order bigger meals"" as I got done completing my order.  Looked at my stepson and said ""you will be the one with the biggest appetite I can tell"", as she looked down at my plate. ""Do you need a to go bag?"" while I was still finishing up my plate! Among other things I don't remember because I was in a state of shock and shame. I felt humiliated and got quiet. I think she knew she had triggered me but at the end of the day I still handled it with class and said thank you for the service but MY GOD did I want to get loud and say something. She just wouldn't STOP.  STOP TALKING ABOUT/CRITICIZING someone's weight to their face especially in front of someone's kids. It doesn't matter who they are, what sex they are and how old they are. If they're strangers, acquaintances, friends or family. Someone online or offline. You have no right unless you know them personally and fear for their safety. But even then be fragile with your words. Children and teens especially feel affected by your words so please be kind. Whether it's intentional or not just use some common sense. You don't know what someone is going through or how their day is going. My husband and I try to be careful talking about weight issues or weight topics around our kids and try to spread body positivity the best way we can. If you have kids be careful and sensitive with what you say around them. Their brains are sponges. They have enough to worry about, hearing about and comparing their bodies from their peers and the internet. And don't be afraid to stick up to anyone who gets bullied on or offline. One small act of kindness can make someone's day. You'd be surpised what a big difference that can make. Thanks for listening!",1599438270.0

I did read the rules So hopefully I do this correctly.  I will say that since I was in Middle school, maybe even the later years of elementary I absolutely had a horrible relationship with my appearance.  I always thought my face was pretty, but my body ALWAYS needed work... if this where only different, or if that where different, then I could love me.  Well I’m also into holistic wellness and I have never done any plastic surgery (even though I don’t knock it, it’s just me own personal preference).  Anyway, because of this I’ve never changed much in a good way, and that only lead me to judge myself and feel worse over the years.  Then at the age of 35 I separated from my husband (fully divorced now!) and started to work on my relationship with myself!  Now I will say I’m in such a better place, however I still have a ways to go.  Thank you for this group!",1599224464.0

This wasn't a random, spur of the moment, ""I didn't know what I was saying!"" thing. Nor is it a matter of preference or desire, this was an outright act of hate and sexism against people who cannot change the bodies they were born with. Shame on her.

today i undressed in front of a mirror, 

and for the first time in months was not 

repelled,

instead ran a hand through the fault lines 

of my body, measured the tectonic tension 

traversing through my thigh bone, 

counted, coddled and named 

each stretch mark 

(Ceres, Homestead, Hebe, Apophis),

observed each tooth jutting like 

peninsula from soft, raw pinkness; 

traced the spiralling of my staircase ears -

two conch shells that have held like water

the music of being, the grain of sound, the torque of vibration 

for years (and years);

surveyed a family of moles, 

a sporadic colony of birthmarks 

-spray of pigment and genetics and sunshine, 

cupped a stomach swollen like a wort moon

(thanked my belly for being the limbo that holds 

my grief & fear & joy & sorrow when 

they have no home to go 

to) 

today i

saw, for the first time, imprinted like chondrites in this 

scrapbook skin I call home, 

story after story after story begging 

to be retold.

asked myself 

if there really was some small scintilla of 

life kicking 

somewhere in this accidental vessel;

asked myself if i really exist

and for the first time in a long time

wondered, 

in childish disbelief.


yes

yes I do

Sex for acceptance,18,ihlbmf,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ihlbmf/sex_for_acceptance/,7,"I've only just realized that I'm not too happy with my body. This might have been the case from a long time ago but I've only just seemed to accept it and realise when I'm making the mistake of trying to get acceptance from other of my body. I know im not st my finest state, but its not as bad as it could yet and is also not as good as it could get. And whenever I happen to meet someone new and I feel like the only thing i offer is my personality and if they aren't attracted to that my body is next and those 2 things should aline and be exactly what anyone would ever want. I'm happy with my personality although I can get nervous and tall much more than needed but im satisfied. It takes a certain type of person to bring out an intelligent ans interesting side of me. But the mintue someone doesn't respond to my personality so well, I automatically thing its because of my body and I try ao hard to get that through different guys, very good looking guys that would sleep with me and that would inturn make me feel accpeted. But I dont want to have sex for that reason, I want to have sex for connection and the feeling of warmth. Also it doesn't help that I dont already like my body and I csnt preform the way id want to in bed, as comfortable as I could be. 
I just don't know what to do to be happy with my body. I dont want to simple lose weight and still have the same thinking. I would want to fix my mental state before making chances that could potentially damage me.",1598536050.0

Has anyone ever done a “sexy” photo shoot to attain body acceptance and or confidence and did it work?,46,ih18g5,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ih18g5/has_anyone_ever_done_a_sexy_photo_shoot_to_attain/,14,"This has been suggested to me a number of times but most recently by a concerned friend to help overcome my body dissatisfaction

Even just regular pictures are extremely anxiety inducing, so I’m not super hopeful this would be a magickal turning point for me. The emotional pain will prolly be written all over my face hahaha...Which is why I’d consider buying matching face masks to coordinate with what I wear if I decide to do this.

So I wanna know what was your experience during the shoot and after? Did you ask for some edits to be done? Was it a “glamorous boudoir style” shoot or something different? 

This is not strictly limited to an idea of a “femme orientated photo shoot” I’d love to hear the experiences of anyone who’s posed for a photographer with the aim of gaining more confidence and self-esteem.",1598456720.0

"Advice needed: My friend compliments my body and complains about hers, and I'd really rather just not talk about it..",32,ig9fdj,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ig9fdj/advice_needed_my_friend_compliments_my_body_and/,5,"I have a friend who is very dear to me, but she has a lot of trauma from a family with zero boundaries and I feel like it's spilling over into unwanted (by me)  discussions comparing our bodies.  I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to talk to her about it?  Her family tells her she's gained weight or needs to lose weight every time she visits or calls, and she's had that same shit from coaches as well.  She doesn't even want to go to the gym or run outside at times when too many people might be out and 'see her'. Meanwhile she talks about all the things I can wear that she can't, and is very complimentary, but always followed by bashing herself.  The thing is I have been uncomfortable in my body for a good portion of my life.  I have my own stuff I have disliked about myself at various times that caused intense anxiety.

I made a comment about hating that I could never find a swimsuit that fit right and she and another friend didn't believe me (I'm sure if I looked hard enough I could but I hate both shopping and women's swimsuits with a burning passion, not looking for advice there).  I also binged and purged for several years, though I haven't talked about this with her.  My way of coping with my own negative self feeling was, after years/ months of trying to change various things and staring at the mirror in despair, to decide the mental anguish of caring was not worth it, and to basically 'give up'.  I stopped caring about eating healthy, and that led to  having fewer binges and less post binge depression.  I stopped using a mirror to examine every little thing.  I stopped weighing myself, ever.  I feel happier just not thinking about my body and appearance in general too much. Sometimes I eat healthy sometimes not, but I'm pretty sure not throwing up is probably the health equivalent of quitting smoking, so I feel like that's a win.  Anyways,  The comments comparing us make me self conscious, I feel annoyed that if I ever do comment about a personal frustration I'm not believed, but especially I love my friend and wish she could reject the toxic messages from her family (and society/pop culture) which are a bunch of bs.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to approach talking about this with my friend?  I actually don't want to talk much about my past self hate, it's really a part of my life I'd rather not dwell on. Yet I worry about making her feel like she has to repress her feelings around me, which would be sad.  I ask your collective wisdom, What would be helpful here?",1598350803.0

Normally the idea of stripping down to that little clothing is enough to put me off. I don't know why today was so different. Perhaps I didn't allow myself to think about it. Perhaps you start not to care as much the older you get... I don't know.

I will tell you that it was so liberating to jump in without a care in the world. I will be going again. In fact, I can hardly wait. Hopefully with time it'll get a bit easier and easier.

r/rateme rant,91,i60yv1,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/i60yv1/rrateme_rant/,9,"I got stuck last night browsing r/rateme out of curiosity after someone rated me the lowest of everyone in a group during a ""game"".  

At first I was feeling awful seeing these women I would consider (and I think most would consider) absolutely gorgeous rated a 6/10 or 5/10. Then I noticed that the men who posted were getting much more generous treatment than the women... -__- 

Frankly it was shit for my self esteem and I don't recommend engaging with these subs if you are insecure at all, especially if you have body dysmorphia. But what I realized after it all, is that no matter what the ""consensus"" (aka a bunch of incels on Reddit probably) is about your body and appearance, there is SOMEONE out there who is going to find you a TEN. Your eyes, your nose, your SMILE, your lips, your cheeks, your legs, your feet even will be GORGEOUS to the right person. On top of all that, your worth is in all the other things that make you an absolute fucking unicorn. And what people on the internet think-- likely sad people who are deeply insecure themselves--doesn't matter.

But if you feel like you'll always be lonely/unlovable/unattractive because of some shit rating system, or comment, or standard, that's horse shit. Someone (I'll bet MANY PEOPLE) find you fucking gorgeous.",1596900529.0

I was a chronic dieter for YEARS, which turned into a full blown ED. I am now in recovery (I'll never say recovered as this is such a process) yet I find I still set myself goals and targets all the time. Things like ""I'm going to try and be intuitive until this date"" or ""I fully accept my body and imagine how great I will feel if I keep accepting my body until Christmas"" (etc.) and it is really messing with my head. It's so similiar to the dieting/ED days where I would associate rules with what I ate in restriction terms which would lead to ""messing up"", binging, guilt and more restrictions/rules. I have realised that setting targets on my recovery is going to do exactly the same. The idea of recovery is to take away the rules when it comes to my body but I find myself clinging to them like a comfort blanket even if the end goal is something positive. *Sigh* So today the first of the month..the perfect day for a new goal right?!

Society's perceptions of ideal weight are not helping me,9,hy1ome,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/hy1ome/societys_perceptions_of_ideal_weight_are_not/,5,"I come from a country where ppl's perceptions of ideal weight is a bit distorted. Young celebrities perceived as attractive here are usually all very underweight. I was recommended to be on a diet recently because my body fat percentage was quite high and I didn't have a lot of muscle. Since building muscle takes more time than losing fat, I ended up being underweight to the extent of those celebrities. Since my diet, I experienced hypotension/anemia. Yesterday, I ended up almost passing out. I would have lost consciousness if my parents hadn't found me on time. 

I quickly realized that I was becoming unhealthy. However, whenever I meet ppl or post a picture that shows my full body on social media (ex. dance practice videos), a lot of my friends say that they want my body type. Some even ask me what my current weight is so that they can set it as their target weight. I frequently get comments from strangers when I ride the elevator or walk on the streets saying that I'm lucky that I'm so ""skinny."" I am constantly astonished when I go shopping because I hear ppl tell their daughters/friends they shouldn't buy the clothes I try on because they aren't as ""thin"" as I am and apparently, won't look as good. I feel guilty and even mad when I see the disappointed faces on the little girls when they hear their own mother criticizing their body shape. 

I am confused because as much as I know how unhealthy I am, I feel like my current weight is ideal in the society I live in. Logically, I know that society's perceptions of weight are unhealthy, but I feel myself becoming more stressed when I think about gaining weight again. I don't have any eating disorders but I would like tips on how to deal with these perceptions. How do I maintain a healthy perspective on my body image?",1595742721.0

"No fat friends, not understood IRL",31,hwl5q8,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/hwl5q8/no_fat_friends_not_understood_irl/,24,"I’m new to this whole body acceptance thing. I’m struggling because I don’t feel like ANYONE that I know in real life is able to get on board this with me.

Literally everyone I know that is as big or bigger than me wants to diet. Plus all the people smaller than me that also want to diet.

That is really really hard and I know I can’t be the only one that feels like that. How did you learn to deal with it? Advice?",1595529141.0
Should my penis be identical in colour to the rest of my body?,35,hw60nf,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/hw60nf/should_my_penis_be_identical_in_colour_to_the/,10,"I am a white, 24 year-old male (I turn 25 in two months), and I was always told as a kid that the penis darkens in colour as you get older. Every single adult penis I've seen, whether it be in pornography, sexual health photos, other men in real life, they are all significantly darker than caucasian skin.

But that's never happened with me. My penis is white as hell and I would have thought it would darken by now. Is this normal? Is anyone else in a similar situation? I've been led to believe that white men having a penis the same colour as the rest of their body isn't common, am I wrong in thinking that?

It makes me feel resentful towards my penis because I think it just looks...odd. I'm embarrassed of other people even seeing it.",1595465297.0
